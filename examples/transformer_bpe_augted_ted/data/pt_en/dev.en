TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: At TED2009 , Al Gore presents updated slides from around the globe to make the case that worrying climate trends are even worse than scientists predicted , and to make clear his stance on "clean coal" .
Al Gore: What comes after An Inconvenient Truth ?
Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent .
But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice .
The arctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .
It expands in winter and contracts in summer .
The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years .
The permanent ice is marked in red .
As you see , it expands to the dark blue - that's the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer .
The so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , spilling out of the body here .
In 25 years it's gone from this , to this .
This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it thaws , is turned into methane by microbes .
Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this tipping point .
Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska , methane is actively bubbling up out of the water .
Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter .
Video: Whoa ! Al Gore: She's okay . The question is whether we will be .
And one reason is , this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north .
This is an annual melting river .
But the volumes are much larger than ever .
This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland .
If you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea .
These flows are increasing very rapidly .
At the other end of the planet , Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet .
Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting .
That's equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is Greenland .
In the Himalayas , the third largest mass of ice: at the top you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow .
In the Andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .
The flows have increased .
But when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
In California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snowpack .
This is hitting the reservoirs .
And the predictions , as you've read , are serious .
This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires .
And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate .
Four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
This is a completely unsustainable pattern .
If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
In the last five years we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours - 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific , from the Americas , extending westward , and on either side of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans .
The biggest single cause of global warming , along with deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
Oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
The United States is one of the two largest emitters , along with China .
And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants .
But we're beginning to see a sea change .
Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed .
However there is a political battle in our country .
And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal , which is an oxymoron .
That image reminded me of something .
Around Christmas , in my home in Tennessee , a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled .
You probably saw it on the news .
This , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in America .
This happened around Christmas .
One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one .
Video: ♪♫ Frosty the coal man is a jolly , happy soul .
He's abundant here in America , and he helps our economy grow .
Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday .
He's affordable and adorable , and workers keep their pay .
Al Gore: This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia .
The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal .
Video: Don Blankenship: Let me be clear about it . Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid , they don't know what they're talking about .
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns .
This is one of them , part of one of them .
Video: Actor: At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal .
The fact is , coal isn't dirty .
We think it's clean - smells good , too .
So don't worry about climate change .
Leave that up to us .
Video: Actor: Clean coal - you've heard a lot about it .
So let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility .
Amazing ! The machinery is kind of loud .
But that's the sound of clean coal technology .
And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
Take a good long look: this is today's clean coal technology .
Al Gore: Finally , the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
Video: Narrator: America is in crisis - the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
The thread that links them all: our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
A plan to put America back to work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that's big enough to solve our problems .
Repower America . Find out more .
Al Gore: This is the last one .
Video: Narrator: It's about repowering America .
One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
Man: Future's over here . Wind , sun , a new energy grid .
Man #2: New investments to create high-paying jobs .
Narrator: Repower America . It's time to get real .
Al Gore: There is an old African proverb that says , "If you want to go quickly , go alone .
If you want to go far , go together" .
We need to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this short talk from TED U 2009 , Brian Cox shares what's new with the CERN supercollider . He covers the repairs now underway and what the future holds for the largest science experiment ever attempted .
Brian Cox: What went wrong at the LHC.
Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC .
And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
So this is it . And for those of you that weren't there , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted - 27 kilometers in circumference .
Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
It's nothing if not ambitious .
This is the machine below Geneva .
We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors .
This is the one I work on . It's called the ATLAS detector - 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale .
On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It caused immense celebration in the control room .
It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC , colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately , and showering particles into the detector .
In other words , when we saw that picture on September 10th we knew the machine worked , which is a great triumph .
I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer , or this , when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that .
It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
About a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here - these gold wires .
Those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power .
Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , "No they don't . They're small wires" .
They can do that because when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire .
So at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current .
In one of the joints between over 9 , 000 magnets in LHC , there was a manufacturing defect .
So the wire heated up slightly , and its 13 , 000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
We had to take them out , which we did .
We reconditioned them all , fixed them .
They're all on their way back underground now .
By the end of March the LHC will be intact again .
We will switch it on , and we expect to take data in June or July , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
Now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . It's easy to refute .
I think that the fact that it's so difficult , the fact that we're overreaching , is the value of things like the LHC .
I will leave the final word to an English scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I suspect , when defending his protege's useless experiments - his protege was Michael Faraday - said this , "Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer" .
Thank you .
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: MIT grad student David Merrill demos Siftables - cookie-sized , computerized tiles you can stack and shuffle in your hands . These future-toys can do math , play music , and talk to their friends , too . Is this the next thing in hands-on learning ?
David Merrill: Toy tiles that talk to each other.
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
As you figured out how to reach out and grasp , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships .
Spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects - along with my adviser Pattie , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi - I started to wonder - what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop , what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically.
Arranging it the way we wanted ?
This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer , by building Siftables .
In a nutshell , a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie .
They're able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
Most importantly , they're physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and grasping .
And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information .
And as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nuance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles .
So , I'm going to start with some simple examples .
This Siftable is configured to show video , and if I tilt it in one direction , it'll roll the video this way ; if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards .
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
So if I put them next to each other , they get interested .
If they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flustered .
And they can also sense their motion and tilt .
One of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid .
So in this case , we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mixed .
If we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back .
There are also some neat possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
So here I'm - This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program .
Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle .
Basically , in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable , and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , it reshuffles , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab , and I managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
They really loved it .
And , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions .
All you have to say is , "Make words" , and they know exactly what to do .
So here's another few people trying it out .
That's our youngest beta tester , down there on the right .
Turns out , all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up .
So to him , they were just blocks .
Now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners .
And this is Felix , actually .
And he can bring new characters into the scene , just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them .
Here , he's bringing the sun out .
Video: The sun is rising .
David Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene .
Video: The orange tractor .
Good job ! Yeah !
DM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact - Video: Woof !
DM: inventing his own narrative .
Video: Hello !
DM: It's an open-ended story , and he gets to decide how it unfolds .
Video: Fly away , cat .
DM: So , the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently , in which Siftables act as sounds like lead , bass and drums .
Each of these has four different variations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want .
And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable .
There are effects that you can control live , like reverb and filter .
You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it .
And then , overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
So let's have a look .
Video: DM: We'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables , arrange them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead .
Now I put a bass line in .
Video: DM: Now I'll put some percussion in .
Video: DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums , so I can control the effect live .
Video: DM: I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other .
Video: DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression .
Video: DM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays .
So I don't have to plan it out in advance , but I can improvise , making it longer or shorter as I go .
And now , finally , I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Siftable , tilted to the left .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
And today , I had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory .
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
Thank you very much .
I look forward to talking with all of you .
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Elizabeth Gilbert muses on the impossible things we expect from artists and geniuses - and shares the radical idea that , instead of the rare person "being" a genius , all of us "have" a genius . It's a funny , personal and surprisingly moving talk .
Elizabeth Gilbert: Your elusive creative genius.
I am a writer .
Writing books is my profession but it's more than that , of course .
It is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
And I don't expect that that's ever going to change .
But , that said , something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work .
And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book , this memoir called "Eat , Pray , Love" which , decidedly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega-sensation , international bestseller thing .
The result of which is that everywhere I go now , people treat me like I'm doomed .
Seriously - doomed , doomed !
Like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , "Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that ?
Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all , ever again" ?
So that's reassuring , you know .
But it would be worse , except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when I was a teenager , when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer , I was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction .
And people would say , "Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success ?
Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you ?
Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure" ?
Like that , you know .
The answer - the short answer to all those questions is , "Yes" .
Yes , I'm afraid of all those things .
And I always have been .
And I'm afraid of many , many more things besides that people can't even guess at , like seaweed and other things that are scary .
But , when it comes to writing , the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately , and wondering about lately , is why ?
You know , is it rational ?
Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
And what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do , you know ?
Like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
"That chemical-engineering block , John , how's it going" ?
It just didn't come up like that , you know ?
But to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives .
We writers , we kind of do have that reputation , and not just writers , but creative people across all genres , it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable .
And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone , of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts , you know .
Norman Mailer , just before he died , last interview , he said , "Every one of my books has killed me a little more" .
An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work .
But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this , because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to anguish .
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
Are you comfortable with that ?
Because you look at it even from an inch away and , you know - I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption .
I think it's odious .
And I also think it's dangerous , and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century .
I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I definitely know that , in my case - in my situation - it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption , particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career .
Which is - you know , like check it out , I'm pretty young , I'm only about 40 years old .
I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book , right ?
I should just put it bluntly , because we're all sort of friends here now - it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
So Jesus , what a thought !
That's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning , and I don't want to go there .
I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love .
And so , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflection , that the way that I have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as I am writing , and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
And , as I've been looking , over the last year , for models for how to do that , I've been sort of looking across time , and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .
And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome .
So stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
But , ancient Greece and ancient Rome - people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , OK ?
People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source , for distant and unknowable reasons .
The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons" .
Socrates , famously , believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar .
The Romans had the same idea , but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius .
Which is great , because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
They believed that a genius was this , sort of magical divine entity , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio , kind of like Dobby the house elf , and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work .
So brilliant - there it is , right there , that distance that I'm talking about - that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work .
And everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
So the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ?
If your work was brilliant , you couldn't take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you .
If your work bombed , not entirely your fault , you know ?
Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .
And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time .
And then the Renaissance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries , and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine .
And it's the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
And for the first time in history , you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius , rather than having a genius .
And I got to tell you , I think that was a huge error .
You know , I think that allowing somebody , one mere person to believe that he or she is like , the vessel , you know , like the font and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknowable , eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human psyche .
It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
It just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance .
And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
Can we do this differently ?
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
Maybe not .
Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech .
And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of , basically , fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff .
I'm not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
But the question that I kind of want to pose is - you know , why not ?
Why not think about it this way ?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process .
A process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something - which is to say basically everyone here - knows does not always behave rationally .
And , in fact , can sometimes feel downright paranormal .
Where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone , who's now in her 90s , but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
And she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
And she felt it coming , because it would shake the earth under her feet .
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , "run like hell" .
And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .
And other times she wouldn't be fast enough , so she'd be running and running , and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it "for another poet" .
And then there were these times - this is the piece I never forgot - she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
So , she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
She would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page .
And in these instances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard that I was like - that's uncanny , that's exactly what my creative process is like .
That's not at all what my creative process is - I'm not the pipeline !
I'm a mule , and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day , and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly .
But even I , in my mulishness , even I have brushed up against that thing , at times .
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify .
And what is that thing ?
And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us sane ?
And for me , the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits , who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment .
And we were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of his life , he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized .
But then he got older , he got calmer , and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles , and this is when it all changed for him .
And he's speeding along , and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , elusive and tantalizing , and he wants it , it's gorgeous , and he longs for it , but he has no way to get it .
He doesn't have a piece of paper , or a pencil , or a tape recorder .
So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like , "I'm going to lose this thing , and I'll be be haunted by this song forever .
I'm not good enough , and I can't do it" .
And instead of panicking , he just stopped .
He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
He just looked up at the sky , and he said , "Excuse me , can you not see that I'm driving" ?
"Do I look like I can write down a song right now ?
If you really want to exist , come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
Go bother Leonard Cohen" .
And his whole work process changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it back where it came from , and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized , tormented thing .
It could be this peculiar , wondrous , bizarre collaboration , kind of conversation between Tom and the strange , external thing that was not quite Tom .
When I heard that story , it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too , and this idea already saved me once .
It saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat , Pray , Love" , and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , the worst book ever written .
Not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
And I started to think I should just dump this project .
But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it .
So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room .
And I said aloud , "Listen you , thing , you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault , right ?
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this , I don't have any more than this .
If you want it to be better , you've got to show up and do your part of the deal .
But if you don't do that , you know what , the hell with it .
I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job .
And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job" .
Because - Because in the end it's like this , OK - centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa , people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until dawn .
They were always magnificent , because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific , right ?
But every once in a while , very rarely , something would happen , and one of these performers would actually become transcendent .
And I know you know what I'm talking about , because I know you've all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
It was like time would stop , and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done , 1 , 000 nights before , but everything would align .
And all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be merely human .
He would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity .
And when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
They would put their hands together and they would start to chant , "Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God" .
That's God , you know .
Curious historical footnote: when the Moors invaded southern Spain , they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from "Allah , Allah , Allah" , to "Olé , olé , olé" , which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances .
In Spain , when a performer has done something impossible and magic , "Allah , olé , olé , Allah , magnificent , bravo" , incomprehensible , there it is - a glimpse of God .
Which is great , because we need that .
But , the tricky bit comes the next morning , for the dancer himself , when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11 a . m . , and he's no longer a glimpse of God .
He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees , and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again .
And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
This is hard .
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished , with somebody else .
And , you know , if we think about it this way , it starts to change everything .
This is how I've started to think , and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published , as the dangerously , frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success .
And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid .
Don't be daunted . Just do your job .
Continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
If your job is to dance , do your dance .
If the divine , cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed , for just one moment through your efforts , then "Olé" !
And if not , do your dance anyhow .
And "Olé" ! to you , nonetheless .
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it .
"Olé" ! to you , nonetheless , just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen: Olé !
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: "Can we create new life out of our digital universe" ? Craig Venter asks . His answer is "yes" - and pretty soon . He walks through his latest research and promises that we'll soon be able to build and boot up a synthetic chromosome .
Craig Venter: On the verge of creating synthetic life.
You know , I've talked about some of these projects before - about the human genome and what that might mean , and discovering new sets of genes .
We're actually starting at a new point: we've been digitizing biology , and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life .
So , we've always been trying to ask big questions .
"What is life" ? is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
We've tried various approaches , paring it down to minimal components .
We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequenced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
Now we're trying to ask , "Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe" ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory , and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
When we look at its metabolic map , it's relatively simple compared to ours - trust me , this is simple - but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
And so we started down the road of: can we synthesize a chromosome ?
Can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before ?
And if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
A chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material .
So , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve .
We started this over 15 years ago .
It took several stages , in fact , starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
But it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA - 30 to 50 letters in length - and it's a degenerate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more errors there are .
So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
And this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of phi X174 .
It's a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the pieces , went through our error correction and had a DNA molecule of about 5 , 000 letters .
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E . coli .
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model .
They laughed more than you guys are . And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to go much larger: we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome - it's over 580 , 000 letters of genetic code - so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
Design is critical , and if you're starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
When we first sequenced this genome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10 , 000 base pairs .
We actually found , on resequencing it , 30 errors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be booted up .
Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together .
We design unique elements into this .
You may have read that we put watermarks in .
Think of this: we have a four-letter genetic code - A , C , G and T .
Triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there's a single letter designation for each of the amino acids .
So we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts .
Initially , all we did was autograph it .
Some people were disappointed there was not poetry .
We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes ; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together .
And we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5 , 000 to 7 , 000 letters , put those together to make 24 , 000-letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72 , 000 .
At each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
We're trying to get to the point of automation .
So , this looks like a basketball playoff .
When we get into these really large pieces over 100 , 000 base pairs , they won't any longer grow readily in E . coli - it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology - and so we turned to other mechanisms .
We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together .
Here's an example of it: there's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation .
You can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart .
Twelve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
We have thousands of organisms that can do this .
These organisms can be totally desiccated ; they can live in a vacuum .
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new aqueous environment .
In fact , NASA has shown a lot of this is out there .
Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; yeast puts them together automatically .
This is not an electron micrograph ; this is just a regular photomicrograph .
It's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope .
These are pictures over about a six-second period .
So , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
This is over 580 , 000 letters of genetic code ; it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
It's over 300 million molecular weight .
If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
Well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? How do we activate this ?
Obviously , with a virus it's pretty simple ; it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
It's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves: you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one , and that's what you've all heard about with cloning .
With bacteria and Archaea , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
We purified a chromosome from one microbial species - roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice - we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome , we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell - and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here .
The new chromosome went into the cell .
In fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
This is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere , adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species .
So , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
There are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one ; the chromosome we put in does .
It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
And with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins changed , the membranes changed ; when we read the genetic code , it's exactly what we had transferred in .
So , this may sound like genomic alchemy , but we can , by moving the software of DNA around , change things quite dramatically .
Now I've argued , this is not genesis ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
And I've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , where there's massive new speciation based on this digital design .
Why do this ?
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
To put it in context for myself: I was born in 1946 .
There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , there'll be four .
We have trouble feeding , providing fresh , clean water , medicines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine .
We use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billion-plus barrels of oil - that's a hundred million barrels a day .
When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it's going to be a huge challenge .
Then of course , there's all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
We now , from our discovery around the world , have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think of these as the design components of the future .
The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
We're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination .
We now have techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesis , to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics .
We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
When you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals , new vaccines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
And it's just standard selection: we can select for viability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
This is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
You know , we don't know necessarily what it'll look like: we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
We're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels .
You've seen recently , corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment .
We have second- and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol .
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock , and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road .
And we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months .
Sunlight and CO2 is one method ...
But in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other methods .
This is an organism we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at boiling-water temperatures .
It takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
We're looking to see if we can take captured CO2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process .
So , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of "What is life" ?
We truly , you know , have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry - Yeah . If you can't do that at TED , where can you ? - become a major source of energy ...
But also , we're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines .
You've seen this year with flu ; we're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
I think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance .
Here's what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria , Archaea and , eventually , eukaryotes .
We're a ways away from improving people: our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . Thank you very much .
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Blaise Aguera y Arcas leads a dazzling demo of Photosynth , software that could transform the way we look at digital images . Using still photos culled from the Web , Photosynth builds breathtaking dreamscapes and lets us navigate them .
Blaise Agüera y Arcas: How PhotoSynth can connect the world's images.
What I'm going to show you first , as quickly as I can , is some foundational work , some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago . This is Seadragon , and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data .
We're looking at many , many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in , panning through it , rearranging it in any way we want .
And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the Library of Congress , and it's in the 300 megapixel range .
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment .
It's also very flexible architecture .
This is an entire book , so this is an example of non-image data .
This is "Bleak House" by Dickens . Every column is a chapter .
To prove to you that it's really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real representation of the text ; it's not a picture .
Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-book .
I wouldn't recommend it .
This is a more realistic case , an issue of The Guardian .
Every large image is the beginning of a section .
And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium .
We've done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian .
We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution - much higher than in an ordinary ad - and we've embedded extra content .
If you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even technical specifications .
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate .
We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other rubbish like that - shouldn't be necessary .
Of course , mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this .
And this one I really won't spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well .
But those are all the roads in the U . S .
Superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image .
So let's pull up , now , something else .
This is actually live on the Web now ; you can go check it out .
This is a project called Photosynth , which marries two different technologies .
One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer-vision research done by Noah Snavely , a graduate student at the University of Washington , co-advised by Steve Seitz at U . W .
And Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research . A very nice collaboration .
And so this is live on the Web . It's powered by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do these sorts of views , where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience .
But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful .
The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots - all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies - all these shots were taken . So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging , and these things have all been related spatially .
I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments .
Some are much more spatial .
I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets - this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer - to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology , It's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments we've put up on the website .
We had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr .
You just type Notre Dame into Flickr , and you get some pictures of guys in T-shirts , and of the campus and so on .
And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model .
And so these are all Flickr images , and they've all been related spatially in this way .
We can just navigate in this very simple way .
You know , I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft .
It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here .
I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras: it's everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs , quite a large number of them , stitched together in this environment .
If I can find some of the sort of weird ones - So many of them are occluded by faces , and so on .
Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs - here we go .
This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly .
We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment .
This is now taking data from everybody - from the entire collective memory , visually , of what the Earth looks like - and link all of that together .
Those photos become linked , and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts .
You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth .
Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work .
And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered .
If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are , then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data , and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space , into that meta-verse , using everybody else's photos , and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way .
And of course , a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on , but from the collective memory .
Thank you so much .
Chris Anderson: Do I understand this right ? What your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together ?
BAA: Yes . What this is really doing is discovering , creating hyperlinks , if you will , between images .
It's doing that based on the content inside the images .
And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have .
Like when you do a web search for images , you type in phrases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
What if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge .
It's a classic network effect .
CA: Truly incredible . Congratulations .
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: With stunning photos and stories , National Geographic Explorer Wade Davis celebrates the extraordinary diversity of the world's indigenous cultures , which are disappearing from the planet at an alarming rate .
Wade Davis: Dreams from endangered cultures.
You know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality.
The consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
We're all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through initiation rites .
We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara - this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago - or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma.
Everest , the goddess mother of the world .
All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
Now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy .
It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .
And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere - and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that - the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity - scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
And the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
When each of you in this room were born , there were 6 , 000 languages spoken on the planet .
Now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
A language is a flash of the human spirit .
It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6 , 000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
They're no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they're already dead .
What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
And yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue .
And I know there's some of you who say , "Well , wouldn't it be better , wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language" ? And I say , "Great , let's make that language Yoruba . Let's make it Cantonese .
Let's make it Kogi" .
And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
And so , what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a brief journey through the ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say "different ways of being" , I really do mean different ways of being .
Take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
Now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called "linguistic exogamy:" you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
And this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
They simply listen and then begin to speak .
Or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives .
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders .
They speared each other .
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
We traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway . But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind .
In the early '80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . And Voodoo is not a black magic cult .
On the contrary , it's a complex metaphysical worldview .
It's interesting .
If I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism , whatever .
There's always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
But , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead .
So , the living give birth to the spirits .
The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
That's why the Voodooists like to say that "You white people go to church and speak about God .
We dance in the temple and become God" .
And because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit - how can you be harmed ?
So you see these astonishing demonstrations: Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
Now , of all the peoples that I've ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia .
Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain .
In a bloodstained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish .
To this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary .
The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years: two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
And for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic - or we might say the ecological - balance .
And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . And the priest steps back.
And says , "You see ? It's really as I've told you .
It is that beautiful . It is yours to protect" .
They call themselves the "elder brothers" and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the "noble savage" , which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
Well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia .
There's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition: the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
Now , what does that mean ?
It means that a young kid from the Andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation .
Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here .
It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .
This is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman's repertoire .
What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . It's made really of two different sources: on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic - to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness - but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family.
Called Psychotria viridis .
This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines , very close to brain serotonin , dimethyltryptamine , 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine .
If you've ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine .
To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . It doesn't create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes - who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s - I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination . But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally.
Because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase .
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO .
Now , the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . So you ask yourself a question .
How , in a flora of 80 , 000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
Well , we use that great euphemism , "trial and error" , which is exposed to be meaningless .
But you ask the Indians , and they say , "The plants talk to us" .
Well , what does that mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , "I thought you knew something about plants .
I mean , don't you know anything" ? And I said , "No" .
Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
Now , that's not going to get you a Ph . D . at Harvard , but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens . Now - the problem - the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn't change .
All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy .
It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . It is power , the crude face of domination .
Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to: whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan - a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak - a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago.
And now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea , where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest - or , in the case of the Yanomami.
It's the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I'm doing a lot of research recently , you'll see it's a crude face of political domination .
You know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people's way of life , is not only not condemned , it's universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
I once travelled 6 , 000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about: 6 , 000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1 . 2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution .
This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama .
That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal .
His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him .
The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor .
The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold .
And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice: do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?
Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
And it's humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for [150 , 000] years .
The Neolithic Revolution - which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus - is only 10 , 000 years ago .
The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
Now , that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10 , 000 different voices .
And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . And there are great moments of optimism .
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements .
This old man's grandfather refused to go .
The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
Now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide .
So , this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
He simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . And as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it .
He skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
Talk about getting by with nothing . And this , in many ways - is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
It's our new homeland . It's called Nunavut .
It's an independent territory . They control all mineral resources .
An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people .
And finally , in the end , I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they're not remote at all .
They're homelands of somebody .
They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
So , what we're trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
We think that polemics - we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . We get 35 million hits on our website every month .
156 nations carry our television channel .
Our magazines are read by millions .
And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology: that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world.
Where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you very much .
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies: freedom of choice . In Schwartz's estimation , choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed , not happier but more dissatisfied .
Barry Schwartz: The paradox of choice.
I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other things you've already heard , and I'll try to make some connections myself , in case you missed them .
But I want to start with what I call the "official dogma" .
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all Western industrial societies .
And the official dogma runs like this: if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens , the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom .
The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , worthwhile , essential to being human .
And because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare , and no one has to decide on our behalf .
The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
The more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more welfare they have .
This , I think , is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it .
And it's also deeply embedded in our lives .
I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
This is my supermarket . Not such a big one .
I want to say just a word about salad dressing .
175 salad dressings in my supermarket , if you don't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings , in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you .
So this is what the supermarket is like .
And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system - speakers , CD player , tape player , tuner , amplifier - and in this one single consumer electronics store , there are that many stereo systems .
We can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
You've got to admit that's a lot of choice .
In other domains - the world of communications .
There was a time , when I was a boy , when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted , as long as it came from Ma Bell .
You rented your phone . You didn't buy it .
One consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
And those days are gone .
We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
These are cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle one - the MP3 player , nose hair trimmer , and crème brûlée torch .
And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet , you can rest assured that one day soon , you will .
And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question .
And do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
The answer is "no" .
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
Health care . It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , "Well , we could do A , or we could do B .
A has these benefits , and these risks .
B has these benefits , and these risks . What do you want to do" ?
And you say , "Doc , what should I do" ?
And the doc says , "A has these benefits and risks , and B has these benefits and risks .
What do you want to do" ?
And you say , "If you were me , Doc , what would you do" ?
And the doc says , "But I'm not you" .
And the result is - we call it "patient autonomy" , which makes it sound like a good thing , but it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something - namely , the doctor - to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions - namely , the patient .
There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can't buy them .
Why do they market to us if we can't buy them ?
The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed .
Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indicate .
We don't inherit an identity ; we get to invent it .
And we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like .
And that means that every day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
With respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
The only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
Nowadays , everything is very much up for grabs .
I teach wonderfully intelligent students , and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to .
And it's not because they're less smart , and it's not because they're less diligent .
It's because they are preoccupied , asking themselves , "Should I get married or not ? Should I get married now ?
Should I get married later ? Should I have kids first , or a career first" ?
All of these are consuming questions .
And they're going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses .
And indeed they should . These are important questions to answer .
Work - we are blessed , as Carl was pointing out , with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet - except the Randolph Hotel .
There is one corner , by the way , that I'm not going to tell anybody about , where the WiFi actually works .
I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it .
So what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn't be working .
We can go to watch our kid play soccer , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our Blackberry on our other hip , and our laptop , presumably , on our laps .
And even if they're all shut off , every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game , we are also asking ourselves , "Should I answer this cell phone call ?
Should I respond to this email ? Should I draft this letter" ?
And even if the answer to the question is "no" , it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been .
So everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle things , life is a matter of choice .
And the world we used to live in looked like this .
That is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
And the world we now live in looks like this . [The Ten Commandments DYI Kit] And the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
And the answer is , "yes" .
We all know what's good about it , so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it .
All of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
One effect , paradoxically , is that it produces paralysis , rather than liberation .
With so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
I'll give you one very dramatic example of this: a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans .
A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard , the gigantic mutual-fund company of about a million employees and about 2 , 000 different workplaces .
And what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered , rate of participation went down two percent .
You offer 50 funds - 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five . Why ?
Because with 50 funds to choose from , it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose , that you'll just put it off until tomorrow .
And then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer .
By not participating , they are passing up as much as 5 , 000 dollars a year from the employer , who would happily match their contribution .
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world look like this .
You really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity , right ?
You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund , or the wrong salad dressing .
So that's one effect . The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
And there are several reasons for this .
One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from , if you buy one , and it's not perfect - and what salad dressing is ? - it's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better . And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made.
Even if it was a good decision .
The more options there are , the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose .
Second , what economists call "opportunity costs" .
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
Well , when there are lots of alternatives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen .
Here's an example . [I can't stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 85th street] Sorry if you're not New Yorkers .
Here's what you're supposed to be thinking .
Here's this couple on the Hamptons .
Very expensive real estate .
Gorgeous beach . Beautiful day . They have it all to themselves .
What could be better ?
"Well , damn it" , this guy is thinking , "It's August . Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away .
I could be parking right in front of my building" .
And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terrific .
And the more options there are to consider , the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs .
Here's another example .
Now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
It makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing , you're choosing not to do other things that may have lots of attractive features , and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive .
Third: escalation of expectations .
This hit me when I went to replace my jeans .
I wear jeans almost all the time .
There was a time when jeans came in one flavor , and you bought them , and they fit like crap , they were incredibly uncomfortable , if you wore them and washed them enough times , they started to feel OK .
I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones , and I said , "I want a pair of jeans . Here's my size" .
And the shopkeeper said , "Do you want slim fit , easy fit , relaxed fit ?
You want button fly or zipper fly ? You want stonewashed or acid-washed ?
Do you want them distressed ?
You want boot cut , tapered , blah blah" . On and on he went .
My jaw dropped . And after I recovered , I said , "I want the kind that used to be the only kind" .
He had no idea what that was , so I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans , and I walked out of the store - truth ! - with the best-fitting jeans I had ever had . I did better .
All this choice made it possible for me to do better .
But - I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
The reason I felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up .
I had very low , no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor .
When they came in 100 flavors , damn it , one of them should've been perfect .
And what I got was good , but it wasn't perfect .
And so I compared what I got to what I expected , and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected .
Adding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be .
And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results , even when they're good results .
Nobody in the world of marketing knows this .
Because if they did , you wouldn't all know what this was about .
The truth is more like this .
[Everything was better back when everything was worse] The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
Nowadays , the world we live in - we affluent , industrialized citizens , with perfection the expectation - the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations , my expectations , have gone through the roof .
The secret to happiness - this is what you all came for - the secret to happiness is low expectations .
I want to say - just a little autobiographical moment - that I actually am married to a wife , and she's really quite wonderful .
I couldn't have done better .
But settling isn't always such a bad thing .
Finally - One consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied , and you ask why , who's responsible , the answer is clear: the world is responsible .
What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available , and you buy one that is disappointing , and you ask why , who's responsible ?
It is equally clear that the answer to the question is "you" .
You could have done better .
With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display , there is no excuse for failure .
And so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they blame themselves .
Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
I believe a significant - not the only , but a significant - contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they're at fault .
And so the net result is that we do better in general , objectively , and we feel worse .
So let me remind you .
This is the official dogma , the one that we all take to be true , and it's all false . It is not true .
There's no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
There's some magical amount . I don't know what it is .
I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare .
Now , as a policy matter - I'm almost done - as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this: what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence .
There are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
Their problem is that they have too little .
So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern , affluent , Western societies .
And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this: Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don't help .
What I'm telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices - it's not simply that they don't help .
They actually hurt .
They actually make us worse off .
If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people's lives be improved , but ours would be improved also , which is what economists call a "Pareto-improving move" .
Income redistribution will make everyone better off - not just poor people - because of how all this excess choice plagues us .
So to conclude . [You can be anything you want to be - no limits] You're supposed to read this cartoon , and , being a sophisticated person , say , "Ah ! What does this fish know ?
You know , nothing is possible in this fishbowl" .
Impoverished imagination , a myopic view of the world - and that's the way I read it at first .
The more I thought about it , however , the more I came to the view that this fish knows something .
Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible , you don't have freedom . You have paralysis .
If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible , you decrease satisfaction .
You increase paralysis , and you decrease satisfaction .
Everybody needs a fishbowl .
This one is almost certainly too limited - perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery , and , I suspect , disaster .
Thank you very much .
Sajay Samuel: How college loans exploit students for profit.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: "Once upon a time in America" , says professor Sajay Samuel , "going to college did not mean graduating with debt" . Today , higher education has become a consumer product - costs have skyrocketed , saddling students with a combined debt of over $1 trillion , while universities and loan companies make massive profits . Samuel proposes a radical solution: link tuition costs to a degree's expected earnings , so that students can make informed decisions about their future , restore their love of learning and contribute to the world in a meaningful way .
Today 40 million Americans are indebted for their passage to the new economy .
Too poor to pay their way through college , they now owe lenders more than one trillion US dollars .
They do find what jobs they can get to pay off a debt that is secured on their person .
In America , even a bankrupt gambler gets a second chance .
But it is nearly impossible for an American to get discharged their student loan debts .
Once upon a time in America , going to college did not mean graduating with debt .
My friend Paul's father graduated from Colorado State University on the GI Bill .
For his generation , higher education was free or almost free , because it was thought of as a public good .
Not anymore .
When Paul also graduated from Colorado State University , he paid for his English degree by working part-time .
30 years ago , higher education tuition was affordable , reasonable , and what debts you accumulated , you paid off by graduation date .
Not anymore .
Paul's daughter followed in his footsteps , but with one difference: when she graduated five years ago , it was with a whopping debt .
Students like Kate have to take on a loan because the cost of higher education has become unaffordable for many if not most American families .
But so what ?
Getting into debt to buy an expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off with the increased income that you earned from it .
But that's where the rubber meets the road .
Even a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 2013 .
So ...
Tuition costs up , public funding down , family incomes diminished , personal incomes weak .
Is it any wonder that more than a quarter of those who must cannot make their student loan payments ?
The worst of times can be the best of times , because certain truths flash up in ways that you can't ignore .
I want to speak of three of them today .
1 . 2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas make it abundantly obvious that higher education is a consumer product you can buy .
All of us talk about education just as the economists do now , as an investment that you make to improve the human stock by training them for work .
As an investment you make to sort and classify people so that employers can hire them more easily .
The U . S . News &amp ; World Report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines .
The language is peppered with barbarisms .
Teachers are called "service providers" , students are called "consumers" .
Sociology and Shakespeare and soccer and science , all of these are "content" .
Student debt is profitable .
Only not on you .
Your debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry .
The two 800-pound gorillas of which - Sallie Mae and Navient - posted last year a combined profit of 1 . 2 billion dollars .
And just like home mortgages , student loans can be bundled and packaged and sliced and diced , and sold on Wall Street .
And colleges and universities that invest in these securitized loans profit twice .
Once from your tuition , and then again from the interest on debt .
With all that money to be made , are we surprised that some in the higher education business have begun to engage in false advertising , in bait and switch ...
In exploiting the very ignorance that they pretend to educate ?
Third: diplomas are a brand .
Many years ago my teacher wrote , "When students are treated as consumers , they're made prisoners of addiction and envy" .
Just as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iPhone , so also people can be sold more and more education .
College is the new high school , we already say that .
But why stop there ?
People can be upsold on certifications and recertifications , master's degrees , doctoral degrees .
Higher education is also marketed as a status object .
Buy a degree , much like you do a Lexus of a Louis Vuitton bag , to distinguish yourself from others .
So you can be the object of envy of others .
Diplomas are a brand .
But these truths are often times hidden by a very noisy sales pitch . There is not a day that goes by "A college degree is absolutely essential to get on that up escalator to a middle-class life" .
And the usual evidence offered is the college premium: a college grad who makes on average 56 percent more than a high school grad .
Let's look at that number more carefully , because on the face of it , it seems to belie the stories we all hear about college grads working as baristas and cashiers .
Of 100 people who enroll in any form of post-secondary education , 45 do not complete it in a timely fashion , for a number of reasons , including financial .
Of the 55 that do graduate , two will remain unemployed , and another 18 are underemployed .
So , college grads earn more than high school grads , but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition and the lost wages while at college ?
Now even economists admit going to college pays off for only those who complete it .
But that's only because high school wages have been cut to the bone , for decades now .
For decades , workers with a high school degree have been denied a fair share of what they have produced .
And had they received as they should have , then going to college would have been a bad investment for many .
College premium ?
I think it's a high school discount .
Two out of three people who enroll are not going to find an adequate job .
And the future , for them , doesn't look particularly promising - in fact , it's downright bleak .
And it is they who are going to suffer the most punishing forms of student debt .
And it is they , curiously and sadly , who are marketed most loudly about this college premium thing .
That's not just cynical marketing , that's cruel .
So what do we do ?
What if students and parents treated higher education as a consumer product ?
Everybody else seems to .
Then , like any other consumer product , you would demand to know what you're paying for .
When you buy medicines , you get a list of side effects .
When you buy a higher educational product , you should have a warning label that allows consumers to choose , make informed choices .
When you buy a car , it tells you how many miles per gallon to expect .
Who knows what to expect from a degree say , in Canadian Studies .
There is such a thing , by the way .
What if there was an app for that ?
One that linked up the cost of a major to the expected income .
Let's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT .
One of you make this .
Discover your reality .
There are three advantages , three benefits to Income-Based Tuition .
Any user can figure out how much money he or she will make from a given college and major .
Such informed users are unlikely to fall victim to the huckster's ploy , to the sales pitch .
But also to choose wisely .
Why would anybody pay more for college than let's say , 15 percent of the additional income they earn ?
There's a second benefit to Income-Based Tuition .
By tying the cost to the income , college administrators would be forced to manage costs better , to find innovative ways to do so .
For instance , all of you students here pay roughly the same tuition for every major .
That is manifestly unfair , and should change .
An engineering student uses more resources and facilities and labs and faculty than a philosophy student .
But the philosophy student , as a consequence , is subsidizing the engineering student .
Who then , by the way , goes on and earns more money .
Why should two people buy the same product , pay the same , but one person receive half or a third of the service .
In fact , college grads , some majors , pay 25 percent of their income servicing their student debt , while others pay five percent .
That kind if inequity would end when majors are priced more correctly .
Now of course , all this data - and one of you is going to do this , right ?
All this data has to be well designed , maybe audited by public accounting firms to avoid statistical lies .
We know about statistics , right ?
But be that as it may , the third and biggest benefit of Income-Based Tuition , is it would free Americans from the fear and the fact of financial ruin because they bought a defective product .
Perhaps , in time , young and old Americans may rediscover , as the gentleman said earlier , their curiosity , their love of learning - begin to study what they love , follow their passion ...
Getting stimulated by their intelligence , follow paths of inquiry that they really want to .
After all , it was Eric and Kevin , two years ago , just exactly these kinds of young men , who prompted me and worked with me , and still do , in the study of indebted students in America .
Thank you for your attention .
Jamila Raqib: The secret to effective nonviolent resistance.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We're not going to end violence by telling people that it's morally wrong , says Jamila Raqib , executive director of the Albert Einstein Institution . Instead , we must find alternative ways to conduct conflict that are equally powerful and effective . Raqib promotes nonviolent resistance to people living under tyranny - and there's a lot more to it than street protests . She shares encouraging examples of creative strategies that have led to change around the world and a message of hope for a future without armed conflict . "The greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence but in making violence obsolete" , Raqib says .
War has been a part of my life since I can remember .
I was born in Afghanistan , just six months after the Soviets invaded , and even though I was too young to understand what was happening , I had a deep sense of the suffering and the fear around me .
Those early experiences had a major impact on how I now think about war and conflict .
I learned that when people have a fundamental issue at stake , for most of them , giving in is not an option .
For these types conflicts - when people's rights are violated , when their countries are occupied , when they're oppressed and humiliated - they need a powerful way to resist and to fight back .
Which means that no matter how destructive and terrible violence is , if people see it as their only choice , they will use it .
Most of us are concerned with the level of violence in the world .
But we're not going to end war by telling people that violence is morally wrong .
Instead , we must offer them a tool that's at least as powerful and as effective as violence .
This is the work I do .
For the past 13 years , I've been teaching people in some of the most difficult situations around the world how they can use nonviolent struggle to conduct conflict .
Most people associate this type of action with Gandhi and Martin Luther King .
But people have been using nonviolent action for thousands of years .
In fact , most of the rights that we have today in this country - as women , as minorities , as workers , as people of different sexual orientations and citizens concerned with the environment - these rights weren't handed to us .
They were won by people who fought for them and who sacrificed for them .
But because we haven't learned from this history , nonviolent struggle as a technique is widely misunderstood .
I met recently with a group of Ethiopian activists , and they told me something that I hear a lot .
They said they'd already tried nonviolent action , and it hadn't worked .
Years ago they held a protest .
The government arrested everyone , and that was the end of that .
The idea that nonviolent struggle is equivalent to street protests is a real problem .
Because although protests can be a great way to show that people want change , on their own , they don't actually create change - at least change that is fundamental .
Powerful opponents are not going to give people what they want just because they asked nicely ...
Or even not so nicely .
Nonviolent struggle works by destroying an opponent , not physically , but by identifying the institutions that an opponent needs to survive , and then denying them those sources of power .
Nonviolent activists can neutralize the military by causing soldiers to defect .
They can disrupt the economy through strikes and boycotts .
And they can challenge government propaganda by creating alternative media .
There are a variety of methods that can be used to do this .
My colleague and mentor , Gene Sharp , has identified 198 methods of nonviolent action .
And protest is only one .
Let me give you a recent example .
Until a few months ago , Guatemala was ruled by corrupt former military officials with ties to organized crime .
People were generally aware of this , but most of them felt powerless to do anything about it - until one group of citizens , just 12 regular people , put out a call on Facebook to their friends to meet in the central plaza , holding signs with a message: "Renuncia YA" - resign already .
To their surprise , 30 , 000 people showed up .
They stayed there for months as protests spread throughout the country .
At one point , the organizers delivered hundreds of eggs to various government buildings with a message: "If you don't have the huevos" - the balls - "to stop corrupt candidates from running for office , you can borrow ours" .
President Molina responded by vowing that he would never step down .
And the activists realized that they couldn't just keep protesting and ask the president to resign .
They needed to leave him no choice .
So they organized a general strike , in which people throughout the country refused to work .
In Guatemala City alone , over 400 businesses and schools shut their doors .
Meanwhile , farmers throughout the country blocked major roads .
Within five days , the president , along with dozens of other government officials , resigned already .
I've been greatly inspired by the creativity and bravery of people using nonviolent action in nearly every country in the world .
For example , recently a group of activists in Uganda released a crate of pigs in the streets .
You can see here that the police are confused about what to do with them .
The pigs were painted the color of the ruling party .
One pig was even wearing a hat , a hat that people recognized .
Activists around the world are getting better at grabbing headlines , but these isolated actions do very little if they're not part of a larger strategy .
A general wouldn't march his troops into battle unless he had a plan to win the war .
Yet this is how most of the world's nonviolent movements operate .
Nonviolent struggle is just as complex as military warfare , if not more .
Its participants must be well-trained and have clear objectives , and its leaders must have a strategy of how to achieve those objectives .
The technique of war has been developed over thousands of years with massive resources and some of our best minds dedicated to understanding and improving how it works .
Meanwhile , nonviolent struggle is rarely systematically studied , and even though the number is growing , there are still only a few dozen people in the world who are teaching it .
This is dangerous , because we now know that our old approaches of dealing with conflict are not adequate for the new challenges that we're facing .
The US government recently admitted that it's in a stalemate in its war against ISIS .
But what most people don't know is that people have stood up to ISIS using nonviolent action .
When ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014 , they announced that they were putting in place a new public school curriculum , based on their own extremist ideology .
But on the first day of school , not a single child showed up .
Parents simply refused to send them .
They told journalists they would rather homeschool their children than to have them brainwashed .
This is an example of just one act of defiance in just one city .
But what if it was coordinated with the dozens of other acts of nonviolent resistance that have taken place against ISIS ?
What if the parents' boycott was part of a larger strategy to identify and cut off the resources that ISIS needs to function ; the skilled labor needed to produce food ; the engineers needed to extract and refine oil ; the media infrastructure and communications networks and transportation systems , and the local businesses that ISIS relies on ?
It may be difficult to imagine defeating ISIS with action that is nonviolent .
But it's time we challenge the way we think about conflict and the choices we have in facing it .
Here's an idea worth spreading: let's learn more about where nonviolent action has worked and how we can make it more powerful , just like we do with other systems and technologies that are constantly being refined to better meet human needs .
It may be that we can improve nonviolent action to a point where it is increasingly used in place of war .
Violence as a tool of conflict could then be abandoned in the same way that bows and arrows were , because we have replaced them with weapons that are more effective .
With human innovation , we can make nonviolent struggle more powerful than the newest and latest technologies of war .
The greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence but in making violence obsolete .
Thank you .
Tristan Harris: How better tech could protect us from distraction.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How often does technology interrupt us from what we really mean to be doing ? At work and at play , we spend a startling amount of time distracted by pings and pop-ups - instead of helping us spend our time well , it often feels like our tech is stealing it away from us . Design thinker Tristan Harris offers thoughtful new ideas for technology that creates more meaningful interaction . He asks: "What does the future of technology look like when you're designing for the deepest human values" ?
What does it mean to spend our time well ?
I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to spend my time .
Probably too much - I probably obsess over it .
My friends think I do .
But I feel like I kind of have to , because these days , it feels like little bits of my time kind of slip away from me , and when that happens , it feels like parts of my life are slipping away .
Specifically , it feels like little bits of my time get slipped away to various things like this , like technology - I check things .
I'll give you an example .
If this email shows up - how many of you have gotten an email like this , right ?
I've been tagged in a photo .
When this appears , I can't help but click on it right now .
Right ? Because , like , what if it's a bad photo ?
So I have to click it right now .
But I'm not just going to click "See photo" , what I'm actually going to do is spend the next 20 minutes .
But the worst part is that I know this is what's going to happen , and even knowing that's what's going to happen doesn't stop me from doing it again the next time .
Or I find myself in a situation like this , where I check my email and I pull down to refresh , But the thing is that 60 seconds later , I'll pull down to refresh again .
Why am I doing this ?
This doesn't make any sense .
But I'll give you a hint why this is happening .
What do you think makes more money in the United States than movies , game parks and baseball combined ?
Slot machines .
How can slot machines make all this money when we play with such small amounts of money ?
We play with coins .
How is this possible ?
Well , the thing is ...
My phone is a slot machine .
Every time I check my phone , I'm playing the slot machine to see , What am I going to get ?
Every time I check my email , I'm playing the slot machine , saying , "What am I going to get" ?
Every time I scroll a news feed , I'm playing the slot machine to see , what am I going to get next ?
And the thing is that , again , knowing exactly how this works - and I'm a designer , I know exactly how the psychology of this works , I know exactly what's going on - but it doesn't leave me with any choice , I still just get sucked into it .
So what are we going to do ?
Because it leaves us with this all-or-nothing relationship with technology , right ?
You're either on , and you're connected and distracted all the time , or you're off , but then you're wondering , am I missing something important ?
In other words , you're either distracted or you have fear of missing out .
Right ?
So we need to restore choice .
We want to have a relationship with technology that gives us back choice about how we spend time with it , and we're going to need help from designers , because knowing this stuff doesn't help .
We're going to need design help .
So what would that look like ?
So let's take an example that we all face: chat - text messaging .
So let's say there's two people .
Nancy's on the left and she's working on a document , and John's on the right .
And John suddenly remembers , "I need to ask Nancy for that document before I forget" .
So when he sends her that message , it blows away her attention .
That's what we're doing all the time , bulldozing each other's attention , left and right .
And there's serious cost to this , because every time we interrupt each other , it takes us about 23 minutes , on average , to refocus our attention .
We actually cycle through two different projects before we come back to the original thing we were doing .
This is Gloria Mark's research combined with Microsoft research , that showed this .
And her research also shows that it actually trains bad habits .
The more interruptions we get externally , it's conditioning and training us to interrupt ourselves .
We actually self-interrupt every three-and-a-half minutes .
This is crazy .
So how do we fix this ?
Because Nancy and John are in this all-or-nothing relationship .
Nancy might want to disconnect , but then she'd be worried: What if I'm missing something important ?
Design can fix this problem .
Let's say you have Nancy again on the left , John on the right .
And John remembers , "I need to send Nancy that document" .
Except this time , Nancy can mark that she's focused .
Let's say she drags a slider and says , "I want to be focused for 30 minutes" , so - bam - she's focused .
Now when John wants to message her , he can get the thought off of his mind - because he has a need , he has this thought , and he needs to dump it out before he forgets .
Except this time , it holds the messages so that Nancy can still focus , but John can get the thought off of his mind .
But this only works if one last thing is true , which is that Nancy needs to know that if something is truly important , John can still interrupt .
But instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions , we're now only creating conscious interruptions , So we're doing two things here .
We're creating a new choice for both Nancy and John , But there's a second , subtle thing we're doing here , too .
And it's that we're changing the question we're answering .
Instead of the goal of chat being: "Let's design it so it's easy to send a message" - that's the goal of chat , it should be really easy to send a message to someone - we change the goal to something deeper and a human value , which is: "Let's create the highest possible quality communication in a relationship between two people .
So we upgraded the goal .
Now , do designers actually care about this ?
Do we want to have conversations about what these deeper human goals are ?
Well , I'll tell you one story .
A little over a year ago , I got to help organize a meeting between some of technology's leading designers and Thich Nhat Hanh .
Thich Nhat Hanh is an international spokesperson for mindfulness meditation .
And it was the most amazing meeting .
You have to imagine - picture a room - on one side of the room , you have a bunch of tech geeks ; on the other side of the room , you have a bunch of long brown robes , shaved heads , Buddhist monks .
And the questions were about the deepest human values , like what does the future of technology look like when you're designing for the deepest questions and the deepest human values ?
And our conversation centered on listening more deeply to what those values might be .
He joked in our conversation that what if , instead of a spell check , you had a compassion check , meaning , you might highlight a word that might be accidentally abrasive - perceived as abrasive by someone else .
So does this kind of conversation happen in the real world , not just in these design meetings ?
Well , the answer is yes , and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing .
If you didn't know , Couchsurfing is a website that matches people who are looking for a place to stay with a free couch , from someone who's trying to offer it .
So , great service - what would their design goal be ?
What are you designing for if you work at Couchsurfing ?
Well , you would think it's to match guests with hosts .
Right ?
That's a pretty good goal .
But that would kind of be like our goal with messaging before , where we're just trying to deliver a message .
So what's the deeper , human goal ?
Well , they set their goal as the need to create lasting , positive experiences and relationships between people who've never met before .
And the most amazing thing about this was in 2007 , they introduced a way to measure this , which is incredible .
I'll tell you how it works .
For every design goal you have , you have to have a corresponding measurement to know how you're doing - a way of measuring success . So what they do is , let's say you take two people who meet up , and they take the number of days those two people spent together , and then they estimate how many hours were in those days - how many hours did those two people spend together ?
And then after they spend that time together , they ask both of them: How positive was your experience ?
Did you have a good experience with this person that you met ?
And they subtract from those positive hours the amount of time people spent on the website , because that's a cost to people's lives .
Why should we value that as success ?
And what you were left with is something they refer to as "net orchestrated conviviality" , or , really , just a net "Good Times" created .
The net hours that would have never existed , had Couchsurfing not existed .
Can you imagine how inspiring it would be to come to work every day and measure your success in the actual net new contribution of hours in people's lives that are positive , that would have never existed if you didn't do what you were about to do at work today ?
Can you imagine a whole world that worked this way ?
Can you imagine a social network that - let's say you care about cooking , and it measured its success in terms of cooking nights organized and the cooking articles that you were glad you read , and subtracted from that the articles you weren't glad you read or the time you spent scrolling that you didn't like ?
Imagine a professional social network that , instead of measuring its success in terms of connections created or messages sent , instead measured its success in terms of the job offers that people got that they were excited to get .
And subtracted the amount of time people spent on the website .
Or imagine dating services , like maybe Tinder or something , where instead of measuring the number of swipes left and right people did , which is how they measure success today , instead measured the deep , romantic , fulfilling connections people created .
Whatever that was for them , by the way .
But can you imagine a whole world that worked this way , that was helping you spend your time well ?
Now to do this you also need a new system , because you're probably thinking , today's Internet economy - today's economy in general - is measured in time spent .
The more users you have , the more usage you have , the more time people spend , that's how we measure success .
But we've solved this problem before .
We solved it with organic , when we said we need to value things a different way .
We said this is a different kind of food .
So we can't compare it just based on price ; this is a different category of food .
We solved it with Leed Certification , where we said this is a different kind of building that stood for different values of environmental sustainability .
What if we had something like that for technology ?
What if we had something whose entire purpose and goal was to help create net new positive contributions to human life ?
And what if we could value it a different way , so it would actually work ?
Imagine you gave this different premium shelf space on app stores .
Imagine you had web browsers that helped route you to these kinds of design products .
Can you imagine how exciting it would be to live and create that world ?
We can create this world today .
Company leaders , all you have to do - only you can prioritize a new metric , which is your metric for net positive contribution to human life .
And have an honest conversation about that .
Maybe you're not doing so well to start with , but let's start that conversation .
Designers , you can redefine success ; you can redefine design .
Arguably , you have more power than many people in your organization to create the choices that all of us live by .
Maybe like in medicine , where we have a Hippocratic oath to recognize the responsibility and this higher value that we have to treat patients .
What if designers had something like that , in terms of this new kind of design ?
And users , for all of us - we can demand technology that works this way .
Now it may seem hard , but McDonald's didn't have salads until the consumer demand was there .
Walmart didn't have organic food until the consumer demand was there .
We have to demand this new kind of technology .
And we can do that .
And doing that would amount to shifting from a world that's driven and run entirely on time spent , to world that's driven by time well spent .
I want to live in this world , and I want this conversation to happen .
Let's start that conversation now .
Thank you .
Seema Bansal: How to fix a broken education system ... without any more money.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Seema Bansal forged a path to public education reform for 15 , 000 schools in Haryana , India , by setting an ambitious goal: by 2020 , 80 percent of children should have grade-level knowledge . She's looking to meet this goal by seeking reforms that will work in every school without additional resources . Bansal and her team have found success using creative , straightforward techniques such as communicating with teachers using SMS group chats , and they have already measurably improved learning and engagement in Haryana's schools .
So we all have our own biases .
For example , some of us tend to think that it's very difficult to transform failing government systems .
When we think of government systems , we tend to think that they're archaic , set in their ways , and perhaps , the leadership is just too bureaucratic to be able to change things .
Well , today , I want to challenge that theory .
I want to tell you a story of a very large government system that has not only put itself on the path of reform but has also shown fairly spectacular results in less than three years .
This is what a classroom in a public school in India looks like .
There are 1 million such schools in India .
And even for me , who's lived in India all her life , walking into one of these schools is fairly heartbreaking .
By the time kids are 11 , 50 percent of them have fallen so far behind in their education that they have no hope to recover .
11-year-olds cannot do simple addition , they cannot construct a grammatically correct sentence .
These are things that you and I would expect an 8-year-old to be able to do .
By the time kids are 13 or 14 , they tend to drop out of schools .
In India , public schools not only offer free education - they offer free textbooks , free workbooks , free meals , sometimes even cash scholarships .
And yet , 40 percent of the parents today are choosing to pull their children out of public schools and pay out of their pockets to put them in private schools .
As a comparison , in a far richer country , the US , that number is only 10 percent .
That's a huge statement on how broken the Indian public education system is .
So it was with that background that I got a call in the summer of 2013 from an absolutely brilliant lady called Surina Rajan .
She was , at that time , the head of the Department of School Education in a state called Haryana in India .
So she said to us , "Look , I've been heading this department for the last two years .
I've tried a number of things , and nothing seems to work .
Can you possibly help" ?
Let me describe Haryana a little bit to you .
Haryana is a state which has 30 million people .
It has 15 , 000 public schools and 2 million plus children in those public schools .
So basically , with that phone call , I promised to help a state and system which was as large as that of Peru or Canada transform itself .
As I started this project , I was very painfully aware of two things .
One , that I had never done anything like this before .
And two , many others had , perhaps without too much success .
As my colleagues and I looked across the country and across the world , we couldn't find another example that we could just pick up and replicate in Haryana .
We knew that we had to craft our own journey .
But anyway , we jumped right in and as we jumped in , all sorts of ideas started flying at us .
People said , "Let's change the way we recruit teachers , let's hire new principals and train them and send them on international learning tours , let's put technology inside classrooms" .
By the end of week one , we had 50 ideas on the table , all amazing , all sounded right .
There was no way we were going to be able to implement 50 things .
So I said , "Hang on , stop .
Let's first at least decide what is it we're trying to achieve" .
So with a lot of push and pull and debate , Haryana set itself a goal which said: by 2020 , we want 80 percent of our children to be at grade-level knowledge .
Now the specifics of the goal don't matter here , but what matters is how specific the goal is .
Because it really allowed us to take all those ideas which were being thrown at us and say which ones we were going to implement .
Does this idea support this goal ? If yes , let's keep it .
But if it doesn't or we're not sure , then let's put it aside .
As simple as it sounds , having a very specific goal right up front has really allowed us to be very sharp and focused in our transformation journey .
And looking back over the last two and a half years , that has been a huge positive for us .
So we had the goal , and now we needed to figure out what are the issues , what is broken .
Before we went into schools , a lot of people told us that education quality is poor because either the teachers are lazy , they don't come into schools , or they're incapable , they actually don't know how to teach .
Well , when we went inside schools , we found something completely different .
On most days , most teachers were actually inside schools .
And when you spoke with them , you realized they were perfectly capable of teaching elementary classes .
But they were not teaching .
I went to a school where the teachers were getting the construction of a classroom and a toilet supervised .
I went to another school where two of the teachers had gone to a nearby bank branch to deposit scholarship money into kids' accounts .
At lunchtime , most teachers were spending all of their time getting the midday meal cooking , supervised and served to the students .
So we asked the teachers , "What's going on , why are you not teaching" ?
And they said , "This is what's expected of us .
When a supervisor comes to visit us , these are exactly the things that he checks .
Has the toilet been made , has the meal been served .
When my principal goes to a meeting at headquarters , these are exactly the things which are discussed" .
You see , what had happened was , over the last two decades , India had been fighting the challenge of access , having enough schools , and enrollment , bringing children into the schools .
So the government launched a whole host of programs to address these challenges , and the teachers became the implicit executors of these programs .
Not explicitly , but implicitly .
And now , what was actually needed was not to actually train teachers further or to monitor their attendance but to tell them that what is most important is for them to go back inside classrooms and teach .
They needed to be monitored and measured and awarded on the quality of teaching and not on all sorts of other things .
So as we went through the education system , as we delved into it deeper , we found a few such core root causes which were determining , which were shaping how people behaved in the system .
And we realized that unless we change those specific things , we could do a number of other things .
We could train , we could put technology into schools , but the system wouldn't change .
And addressing these non-obvious core issues became a key part of the program .
So , we had the goal and we had the issues , and now we needed to figure out what the solutions were .
We obviously did not want to recreate the wheel , so we said , "Let's look around and see what we can find" .
And we found these beautiful , small pilot experiments all over the country and all over the world .
Small things being done by NGOs , being done by foundations .
But what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled .
All of them were limited to 50 , 100 or 500 schools .
And here , we were looking for a solution for 15 , 000 schools .
So we looked into why , if these things actually work , why don't they actually scale ?
What happens is that when a typical NGO comes in , they not only bring in their expertise but they also bring in additional resources .
So they might bring in money , they might bring in people , they might bring in technology .
And in the 50 or 100 schools that they actually operate in , those additional resources actually create a difference .
But now imagine that the head of this NGO goes to the head of the School Education Department and says , "Hey , now let's do this for 15 , 000 schools" .
Where is that guy or girl going to find the money to actually scale this up to 15 , 000 schools ?
He doesn't have the additional money , he doesn't have the resources .
And hence , innovations don't scale .
So right at the beginning of the project , what we said was , "Whatever we have to do has to be scalable , it has to work in all 15 , 000 schools" .
And hence , it has to work within the existing budgets and resources that the state actually has .
Much easier said than done .
I think this was definitely the point in time when my team hated me .
We spent a lot of long hours in office , in cafés , sometimes even in bars , scratching out heads and saying , "Where are the solutions , how are we going to solve this problem" ?
In the end , I think we did find solutions to many of the issues .
I'll give you an example .
In the context of effective learning , one of the things people talk about is hands-on learning .
Children shouldn't memorize things from books , they should do activities , and that's a more effective way to learn .
Which basically means giving students things like beads , learning rods , abacuses .
But we did not have the budgets to give that to 15 , 000 schools , 2 million children .
We needed another solution .
We couldn't think of anything .
One day , one of our team members went to a school and saw a teacher pick up sticks and stones from the garden outside and take them into the classroom and give them to the students .
That was a huge eureka moment for us .
So what happens now in the textbooks in Haryana is that after every concept , we have a little box which are instructions for the teachers which say , "To teach this concept , here's an activity that you can do .
And by the way , in order to actually do this activity , here are things that you can use from your immediate environment , whether it be the garden outside or the classroom inside , which can be used as learning aids for kids" .
And we see teachers all over Haryana using lots of innovative things to be able to teach students .
So in this way , whatever we designed , we were actually able to implement it across all 15 , 000 schools from day one .
Now , this brings me to my last point .
How do you implement something across 15 , 000 schools and 100 , 000 teachers ?
The department used to have a process which is very interesting .
I like to call it "The Chain of Hope" .
They would write a letter from the headquarters and send it to the next level , which was the district offices .
They would hope that in each of these district offices , an officer would get the letter , would open it , read it and then forward it to the next level , which was the block offices .
And then you would hope that at the block office , somebody else got the letter , opened it , read it and forwarded it eventually to the 15 , 000 principals .
And then one would hope that the principals got the letter , received it , understood it and started implementing it .
It was a little bit ridiculous .
Now , we knew technology was the answer , but we also knew that most of these schools don't have a computer or email .
However , what the teachers do have are smartphones .
They're constantly on SMS , on Facebook and on WhatsApp .
So what now happens in Haryana is , all principals and teachers are divided into hundreds of WhatsApp groups and anytime something needs to be communicated , it's just posted across all WhatsApp groups .
It spreads like wildfire .
You can immediately check who has received it , who has read it .
Teachers can ask clarification questions instantaneously .
And what's interesting is , it's not just the headquarters who are answering these questions .
Another teacher from a completely different part of the state will stand up and answer the question .
Everybody's acting as everybody's peer group , and things are getting implemented .
So today , when you go to a school in Haryana , things look different .
The teachers are back inside classrooms , they're teaching .
Often with innovative techniques .
When a supervisor comes to visit the classroom , he or she not only checks the construction of the toilet but also what is the quality of teaching .
Once a quarter , all students across the state are assessed on their learning outcomes and schools which are doing well are rewarded .
And schools which are not doing so well find themselves having difficult conversations .
Of course , they also get additional support to be able to do better in the future .
In the context of education , it's very difficult to see results quickly .
When people talk about systemic , large-scale change , they talk about periods of 7 years and 10 years .
But not in Haryana .
In the last one year , there have been three independent studies , all measuring student learning outcomes , which indicate that something fundamental , something unique is happening in Haryana .
Learning levels of children have stopped declining , and they have started going up .
Haryana is one of the few states in the country which is showing an improvement , and certainly the one that is showing the fastest rate of improvement .
These are still early signs , there's a long way to go , but this gives us a lot of hope for the future .
I recently went to a school , and as I was leaving , I ran into a lady , her name was Parvati , she was the mother of a child , and she was smiling .
And I said , "Why are you smiling , what's going on" ?
And she said , "I don't know what's going on , but what I do know is that my children are learning , they're having fun , and for the time being , I'll stop my search for a private school to send them to" .
So I go back to where I started: Can government systems transform ?
I certainly believe so .
I think if you give them the right levers , they can move mountains .
Thank you .
Chris Milk: The birth of virtual reality as an art form.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Chris Milk uses innovative technologies to make personal , interactive , human stories . Accompanied by Joshua Roman on cello and McKenzie Stubbert on piano , Milk traces his relationship to music and art - from the first moment he remembers putting on headphones to his current work creating breakthrough virtual reality projects . VR is the last medium for storytelling , he says , because it closes the gap between audience and storyteller . To illustrate , he brought the TED audience together in the world's largest collective VR experience . Join them and take part in this interactive talk by getting a Google Cardboard and downloading the experience at with . in/TED .
When I was a kid , I experienced something so powerful , I spent the rest of my life searching for it , and in all the wrong places .
What I experienced wasn't virtual reality .
It was music .
And this is where the story begins .
That's me , listening to the Beatles' "White Album" .
And the look on my face is the feeling that I've been searching for ever since .
Music goes straight to the emotional vein , into your bloodstream and right into your heart .
It deepens every experience .
Fellas ?
This is the amazing McKenzie Stubbert and Joshua Roman .
Music - Music makes everything have more emotional resonance .
Let's see how it does for this talk .
The right piece of music at the right time fuses with us on a cellular level .
When I hear that one song from that one summer with that one girl , I'm instantly transported back there again .
Hey , Stacey .
Here's a part of the story , though , where I got a little greedy .
I thought if I added more layers on top of the music , I could make the feelings even more powerful .
So I got into directing music videos .
This is what they looked like .
That's my brother , Jeff .
Sorry about this , Jeff .
Here's me , just so we're even .
Incredible moves .
Should've been a dancer .
These experiments grew , and in time , started to look more like this .
In both , I'm searching for the same thing , though , to capture that lightning in a bottle .
Except , I'm not .
Adding moving pictures over the music added narrative dimension , yes , but never quite equated the power that just raw music had for me on its own .
This is not a great thing to realize when you've devoted your life and professional career to becoming a music video director .
I kept asking myself , did I take the wrong path ?
So I started thinking: if I could involve you , the audience , more , I might be able to make you feel something more as well .
So Aaron Koblin and I began auditioning new technologies that could put more of you inside of the work , like your childhood home in "The Wilderness Downtown" , your hand-drawn portraits , in "The Johnny Cash Project" , and your interactive dreams in "3 Dreams of Black" .
We were pushing beyond the screen , trying to connect more deeply to people's hearts and imaginations .
But it wasn't quite enough .
It still didn't have the raw experiential power of pure music for me .
So I started chasing a new technology that I only had read about in science fiction .
And after years of searching , I found a prototype .
It was a project from Nonny de la Peña in Mark Bolas's lab in USC .
And when I tried it , I knew I'd found it .
I could taste the lightning .
It was called virtual reality .
This was it five years ago when I ran into it .
This is what it looks like now .
I quickly started building things in this new medium , and through that process we realized something: that VR is going to play an incredibly important role in the history of mediums .
In fact , it's going to be the last one .
I mean this because it's the first medium that actually makes the jump from our internalization of an author's expression of an experience , to our experiencing it firsthand .
You look confused . I'll explain . Don't worry .
If we go back to the origins of mediums , by all best guesses , it starts around a fire , with a good story .
Our clan leader is telling us about how he hunted the woolly mammoth on the tundra that day .
We hear his words and translate them into our own internal truths .
The same thing happens when we look at the cave painting version of the story , the book about the mammoth hunt , the play , the radio broadcast , the television show or the movie .
All of these mediums require what we call "suspension of disbelief" , because there's a translation gap between the reality of the story and our consciousness interpreting the story into our reality .
I'm using the word "consciousness" as a feeling of reality that we get from our senses experiencing the world around us .
Virtual reality bridges that gap .
Now , you are on the tundra hunting with the clan leader .
Or you are the clan leader .
Or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth .
So here's what special about VR .
In all other mediums , your consciousness interprets the medium .
In VR , your consciousness is the medium .
So the potential for VR is enormous .
But where are we now ?
What is the current state of the art ?
Well , we are here .
We are the equivalent of year one of cinema .
This is the Lumière Brothers film that allegedly sent a theater full of people running for their lives as they thought a train was coming toward them .
Similar to this early stage of this medium , in VR , we also have to move past the spectacle and into the storytelling .
It took this medium decades to figure out its preferred language of storytelling , in the form of a feature film .
In VR today , we're more learning grammar than writing language .
We've made 15 films in the last year at our VR company , Vrse , and we've learned a few things .
We found that we have a unique , direct path into your senses , your emotions , even your body .
So let me show you some things .
For the purpose of this demo , we're going to take every direction that you could possibly look , and stretch it into this giant rectangle .
OK , here we go .
So , first: camera movement is tricky in VR .
Done wrong , it can actually make you sick .
We found if you move the camera at a constant speed in a straight line , you can actually get away with it , though .
The first day in film school , they told me you have to learn every single rule before you can break one .
We have not learned every single rule .
We've barely learned any at all , but we're already trying to break them to see what kind of creative things we can accomplish .
In this shot here , where we're moving up off the ground , I added acceleration .
I did that because I wanted to give you a physical sensation of moving up off the ground .
In VR , I can give that to you .
Not surprisingly , music matters a lot in this medium as well .
It guides us how to feel .
In this project we made with the New York Times , Zach Richter and our friend , JR , we take you up in a helicopter , and even though you're flying 2 , 000 feet above Manhattan , you don't feel afraid .
You feel triumphant for JR's character .
The music guides you there .
Contrary to popular belief , there is composition in virtual reality , but it's completely different than in film , where you have a rectangular frame .
Composition is now where your consciousness exists and how the world moves around you .
In this film , "Waves of Grace" , which was a collaboration between Vrse , the United Nations , Gabo Arora , and Imraan Ismail , we also see the changing role of the close-up in virtual reality .
A close-up in VR means you're actually close up to someone .
It brings that character inside of your personal space , a space that we'd usually reserve for the people that we love .
And you feel an emotional closeness to the character because of what you feel to be a physical closeness .
Directing VR is not like directing for the rectangle .
It's more of a choreography of the viewer's attention .
One tool we can use to guide your attention is called "spatialized sound" .
I can put a sound anywhere in front of you , to left or right , even behind you , and when you turn your head , the sound will rotate accordingly .
So I can use that to direct your attention to where I want you to see .
Next time you hear someone singing over your shoulder , it might be Bono .
VR makes us feel like we are part of something .
For most of human history , we lived in small family units .
We started in caves , then moved to clans and tribes , then villages and towns , and now we're all global citizens .
But I believe that we are still hardwired to care the most about the things that are local to us .
And VR makes anywhere and anyone feel local .
That's why it works as an empathy machine .
Our film "Clouds Over Sidra" takes you to a Syrian refugee camp , and instead of watching a story about people over there , it's now a story about us here .
But where do we go from here ?
The tricky thing is that with all previous mediums , the format is fixed at its birth .
Film has been a sequence of rectangles , from Muybridge and his horses to now .
The format has never changed .
But VR as a format , as a medium , isn't complete yet .
It's not using physical celluloid or paper or TV signals .
It actually employs what we use to make sense of the world .
We're using your senses as the paints on the canvas , but only two right now .
Eventually , we can see if we will have all of our human senses employed , and we will have agency to live the story in any path we choose .
And we call it virtual reality right now , but what happens when we move past simulated realities ?
What do we call it then ?
What if instead of verbally telling you about a dream , I could let you live inside that dream ?
What if instead of just experiencing visiting some reality on Earth , you could surf gravitational waves on the edge of a black hole , or create galaxies from scratch , or communicate with each other not using words but using our raw thoughts ?
That's not a virtual reality anymore .
And honestly I don't know what that's called .
But I hope you see where we're going .
But here I am , intellectualizing a medium I'm saying is experiential .
So let's experience it .
In your hands , you hopefully hold a piece of cardboard .
Let's open the flap .
Tap on the power button to unlock the phone .
For the people watching at home , we're going to put up a card right now to show you how to download this experience on your phone yourself , and even get a Google cardboard of your own to try it with .
We played in cardboard boxes as kids , and as adults , I'm hoping we can all find a little bit of that lightning by sticking our head in one again . You're about to participate in the largest collective VR viewing in history .
And in that classic old-timey style of yesteryear , we're all going to watch something at the exact same time , together .
Let's hope it works .
What's the countdown look like ? I can't see .
Audience: ... 15 , 14 , 13 , 12 , 11 , 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 Audience: JR: Let me tell you how I shot the cover of the New York Times Magazine , "Walking New York" .
I just got strapped on outside the helicopter , and I had to be perfectly vertical so I could grab it .
And when I was perfectly above - you know , with the wind , we had to redo it a few times - then I kept shooting .
Woman's voice: Dear Lord , protect us from evil , for you are the Lord , the light .
You who gave us life took it away .
Let your will be done .
Please bring peace to the many who have lost loved ones .
Help us to live again .
Child's voice: There are more kids in Zaatari than adults right now .
Sometimes I think we are the ones in charge .
Chris Milk: How was it ?
That was a cheap way of getting you to do a standing ovation .
I just made you all stand . I knew you'd applaud at the end .
I believe that everyone on Earth needs to experience what you just experienced .
That way we can collectively start to shape this , not as a tech platform but as a humanity platform .
And to that end , in November of last year , the New York Times and Vrse made a VR project called "The Displaced" .
It launched with one million Google Cardboards sent out to every Sunday subscriber with their newspaper .
But a funny thing happened that Sunday morning .
A lot of people got them that were not the intended recipients on the mailing label .
And we started seeing this all over Instagram .
Look familiar ?
Music led me on a path of searching for what seemed like the unattainable for a very long time .
Now , millions of kids just had the same formative experience in their childhood that I had in mine .
Only I think this one surpasses it .
Let's see where this leads them .
Thank you .
Keolu Fox: Why genetic research must be more diverse.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Ninety-six percent of genome studies are based on people of European descent . The rest of the world is virtually unrepresented - and this is dangerous , says geneticist and TED Fellow Keolu Fox , because we react to drugs differently based on our genetic makeup . Fox is working to democratize genome sequencing , specifically by advocating for indigenous populations to get involved in research , with the goal of eliminating health disparities . "The research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture" , he says , "or die trying" .
As a little Hawaiian , my mom and auntie always told me stories about Kalaupapa - the Hawaiian leper colony surrounded by the highest sea cliffs in the world - and Father Damien , the Belgian missionary who gave his life for the Hawaiian community .
As a young nurse , my aunt trained the nuns caring for the remaining lepers almost a 100 years after Father Damien died of leprosy .
I remember stories she told about traveling down switchback cliff paths on a mule , while my uncle played her favorite hula songs on the ukulele all the way down to Kalaupapa .
You see , as a youngster , I was always curious about a few things .
First was why a Belgian missionary chose to live in complete isolation in Kalaupapa , knowing he would inevitably contract leprosy from the community of people he sought to help .
And secondly , where did the leprosy bacteria come from ?
And why were Kānaka Maoli , the indigenous people of Hawaii , so susceptible to developing leprosy , or "mai Pake" ?
This got my curious about what makes us unique as Hawaiians - namely , our genetic makeup .
But it wasn't until high school , through the Human Genome Project , that I realized I wasn't alone in trying to connect our unique genetic ancestry to our potential health , wellness and illness .
You see , the 2 . 7 billion-dollar project promised an era of predictive and preventative medicine based on our unique genetic makeup .
So to me it always seemed obvious that in order to achieve this dream , we would need to sequence a diverse cohort of people to obtain the full spectrum of human genetic variation on the planet .
That's why 10 years later , it continues to shock me , knowing that 96 percent of genome studies associating common genetic variation with specific diseases have focused exclusively on individuals of European ancestry .
Now you don't need a PhD to see that that leaves four percent for the rest of diversity .
And in my own searching , I've discovered that far less than one percent have actually focused on indigenous communities , like myself .
So that begs the question: Who is the Human Genome Project actually for ?
Just like we have different colored eyes and hair , we metabolize drugs differently based on the variation in our genomes .
So how many of you would be shocked to learn that 95 percent of clinical trials have also exclusively featured individuals of European ancestry ?
This bias and systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people in both clinical trials and genome studies is partially the result of a history of distrust .
For example , in 1989 , researchers from Arizona State University obtained blood samples from Arizona's Havasupai tribe , promising to alleviate the burden of type 2 diabetes that was plaguing their community , only to turn around and use those exact same samples - without the Havasupai's consent - to study rates of schizophrenia , inbreeding , and challenge the Havasupai's origin story .
When the Havasupai found out , they sued successfully for $700 , 000 , and they banned ASU from conducting research on their reservation .
This culminated in a sort of domino effect with local tribes in the Southwest - including the Navajo Nation , one of the largest tribes in the country - putting a moratorium on genetic research .
Now despite this history of distrust , I still believe that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research .
And if we don't do something soon , the gap in health disparities is going to continue to widen .
Hawaii , for example , has the longest life expectancy on average of any state in the US , yet native Hawaiians like myself die a full decade before our non-native counterparts , because we have some of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes , obesity , and the number one and number two killers in the US: cardiovascular disease and cancer .
So how do we ensure the populations of people that need genome sequencing the most are not the last to benefit ?
My vision is to make genetic research more native , to indigenize genome sequencing technology .
Traditionally , genomes are sequenced in laboratories .
Here's an image of your classic genome sequencer .
It's huge .
It's the size of a refrigerator .
There's this obvious physical limitation .
But what if you could sequence genomes on the fly ?
What if you could fit a genome sequencer in your pocket ?
This nanopore-based sequencer is one 10 , 000th the size of your traditional genome sequencer .
It doesn't have the same physical limitations , in that it's not tethered to a lab bench with extraneous cords , large vats of chemicals or computer monitors .
It allows us to de-black box genome sequencing technology development in a way that's immersive and collaborative , activating and empowering indigenous communities ... as citizen scientists .
100 years later in Kalaupapa , we now have the technology to sequence leprosy bacteria in real time , using mobile genome sequencers , remote access to the Internet and cloud computation .
But only if that's what Hawaiian people want .
In our space , on our terms .
IndiGenomics is about science for the people by the people .
We'll be starting with a tribal consultation resource , focused on educating indigenous communities on the potential use and misuse of genetic information .
Eventually we'd like to have our own IndiGenomics research institute to conduct our own experiments and educate the next generation of indigenous scientists .
In the end , indigenous people need to be partners in and not subjects of genetic research .
And for those on the outside , just as Father Damien did , the research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture or die trying .
Mahalo .
Elise Roy: When we design for disability , we all benefit.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: "I believe that losing my hearing was one of the greatest gifts I've ever received" , says Elise Roy . As a disability rights lawyer and design thinker , she knows that being Deaf gives her a unique way of experiencing and reframing the world - a perspective that could solve some of our largest problems . As she says: "When we design for disability first , you often stumble upon solutions that are better than those when we design for the norm" .
Of laughing with my friends . I'll never forget the sound of my mother's voice right before I fell asleep .
And I'll never forget the comforting sound of water trickling down a stream .
Imagine my fear , pure fear , when , at the age of 10 , I was told I was going to lose my hearing .
And over the next five years , it progressed until I was classified as profoundly deaf .
But I believe that losing my hearing was one of the greatest gifts I've ever received .
You see , I get to experience the world in a unique way .
And I believe that these unique experiences that people with disabilities have is what's going to help us make and design a better world for everyone - both for people with and without disabilities .
I used to be a disability rights lawyer , and I spent a lot of my time focused on enforcing the law , ensuring that accommodations were made .
And then I had to quickly learn international policy , because I was asked to work on the UN Convention that protects people with disabilities .
As the leader of the NGO there , I spent most of my energy trying to convince people about the capabilities of people with disabilities .
But somewhere along the way , and after many career transitions that my parents weren't so happy about - I stumbled upon a solution that I believe may be an even more powerful tool to solve some of the world's greatest problems , disability or not .
And that tool is called design thinking .
Design thinking is a process for innovation and problem solving .
There are five steps .
The first is defining the problem and understanding its constraints .
The second is observing people in real-life situations and empathizing with them .
Third , throwing out hundreds of ideas - the more the better , the wilder the better .
Fourth , prototyping: gathering whatever you can , whatever you can find , to mimic your solution , to test it and to refine it .
And finally , implementation: ensuring that the solution you came up with is sustainable .
Warren Berger says that design thinking teaches us to look sideways , to reframe , to refine , to experiment and , probably most importantly , ask those stupid questions .
Design thinkers believe that everyone is creative .
They believe in bringing people from multiple disciplines together , because they want to share multiple perspectives and bring them together and ultimately merge them to form something new .
Design thinking is such a successful and versatile tool that it has been applied in almost every industry .
I saw the potential that it had for the issues I faced , so I decided to go back to school and get my master's in social design .
This looks at how to use design to create positive change in the world .
While I was there , I fell in love with woodworking . But what I quickly realized was that I was missing out on something .
As you're working with a tool , right before it's about to kick back at you - which means the piece or the tool jumps back at you - it makes a sound .
And I couldn't hear this sound .
So I decided , why not try and solve it ?
My solution was a pair of safety glasses that were engineered to visually alert the user to pitch changes in the tool , before the human ear could pick it up .
Why hadn't tool designers thought of this before ?
Two reasons: one , I was a beginner .
I wasn't weighed down by expertise or conventional wisdom .
The second is: I was Deaf .
My unique experience of the world helped inform my solution .
And as I went on , I kept running into more and more solutions that were originally made for people with disabilities , and that ended up being picked up , embraced and loved by the mainstream , disability or not .
This is an OXO potato peeler .
It was originally designed for people with arthritis , but it was so comfortable , everybody loved it .
Text messaging: that was originally designed for people who are Deaf .
And as you know , everybody loves that , too .
I started thinking: What if we changed our mindset ?
What if we started designing for disability first - not the norm ?
As you see , when we design for disability first , we often stumble upon solutions that are not only inclusive , but also are often better than when we design for the norm .
And this excites me , because this means that the energy it takes to accommodate someone with a disability can be leveraged , molded and played with as a force for creativity and innovation .
This moves us from the mindset of trying to change the hearts and the deficiency mindset of tolerance , to becoming an alchemist , the type of magician that this world so desperately needs to solve some of its greatest problems .
Now , I also believe that people with disabilities have great potential to be designers within this design-thinking process .
Without knowing it , from a very early age , I've been a design thinker , fine-tuning my skills .
Design thinkers are , by nature , problem solvers .
So imagine listening to a conversation and only understanding 50 percent of what is said .
You can't ask them to repeat every single word .
They would just get frustrated with you .
So without even realizing it , my solution was to take the muffled sound I heard , that was the beat , and turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips I read .
Years later , someone commented that my writing had a rhythm to it .
Well , this is because I experience conversations as rhythms .
I also became really , really good at failing .
Quite literally .
My first semester in Spanish , I got a D .
But what I learned was that when I picked myself up and changed a few things around , eventually , I succeeded .
Similarly , design thinking encourages people to fail and fail often , because eventually , you will succeed .
Very few great innovations in this world have come from someone succeeding on the first try .
I also experienced this lesson in sports .
I'll never forget my coach saying to my mom , "If she just didn't have her hearing loss , she would be on the national team" .
But what my coach , and what I didn't even know at the time , was that my hearing loss actually helped me excel at sports .
You see , when you lose your hearing , not only do you adapt your behavior , but you also adapt your physical senses .
One example of this is that my visual attention span increased .
Imagine a soccer player , coming down the left flank .
Imagine being goalkeeper , like I was , and the ball is coming down the left flank .
A person with normal hearing would have the visual perspective of this .
I had the benefit of a spectrum this wide .
So I picked up the players over here , that were moving about and coming down the field .
And I picked them up quicker , so that if the ball was passed , I could reposition myself and be ready for that shot .
So as you can see , I've been a design thinker for nearly all my life .
My observation skills have been honed so that I pick up on things that others would never pick up on .
My constant need to adapt has made me a great ideator and problem solver .
And I've often had to do this within limitations and constraints .
This is something that designers also have to deal with frequently .
My work most recently took me to Haiti .
Design thinkers often seek out extreme situations , because that often informs some of their best designs .
And Haiti - it was like a perfect storm .
I lived and worked with 300 Deaf individuals that were relocated after the 2010 earthquake .
But five and a half years later , there still was no electricity ; there still was no safe drinking water ; there were still no job opportunities ; there was still rampant crime , and it went unpunished .
International aid organizations came one by one .
But they came with pre-determined solutions .
They didn't come ready to observe and to adapt based on the community's needs .
One organization gave them goats and chickens .
But they didn't realize that there was so much hunger in that community , that when the Deaf went to sleep at night and couldn't hear , people broke into their yards and their homes and stole these chickens and goats , and eventually they were all gone .
Now , if that organization had taken the time to observe Deaf people , to observe the community , they would have realized their problem and perhaps they would have come up with a solution , something like a solar light , lighting up a secure pen to put them in at night to ensure their safety .
You don't have to be a design thinker to insert the ideas I've shared with you today .
You are creative .
You are a designer - everyone is .
Let people like me help you .
Let people with disabilities help you look sideways , and in the process , solve some of the greatest problems .
That's it . Thank you .
Brian Little: Who are you , really ? The puzzle of personality.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What makes you , you ? Psychologists like to talk about our traits , or defined characteristics that make us who we are . But Brian Little is more interested in moments when we transcend those traits - sometimes because our culture demands it of us , and sometimes because we demand it of ourselves . Join Little as he dissects the surprising differences between introverts and extroverts and explains why your personality may be more malleable than you think .
What an intriguing group of individuals you are ...
To a psychologist .
I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other .
And I think it's fair to say , already , that there are 47 people in this audience , at this moment , displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today .
And I thought you might like to know who you are .
But instead of pointing at you , which would be gratuitous and intrusive , I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories , in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself .
I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology , which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum , from neurons to narratives .
And what we try to do , in our own way , is to make sense of how each of us - each of you - is , in certain respects , like all other people , like some other people and like no other person .
Now , already you may be saying of yourself , "I'm not intriguing .
I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere" .
Or you may say of yourself , "I am intriguing , even if I am regarded by most people as a great , thundering twit" .
But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent "twitiness" that makes me , as a psychologist , really fascinated by you .
So let me explain why this is so .
One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology , and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed , and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people .
They spell out the acronym OCEAN .
So , "O" stands for "open to experience" , versus those who are more closed .
"C" stands for "conscientiousness" , in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life .
"E" - "extroversion" , in contrast to more introverted people .
"A" - "agreeable individuals" , in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable .
And "N" - "neurotic individuals" , in contrast to those who are more stable .
All of these dimensions have implications for our well-being , for how our life goes .
And so we know that , for example , openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success , but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and , occasionally , odd .
The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines , to persevering , as well as having some passion .
Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people .
Extroverts , for example , I find intriguing .
With my classes , I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow .
Did you know that ?
Already , some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow .
But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried , but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them .
Those are the extroverts .
Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion , because it's consequential and it's intriguing , and it helps us understand what I call our three natures .
First , our biogenic nature - our neurophysiology .
Second , our sociogenic or second nature , which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives .
And third , what makes you individually you - idiosyncratic - what I call your "idiogenic" nature .
Let me explain .
One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation .
And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises , parties and social events here at TED - you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core .
They all gather together .
And I've seen you .
The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor , where they are able to reduce stimulation - and may be misconstrued as being antisocial , but you're not necessarily antisocial .
It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation .
Sometimes it's an internal stimulant , from your body .
Caffeine , for example , works much better with extroverts than it does introverts .
When extroverts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say , "I really need a cup of coffee" , they're not kidding - they really do .
Introverts do not do as well , particularly if the tasks they're engaged in - and they've had some coffee - if those tasks are speeded , and if they're quantitative , introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative .
But it's a misconstrual .
So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be , and that takes me to my next point .
I should say , before getting to this , something about sexual intercourse , although I may not have time .
And so , if you would like me to - yes , you would ? OK .
There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act , as broken down by male , female ; introvert , extrovert .
So I ask you: How many times per minute - oh , I'm sorry , that was a rat study - How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act ?
3 . 0 .
Extroverted men ? More or less ?
Yes , more .
5 . 5 - almost twice as much .
Introverted women: 3 . 1 .
Extroverted women ?
Frankly , speaking as an introverted male , which I will explain later - they are heroic .
7 . 5 .
They not only handle all the male extroverts , they pick up a few introverts as well .
We communicate differently , extroverts and introverts .
Extroverts , when they interact , want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness .
They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication .
They like to have a lot of eye contact , or mutual gaze .
We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody .
So when an extrovert meets a Charles , it rapidly becomes "Charlie" , and then "Chuck" , and then "Chuckles Baby" .
Whereas for introverts , it remains "Charles" , until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to .
We speak differently .
Extroverts prefer black-and-white , concrete , simple language .
Introverts prefer - and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine - we speak differently .
We prefer contextually complex , contingent , weasel-word sentences - More or less .
As it were .
Not to put too fine a point upon it - like that .
When we talk , we sometimes talk past each other .
I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be .
First , his name is Tom .
Mine isn't .
Secondly , he's six foot five . I have a tendency not to be .
And thirdly , he's as extroverted a person as you could find .
I am seriously introverted .
I overload so much , I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening .
We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael .
And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt .
So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me , "What do you make of Michael" ? Well , I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute .
He spoke in classic "extrovert-ese" .
And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said , which is actually pretty accurate .
I said , "Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for" .
Tom rolled his eyes and he said , "Brian , that's what I said: he's an asshole" !
Now , as an introvert , I might gently allude to certain "assholic" qualities in this man's behavior , but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word .
But the extrovert says , "If he walks like one , if he talks like one , I call him one" .
And we go past each other .
Now is this something that we should be heedful of ?
Of course . It's important that we know this .
Is that all we are ?
Are we just a bunch of traits ?
No , we're not .
Remember , you're like some other people and like no other person .
How about that idiosyncratic you ?
As Elizabeth or as George , you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism .
But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior , or Georgian of yours , that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits ?
That make us love you ?
Not just because you're a certain type of person .
I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes .
I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes .
So what is it that makes us different ?
It's the doings that we have in our life - the personal projects .
You have a personal project right now , but nobody may know it here .
It relates to your kid - you've been back three times to the hospital , and they still don't know what's wrong .
Or it could be your mom .
And you'd been acting out of character .
These are free traits .
You're very agreeable , but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital , to get something for your mom or your child .
What are these free traits ?
They're where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives .
And they are what matters .
Don't ask people what type you are ; ask them , "What are your core projects in your life" ?
And we enact those free traits .
I'm an introvert , but I have a core project , which is to profess .
I'm a professor .
And I adore my students , and I adore my field .
And I can't wait to tell them about what's new , what's exciting , what I can't wait to tell them about .
And so I act in an extroverted way , because at eight in the morning , the students need a little bit of humor , a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study .
But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character .
Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves .
I find , for example , after a period of pseudo-extroverted behavior , I need to repair somewhere on my own .
As Susan Cain said in her "Quiet" book , in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard , I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts .
I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle , trying to avoid overstimulation .
And a real extrovert came in beside me - not right in my cubicle , but in the next cubicle over - and I could hear various evacuatory noises , which we hate - even our own , that's why we flush during as well as after .
And then I heard this gravelly voice saying , "Hey , is that Dr . Little" ?
If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months , it's talking on the john .
That's where I'm going now .
Don't follow me .
Thank you .
Tom Hulme: What can we learn from shortcuts ?
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How do you build a product people really want ? Allow consumers to be a part of the process . "Empathy for what your customers want is probably the biggest leading indicator of business success" , says designer Tom Hulme . In this short talk , Hulme lays out three insightful examples of the intersection of design and user experience , where people have developed their own desire paths out of necessity . Once you know how to spot them , you'll start noticing them everywhere .
When we're designing new products , services or businesses , the only time you'll know if they're any good , if the designs are good , is to see how they're used in the real world , in context .
I'm reminded of that every time I walk past Highbury Fields in north London .
It's absolutely beautiful .
There's a big open green space .
There's Georgian buildings around the side .
But then there's this mud trap that cuts across the middle .
People clearly don't want to walk all the way around the edge .
Instead , they want to take the shortcut , and that shortcut is self-reinforcing .
Now , this shortcut is called a desire path , and it's often the path of least resistance .
I find them fascinating , because they're often the point where design and user experience diverge .
Now at this point , I should apologize , because you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere .
But today , I'm going to pick three I find interesting and share what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services .
The first is in the capital city of Brazil - Brasilia .
And it reminds me that sometimes , you have to just focus on designing for a real need at low friction .
Now , Brasilia is fascinating .
It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s .
It was the golden age of flying , so he laid it out like a plane , as you can see there .
Slightly worryingly , he put most of the important government buildings in the cockpit .
But if you zoom in , in the very center of Brasilia , just where the point is there , you see it's littered with desire paths .
They're absolutely everywhere .
Now , they thought that they had future-proofed this design .
They thought in the future we wouldn't need to walk anywhere - we'd be able to drive - so there was little need for walkways or pavements .
But as you can see , there's a real need .
These are very dangerous desire paths .
If we just pick one , in the middle , you can see it crosses 15 lanes of traffic .
It won't surprise you guys that Brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate of your average US city .
People are resourceful .
They'll always find the low-friction route to save money , save time .
Not all these desire paths are dangerous , I was reminded flying here when I was in Heathrow .
Many of us get frustrated when we're confronted with the obligatory walk through duty-free .
It was amazing to me how many people refused to take the long , meandering path to the left , and just cut through to the right , cut through the desire path .
The question that's interesting is: What do designers think when they see our behavior here ?
Do they think we're stupid ?
Do they think we're lazy ?
Or do they accept that this is the only truth ?
This is their product .
We're effectively co-designing their product .
So our job is to design for real needs at low friction , because if you don't , the customer will , anyway .
The second desire path I wanted to share is at the University of California .
And it reminds me that sometimes the best way to come up with a great design is just to launch it .
Now , university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths .
I think it's because students are always late and they're pretty smart .
So they're dashing to lectures . They'll always find the shortcut .
And the designers here knew that .
So they built the buildings and then they waited a few months for the paths to form .
They then paved them .
Incredibly smart approach .
In fact , often , just launching the straw man of a service can teach you what people really want .
For example , Ayr Muir in Boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant .
But where should it be ?
What should the menu be ?
He launched a service , in this case a food truck , and he changed the location each day .
He'd write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker to figure out what people wanted .
He now has a chain of restaurants .
So it can be incredibly efficient to launch something to spot the desire paths .
The third and final desire path I wanted to share with you is the UNIH .
It reminds me that the world's in flux , and we have to respond to those changes .
So as you'll guess , this is a hospital .
I've marked for you on the left the Oncology Department .
The patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right .
This was a patient-centered organization , so they laid on cars for their patients .
But what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars .
They were too nauseous , so they'd walk back to their hotels .
This desire path that you see diagonally , formed .
The patients even called it "The Chemo Trail" .
Now , when the hospital saw this originally , they tried to lay turf back over it , ignore it .
But after a while , they realized it was an important need they were meeting for their patients , so they paved it .
And I think our job is often to pave these emerging desire paths .
If we look back at the one in North London again , that desire path hasn't always been there .
The reason it sprung up is people were traveling to the mighty Arsenal Football Club stadium on game days , from the Underground station you see on the bottom right .
So you see the desire path .
If we just wind the clock back a few years , when the stadium was being constructed , there is no desire path .
So our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging , and , where appropriate , pave them , as someone did here .
Someone installed a barrier , people started walking across and round the bottom as you see , and they paved it .
But I think this is a wonderful reminder as well , that , actually , the world is in flux . It's constantly changing , because if you look at the top of this image , there's another desire path forming .
So these three desire paths remind me we need to design for real human needs .
I think empathy for what your customers want is probably the biggest leading indicator of business success .
Design for real needs and design them in low friction , because if you don't offer them in low friction , someone else will , often the customer .
Secondly , often the best way to learn what people really want is to launch your service .
The answer is rarely inside the building .
Get out there and see what people really want .
And finally , in part because of technology , the world is incredibly flux at the moment .
It's changing constantly .
These desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever .
Our job is to pick the appropriate ones and pave over them .
Thank you very much .
Wanda Diaz Merced: How a blind astronomer found a way to hear the stars.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Wanda Diaz Merced studies the light emitted by gamma-ray bursts , the most energetic events in the universe . When she lost her sight and was left without a way to do her science , she had a revelatory insight: the light curves she could no longer see could be translated into sound . Through sonification , she regained mastery over her work , and now she's advocating for a more inclusive scientific community . "Science is for everyone" , she says . "It has to be available to everyone , because we are all natural explorers" .
Once there was a star .
Like everything else , she was born ; grew to be around 30 times the mass of our sun and lived for a very long time .
Exactly how long , people cannot really tell .
Just like everything in life , she reached the end of her regular star days when her heart , the core of her life , exhausted its fuel .
But that was no end .
She transformed into a supernova , and in the process releasing a tremendous amount of energy , outshining the rest of the galaxy and emitting , in one second , the same amount of energy our sun will release in 10 days .
And she evolved into another role in our galaxy .
Supernova explosions are very extreme .
But the ones that emit gamma rays are even more extreme .
In the process of becoming a supernova , the interior of the star collapses under its own weight and it starts rotating ever faster , like an ice skater when pulling their arms in close to their body .
In that way , it starts rotating very fast and it increases , powerfully , its magnetic field .
The matter around the star is dragged around , and some energy from that rotation is transferred to that matter and the magnetic field is increased even further .
In that way , our star had extra energy to outshine the rest of the galaxy in brightness and gamma ray emission .
My star , the one in my story , became what is known as a magnetar .
And just for your information , the magnetic field of a magnetar is 1 , 000 trillion times the magnetic field of Earth .
The most energetic events ever measured by astronomers carry the name gamma-ray bursts because we observe them as bursts most or explosions , most strongly measured as gamma-ray light .
Our star , like the one in our story that became a magnetar , is detected as a gamma-ray burst during the most energetic portion of the explosion .
Yet , even though gamma-ray bursts are the strongest events ever measured by astronomers , we cannot see them with our naked eye .
We depend , we rely on other methods in order to study this gamma-ray light .
We cannot see them with our naked eye .
We can only see an itty bitty , tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we call visible light .
And beyond that , we rely on other methods .
Yet as astronomers , we study a wider range of light and we depend on other methods to do that .
On the screen , it may look like this .
You're seeing a plot .
That is a light curve .
It's a plot of intensity of light over time .
It is a gamma-ray light curve .
Sighted astronomers depend on this kind of plot in order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time .
On the left , you will be seeing the light intensity without a burst , and on the right , you will be seeing the light intensity with the burst .
Early during my career , I could also see this kind of plot .
But then , I lost my sight .
I completely lost my sight because of extended illness , and with it , I lost the opportunity to see this plot and the opportunity to do my physics .
It was a very strong transition for me in many ways .
And professionally , it left me without a way to do my science .
I longed to access and scrutinize this energetic light and figure out the astrophysical cause .
I wanted to experience the spacious wonder , the excitement , the joy produced by the detection of such a titanic celestial event .
I thought long and hard about it , when I suddenly realized that all a light curve is , is a table of numbers converted into a visual plot .
So along with my collaborators , we worked really hard and we translated the numbers into sound .
I achieved access to the data , and today I'm able to do physics at the level of the best astronomer , using sound .
And what people have been able to do , mainly visually , for hundreds of years , now I do it using sound .
Listening to this gamma-ray burst that you're seeing on the - Thank you .
Listening to this burst that you're seeing on the screen brought something to the ear beyond the obvious burst .
Now I'm going to play the burst for you .
It's not music , it's sound .
This is scientific data converted into sound , and it's mapped in pitch .
So listening to this brought something to the ear besides the obvious burst .
When I examine the very strong low-frequency regions , or bass line - I'm zooming into the bass line now .
We noted resonances characteristic of electrically charged gasses like the solar wind .
And I want you to hear what I heard .
You will hear it as a very fast decrease in volume .
And because you're sighted , I'm giving you a red line indicating what intensity of light is being converted into sound .
The is frogs at home , don't pay attention to that .
I think you heard it , right ?
So what we found is that the bursts last long enough in order to support wave resonances , which are things caused by exchanges of energy between particles that may have been excited , that depend on the volume .
You may remember that I said that the matter around the star is dragged around ?
It transmits power with frequency and field distribution determined by the dimensions .
You may remember that we were talking about a super-massive star that became a very strong magnetic field magnetar .
If this is the case , then outflows from the exploding star may be associated with this gamma-ray burst .
What does that mean ?
That star formation may be a very important part of these supernova explosions .
Listening to this very gamma-ray burst brought us to the notion that the use of sound as an adjunctive visual display may also support sighted astronomers in the search for more information in the data .
Simultaneously , I worked on analyzing measurements from other telescopes , and my experiments demonstrated that when you use sound as an adjunctive visual display , astronomers can find more information in this now more accessible data set .
This ability to transform data into sound gives astronomy a tremendous power of transformation .
And the fact that a field that is so visual may be improved in order to include anyone with interest in understanding what lies in the heavens is a spirit-lifter .
When I lost my sight , I noticed that I didn't have access to the same amount and quality of information a sighted astronomer had .
It was not until we innovated with the sonification process that I regained the hope to be a productive member of the field that I had worked so hard to be part of .
Yet , information access is not the only area in astronomy where this is important .
The situation is systemic and scientific fields are not keeping up .
The body is something changeable - anyone may develop a disability at any point .
Let's think about , for example , scientists that are already at the top of their careers .
What happens to them if they develop a disability ?
Will they feel excommunicated as I did ?
Information access empowers us to flourish .
It gives us equal opportunities to display our talents and choose what we want to do with our lives , based on interest and not based on potential barriers .
When we give people the opportunity to succeed without limits , that will lead to personal fulfillment and prospering life .
And I think that the use of sound in astronomy is helping us to achieve that and to contribute to science .
While other countries told me that the study of perception techniques in order to study astronomy data is not relevant to astronomy because there are no blind astronomers in the field , South Africa said , "We want people with disabilities to contribute to the field" .
Right now , I'm working at the South African Astronomical Observatory , at the Office of Astronomy for Development .
There , we are working on sonification techniques and analysis methods to impact the students of the Athlone School for the Blind .
These students will be learning radio astronomy , and they will be learning the sonification methods in order to study astronomical events like huge ejections of energy from the sun , known as coronal mass ejections .
What we learn with these students - these students have multiple disabilities and coping strategies that will be accommodated - what we learn with these students will directly impact the way things are being done at the professional level .
I humbly call this development .
And this is happening right now .
I think that science is for everyone .
It belongs to the people , and it has to be available to everyone , because we are all natural explorers .
I think that if we limit people with disabilities from participating in science , we'll sever our links with history and with society .
I dream of a level scientific playing field , where people encourage respect and respect each other , where people exchange strategies and discover together .
If people with disabilities are allowed into the scientific field , an explosion , a huge titanic burst of knowledge will take place , I am sure .
That is the titanic burst .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Prosanta Chakrabarty: Clues to prehistoric times , found in blind cavefish.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: TED Fellow Prosanta Chakrabarty explores hidden parts of the world in search of new species of cave-dwelling fish . These subterranean creatures have developed fascinating adaptations , and they provide biological insights into blindness as well as geological clues about how the continents broke apart million of years ago . Contemplate deep time in this short talk .
Ichthyology , the study of fishes .
It looks like a big , boring word , but it's actually quite exciting , because ichthyology is the only "ology" with "YOLO" in it .
Now , to the cool kids in the audience , you already know , YOLO stands for "you only live once" , and because I only have one life , I'm going to spend it doing what I always dreamt of doing: seeing the hidden wonders of the world and discovering new species .
And that's what I get to do .
Now , in recent years , I really focused on caves for finding new species .
And it turns out , there's lots of new cavefish species out there .
You just have to know where to look , and to maybe be a little thin .
Now , cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology .
They can tell me how the landmasses around them have changed and moved by being stuck in these little holes , and they can tell me about the evolution of sight , by being blind .
Now , fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours .
All vertebrates do , and each time a fish species starts to adapt to this dark , cold , cave environment , over many , many generations , they lose their eyes and their eyesight until the end up like an eyeless cavefish like this one here .
Now , each cavefish species has evolved in a slightly different way , and each one has a unique geological and biological story to tell us , and that's why it's so exciting when we find a new species .
So this is a new species we described , from southern Indiana .
We named it Amblyopsis hoosieri , the Hoosier cavefish .
Its closest relatives are cavefishes in Kentucky , in the Mammoth Cave system .
And they start to diverge when the Ohio River split them a few million years ago .
And in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness .
There's this gene called rhodopsin that's super-critical for sight .
We have it , and these species have it too , except one species has lost all function in that gene , and the other one maintains it .
So this sets up this beautiful natural experiment where we can look at the genes behind our vision , and at the very roots of how we can see .
But the genes in these cavefishes can also tell us about deep geological time , maybe no more so than in this species here .
This is a new species we described from Madagascar that we named Typhleotris mararybe .
That means "big sickness" in Malagasy , for how sick we got trying to collect this species .
Now , believe it or not , swimming around sinkholes full of dead things and cave full of bat poop isn't the smartest thing you could be doing with your life , but YOLO .
Now , I love this species despite the fact that it tried to kill us , and that's because this species in Madagascar , its closest relatives are 6 , 000 kilometers away , cavefishes in Australia .
Now , there's no way a three-inch-long freshwater cavefish can swim across the Indian Ocean , so what we found when we compared the DNA of these species is that they've been separated for more than 100 million years , or about the time that the southern continents were last together .
So in fact , these species didn't move at all .
It's the continents that moved them .
And so they give us , through their DNA , this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient geological events .
Now , this species here is so new I'm not even allowed to tell you its name yet , but I can tell you it's a new species from Mexico , and it's probably already extinct .
It's probably extinct because the only known cave system it's from was destroyed when a dam was built nearby .
Unfortunately for cavefishes , their groundwater habitat is also our main source of drinking water .
Now , we actually don't know this species' closest relative , yet .
It doesn't appear to be anything else in Mexico , so maybe it's something in Cuba , or Florida , or India .
But whatever it is , it might tell us something new about the geology of the Caribbean , or the biology of how to better diagnose certain types of blindness .
But I hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too .
And I'm going to spend my one life as an ichthyologist trying to discover and save these humble little blind cavefishes that can tell us so much about the geology of the planet and the biology of how we see .
Thank you .
Julia Galef: Why you think you're right - even if you're wrong.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Perspective is everything , especially when it comes to examining your beliefs . Are you a soldier , prone to defending your viewpoint at all costs - or a scout , spurred by curiosity ? Julia Galef examines the motivations behind these two mindsets and how they shape the way we interpret information , interweaved with a compelling history lesson from 19th-century France . When your steadfast opinions are tested , Galef asks: "What do you most yearn for ? Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can" ?
So I'd like you to imagine for a moment that you're a soldier in the heat of battle .
Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier or a medieval archer or maybe you're a Zulu warrior .
Regardless of your time and place , there are some things that are constant .
Your adrenaline is elevated , and your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes , reflexes rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side and to defeat the enemy .
So now , I'd like you to imagine playing a very different role , that of the scout .
The scout's job is not to attack or defend .
The scout's job is to understand .
The scout is the one going out , mapping the terrain , identifying potential obstacles .
And the scout may hope to learn that , say , there's a bridge in a convenient location across a river .
But above all , the scout wants to know what's really there , as accurately as possible .
And in a real , actual army , both the soldier and the scout are essential .
But you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset - a metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas in our daily lives .
What I'm going to argue today is that having good judgment , making accurate predictions , making good decisions , is mostly about which mindset you're in .
To illustrate these mindsets in action , I'm going to take you back to 19th-century France , where this innocuous-looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history .
It was discovered in 1894 by officers in the French general staff .
It was torn up in a wastepaper basket , but when they pieced it back together , they discovered that someone in their ranks had been selling military secrets to Germany .
So they launched a big investigation , and their suspicions quickly converged on this man , Alfred Dreyfus .
He had a sterling record , no past history of wrongdoing , no motive as far as they could tell .
But Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer at that rank in the army , and unfortunately at this time , the French Army was highly anti-Semitic .
They compared Dreyfus's handwriting to that on the memo and concluded that it was a match , even though outside professional handwriting experts were much less confident in the similarity , but never mind that .
They went and searched Dreyfus's apartment , looking for any signs of espionage .
They went through his files , and they didn't find anything .
This just convinced them more that Dreyfus was not only guilty , but sneaky as well , because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it .
Next , they went and looked through his personal history for any incriminating details .
They talked to his teachers , they found that he had studied foreign languages in school , which clearly showed a desire to conspire with foreign governments later in life .
His teachers also said that Dreyfus was known for having a good memory , which was highly suspicious , right ?
You know , because a spy has to remember a lot of things .
So the case went to trial , and Dreyfus was found guilty .
Afterwards , they took him out into this public square and ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform and broke his sword in two .
This was called the Degradation of Dreyfus .
And they sentenced him to life imprisonment on the aptly named Devil's Island , which is this barren rock off the coast of South America .
So there he went , and there he spent his days alone , writing letters and letters to the French government begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence .
But for the most part , France considered the matter closed .
One thing that's really interesting to me about the Dreyfus Affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that Dreyfus was guilty .
I mean , you might even assume that they were setting him up , that they were intentionally framing him .
But historians don't think that's what happened .
As far as we can tell , the officers genuinely believed that the case against Dreyfus was strong .
Which makes you wonder: What does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man ?
Well , this is a case of what scientists call "motivated reasoning" .
It's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations , our desires and fears , shape the way we interpret information .
Some information , some ideas , feel like our allies .
We want them to win . We want to defend them .
And other information or ideas are the enemy , and we want to shoot them down .
So this is why I call motivated reasoning , "soldier mindset" .
Probably most of you have never persecuted a French-Jewish officer for high treason , I assume , but maybe you've followed sports or politics , so you might have noticed that when the referee judges that your team committed a foul , you're highly motivated to find reasons why he's wrong .
But if he judges that the other team committed a foul - awesome !
That's a good call , let's not examine it too closely .
Or , maybe you've read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy , like capital punishment .
And , as researchers have demonstrated , if you support capital punishment and the study shows that it's not effective , then you're highly motivated to find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed .
But if it shows that capital punishment works , it's a good study .
And vice versa: if you don't support capital punishment , same thing .
Our judgment is strongly influenced , unconsciously , by which side we want to win .
And this is ubiquitous .
This shapes how we think about our health , our relationships , how we decide how to vote , what we consider fair or ethical .
What's most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier mindset , is how unconscious it is .
We can think we're being objective and fair-minded and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man .
However , fortunately for Dreyfus , his story is not over .
This is Colonel Picquart .
He's another high-ranking officer in the French Army , and like most people , he assumed Dreyfus was guilty .
Also like most people in the army , he was at least casually anti-Semitic .
But at a certain point , Picquart began to suspect: "What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus" ?
What happened was , he had discovered evidence that the spying for Germany had continued , even after Dreyfus was in prison .
And he had also discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo , much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting .
So he brought these discoveries to his superiors , but to his dismay , they either didn't care or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings , like , "Well , all you've really shown , Picquart , is that there's another spy who learned how to mimic Dreyfus's handwriting , and he picked up the torch of spying after Dreyfus left .
But Dreyfus is still guilty" .
Eventually , Picquart managed to get Dreyfus exonerated .
But it took him 10 years , and for part of that time , he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army .
A lot of people feel like Picquart can't really be the hero of this story because he was an anti-Semite and that's bad , which I agree with .
But personally , for me , the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic actually makes his actions more admirable , because he had the same prejudices , the same reasons to be biased as his fellow officers , but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it trumped all of that .
So to me , Picquart is a poster child for what I call "scout mindset" .
It's the drive not to make one idea win or another lose , but just to see what's really there as honestly and accurately as you can , even if it's not pretty or convenient or pleasant .
This mindset is what I'm personally passionate about .
And I've spent the last few years examining and trying to figure out what causes scout mindset .
Why are some people , sometimes at least , able to cut through their own prejudices and biases and motivations and just try to see the facts and the evidence as objectively as they can ?
And the answer is emotional .
So , just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like defensiveness or tribalism , scout mindset is , too .
It's just rooted in different emotions .
For example , scouts are curious .
They're more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new information or an itch to solve a puzzle .
They're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations .
Scouts also have different values .
They're more likely to say they think it's virtuous to test your own beliefs , and they're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak . And above all , scouts are grounded , which means their self-worth as a person isn't tied to how right or wrong they are about any particular topic .
So they can believe that capital punishment works .
If studies come out showing that it doesn't , they can say , "Huh . Looks like I might be wrong . Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid" .
This cluster of traits is what researchers have found - and I've also found anecdotally - predicts good judgment .
And the key takeaway I want to leave you with about those traits is that they're primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know .
In fact , they don't correlate very much with IQ at all .
They're about how you feel .
There's a quote that I keep coming back to , by Saint-Exupéry .
He's the author of "The Little Prince" .
He said , "If you want to build a ship , don't drum up your men to collect wood and give orders and distribute the work .
Instead , teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea" .
In other words , I claim , if we really want to improve our judgment as individuals and as societies , what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric or probability or economics , even though those things are quite valuable .
But what we most need to use those principles well is scout mindset .
We need to change the way we feel .
We need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something .
We need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs .
So the question I want to leave you with is: What do you most yearn for ?
Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs ?
Or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can ?
Thank you .
John Legend: "Redemption Song".
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: John Legend is on a mission to transform America's criminal justice system . Through his Free America campaign , he's encouraging rehabilitation and healing in our prisons , jails and detention centers - and giving hope to those who want to create a better life after serving their time . With a spoken-word prelude from James Cavitt , an inmate at San Quentin State Prison , Legend treats us to his version of Bob Marley's "Redemption Song" . "Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom" ?
At Free America , we've done a listening and learning tour .
We visited not only with prosecutors but with legislators , with inmates in our state and local prisons .
We've gone to immigration detention centers .
We've met a lot of people .
And we've seen that redemption and transformation can happen in our prisons , our jails and our immigration detention centers , giving hope to those who want to create a better life after serving their time .
Imagine if we also considered the front end of this prison pipeline .
What would it look like if we intervened , with rehabilitation as a core value - with love and compassion as core values ?
We would have a society that is safer , healthier and worthy of raising our children in .
I want to introduce you to James Cavitt .
James served 12 years in the San Quentin State Prison and is being released in 18 months .
Now James , like you and me , is more than the worst thing he's done .
He is a father , a husband , a son , a poet .
He committed a crime ; he's paying his debt , and working hard to build the skills to make the transition back to a productive life when he enters the civilian population again .
Now James , like millions of people behind bars , is an example of what happens if we believe that our failings don't define who we are , that we are all worthy of redemption and if we support those impacted by mass incarceration , we can all heal together .
I'd like to introduce you to James right now , and he's going to share his journey of redemption through spoken word .
James Cavitt: Thanks , John .
TED , welcome to San Quentin .
The talent is abundant behind prison walls .
Future software engineers , entrepreneurs , craftsmen , musicians and artists .
This piece is inspired by all of the hard work that men and women are doing on the inside to create better lives and futures for themselves after they serve their time .
This piece is entitled , "Where I Live" .
I live in a world where most people are too afraid to go .
Surrounded by tall , concrete walls , steel bars , where razor wire have a way of cutting away at the hopes for a brighter tomorrow .
I live in a world that kill people who kill people in order to teach people that killing people is wrong .
Imagine that .
Better yet , imagine a world where healed people helped hurt people heal and become strong .
Maybe then we would all be singin' "Redemption Song" .
I live in a world that has been called "hell on Earth" by those trapped inside .
But I've come to the stark realization that prison - it really is what you make it .
You see , in spite of the harshness of my reality , there is a silver lining .
I knew that my freedom was gonna come , it was just a matter of time .
And so I treated my first steps as if they were my last mile , and I realized that you don't have to be free in order to experience freedom .
And just because you're free , doesn't mean that you have freedom .
Many of us , for years , have been battling our inner demons .
We walk around smiling when inside we're really screamin': freedom !
Don't you get it ?
We're all serving time ; we're just in different places .
As for me , I choose to be free from the prisons I've created .
The key: forgiveness .
Action's my witness .
If we want freedom , then we gotta think different .
Because freedom ...
It isn't a place .
It's a mind setting .
Thank you .
John Legend: Old pirates , yes , they rob I .
Sold I to the merchant ships .
Minutes after they took I from the bottomless pit .
My hands were made strong by the hand of the almighty .
We forward in this generation triumphantly .
Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom ?
'Cause all I ever had - redemption songs .
Redemption songs .
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery .
None but ourselves can free our minds .
Have no fear for atomic energy 'cause none of them can stop the time .
How long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look ?
Some say it's just a part of it , we've got to fulfill the book .
Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom ?

Lisa Dyson: A forgotten Space Age technology could change how we grow food.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We're heading for a world population of 10 billion people - but what will we all eat ? Lisa Dyson rediscovered an idea developed by NASA in the 1960s for deep-space travel , and it could be a key to reinventing how we grow food .
Imagine you are a part of a crew of astronauts traveling to Mars or some distant planet .
The travel time could take a year or even longer .
The space on board and the resources would be limited .
So you and the crew would have to figure out how to produce food with minimal inputs .
What if you could bring with you just a few packets of seeds , and grow crops in a matter of hours ?
And what if those crops would then make more seeds , enabling you to feed the entire crew with just those few packets of seeds for the duration of the trip ?
Well , the scientists at NASA actually figured out a way to do this .
What they came up with was actually quite interesting .
It involved microorganisms , which are single-celled organisms .
And they also used hydrogen from water .
The types of microbes that they used were called hydrogenotrophs , and with these hydrogenotrophs , you can create a virtuous carbon cycle that would sustain life onboard a spacecraft .
Astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide , that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes and converted into a nutritious , carbon-rich crop .
The astronauts would then eat that carbon-rich crop and exhale the carbon out in the form of carbon dioxide , which would then be captured by the microbes , to create a nutritious crop , which then would be exhaled in the form of carbon dioxide by the astronauts .
So in this way , a closed-loop carbon cycle is created .
So why is this important ?
We need carbon to survive as humans , and we get our carbon from food .
On a long space journey , you simply wouldn't be able to pick up any carbon along the way , so you'd have to figure out how to recycle it on board .
This is a clever solution , right ?
But the thing is , that research didn't really go anywhere .
We haven't yet gone to Mars . We haven't yet gone to another planet .
And this was actually done in the '60s and '70s .
So a colleague of mine , Dr . John Reed , and I , were interested , actually , in carbon recycling here on Earth .
We wanted to come up with technical solutions to address climate change .
And we discovered this research by reading some papers published in the '60s - 1967 and later - articles about this work .
And we thought it was a really good idea .
So we said , well , Earth is actually like a spaceship .
We have limited space and limited resources , and on Earth , we really do need to figure out how to recycle our carbon better .
So we had the idea , can we take some of these NASA-type ideas and apply them to our carbon problem here on Earth ?
Could we cultivate these NASA-type microbes in order to make valuable products here on Earth ?
We started a company to do it .
And in that company , we discovered that these hydrogenotrophs - which I'll actually call nature's supercharged carbon recyclers - we found that they are a powerful class of microbes that had been largely overlooked and understudied , and that they could make some really valuable products .
So we began cultivating these products , these microbes , in our lab .
We found that we can make essential amino acids from carbon dioxide using these microbes .
And we even made a protein-rich meal that has an amino acid profile similar to what you might find in some animal proteins .
We began cultivating them even further , and we found that we can make oil .
Oils are used to manufacture many products .
We made an oil that was similar to a citrus oil , which can be used for flavoring and for fragrances , but it also can be used as a biodegradable cleaner or even as a jet fuel .
And we made an oil that's similar to palm oil .
Palm oil is used to manufacture a wide range of consumer and industrial goods .
We began working with manufacturers to scale up this technology , and we're currently working with them to bring some of these products to market .
We believe this type of technology can indeed help us profitably recycle carbon dioxide into valuable products - something that's beneficial for the planet but also beneficial for business .
That's what we're doing today .
But tomorrow , this type of technology and using these types of microbes actually could help us do something even greater if we take it to the next level .
We believe that this type of technology can actually help us address an issue with agriculture and allow us to create a type of agriculture that's sustainable , that will allow us to scale to meet the demands of tomorrow .
And why might we need a sustainable agriculture ?
Well , actually , it is estimated that the population will reach about 10 billion by 2050 , and we're projecting that we will need to increase food production by 70 percent .
In addition , we will need many more resources and raw materials to make consumer goods and industrial goods .
So how will we scale to meet that demand ?
Well , modern agriculture simply cannot sustainably scale to meet that demand .
There are a number of reasons why .
One of them is that modern agriculture is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases .
In fact , it emits more greenhouse gases than our cars , our trucks , our planes and our trains combined .
Another reason is that modern ag simply takes up a whole lot of land .
We have cleared 19 . 4 million square miles for crops and livestock .
What does that look like ?
Well , that's roughly the size of South America and Africa combined .
Let me give you a specific example .
In Indonesia , an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared totaling the size of approximately Ireland , between 2000 and 2012 .
Just think of all of the species , the diversity , that was removed in the process , whether plant life , insects or animal life .
And a natural carbon sink was also removed .
So let me make this real for you .
This clearing happened primarily to make room for palm plantations .
And as I mentioned before , palm oil is used to manufacture many products .
In fact , it is estimated that over 50 percent of consumer products are manufactured using palm oil .
And that includes things like ice cream , cookies ...
It includes cooking oils .
It also includes detergents , lotions , soaps .
You and I both probably have numerous items in our kitchens and our bathrooms that were manufactured using palm oil .
So you and I are direct beneficiaries of removed rainforests .
Modern ag has some problems , and we need solutions if we want to scale sustainably .
I believe that microbes can be a part of the answer - specifically , these supercharged carbon recyclers .
These supercharged carbon recyclers , like plants , serve as the natural recyclers in their ecosystems where they thrive .
And they thrive in exotic places on Earth , like hydrothermal vents and hot springs .
In those ecosystems , they take carbon and recycle it into the nutrients needed for those ecosystems .
And they're rich in nutrients , such as oils and proteins , minerals and carbohydrates .
And actually , microbes are already an integral part of our everyday lives .
If you enjoy a glass of pinot noir on a Friday night , after a long , hard work week , then you are enjoying a product of microbes .
If you enjoy a beer from your local microbrewery - a product of microbes .
Or bread , or cheese , or yogurt .
These are all products of microbes .
But the beauty and power associated with these supercharged carbon recyclers lies in the fact that they can actually produce in a matter of hours versus months .
That means we can make crops much faster than we're making them today .
They grow in the dark , so they can grow in any season and in any geography and any location .
They can grow in containers that require minimal space .
And we can get to a type of vertical agriculture .
Instead of our traditional horizontal agriculture that requires so much land , we can scale vertically , and as a result produce much more product per area .
If we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recyclers , then we wouldn't have to remove any more rainforests to make the food and the goods that we consume .
Because , at a large scale , you can actually make 10 , 000 times more output per land area than you could - for instance , if you used soybeans - if you planted soybeans on that same area of land over a period of a year .
Ten thousand times over a period of a year .
So this is what I mean by a new type of agriculture .
And this is what I mean by developing a system that allows us to sustainably scale to meet the demands of 10 billion .
And what would be the products of this new type of agriculture ?
Well , we've already made a protein meal , so you can imagine something similar to a soybean meal , or even cornmeal , or wheat flour .
We've already made oils , so you can imagine something similar to coconut oil or olive oil or soybean oil .
So this type of crop can actually produce the nutrients that would give us pasta and bread , cakes , nutritional items of many sorts .
Furthermore , since oil is used to manufacture multiple other goods , industrial products and consumer products , you can imagine being able to make detergents , soaps , lotions , etc . , using these types of crops .
Not only are we running out of space , but if we continue to operate under the status quo with modern agriculture , we run the risk of robbing our progeny of a beautiful planet .
But it doesn't have to be this way .
We can imagine a future of abundance .
Let us create systems that keep planet Earth , our spaceship , not only from not crashing , but let us also develop systems and ways of living that will be beneficial to the lives of ourselves and the 10 billion that will be on this planet by 2050 .
Thank you very much .
Marwa Al-Sabouni: How Syria's architecture laid the foundation for brutal war.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What caused the war in Syria ? Oppression , drought and religious differences all played key roles , but Marwa Al-Sabouni suggests another reason: architecture . Speaking to us over the Internet from Homs , where for the last six years she has watched the war tear her city apart , Al-Sabouni suggests that Syria's architecture divided its once tolerant and multicultural society into single-identity enclaves defined by class and religion . The country's future now depends on how it chooses to rebuild .
Hi . My name is Marwa , and I'm an architect .
I was born and raised in Homs , a city in the central western part of Syria , and I've always lived here .
After six years of war , Homs is now a half-destroyed city .
My family and I were lucky ; our place is still standing .
Although for two years , we were like prisoners at home .
Outside there were demonstrations and battles and bombings and snipers .
My husband and I used to run an architecture studio in the old town main square .
It's gone , as is most of the old town itself .
Half of the city's other neighborhoods are now rubble .
Since the ceasefire in late 2015 , large parts of Homs have been more or less quiet .
The economy is completely broken , and people are still fighting .
The merchants who had stalls in the old city market now trade out of sheds on the streets .
Under our apartment , there is a carpenter , sweetshops , a butcher , a printing house , workshops , among many more .
I have started teaching part-time , and with my husband , who juggles several jobs , we've opened a small bookshop .
Other people do all sorts of jobs to get by .
When I look at my destroyed city , of course , I ask myself: What has led to this senseless war ?
Syria was largely a place of tolerance , historically accustomed to variety , accommodating a wide range of beliefs , origins , customs , goods , food .
How did my country - a country with communities living harmoniously together and comfortable in discussing their differences - how did it degenerate into civil war , violence , displacement and unprecedented sectarian hatred ?
There were many reasons that had led to the war - social , political and economic .
They all have played their role .
But I believe there is one key reason that has been overlooked and which is important to analyze , because from it will largely depend whether we can make sure that this doesn't happen again .
And that reason is architecture .
Architecture in my country has played an important role in creating , directing and amplifying conflict between warring factions , and this is probably true for other countries as well .
There is a sure correspondence between the architecture of a place and the character of the community that has settled there .
Architecture plays a key role in whether a community crumbles or comes together .
Syrian society has long lived the coexistence of different traditions and backgrounds .
Syrians have experienced the prosperity of open trade and sustainable communities .
They have enjoyed the true meaning of belonging to a place , and that was reflected in their built environment , in the mosques and churches built back-to-back , in the interwoven souks and public venues , and the proportions and sizes based on principles of humanity and harmony .
This architecture of mixity can still be read in the remains .
The old Islamic city in Syria was built over a multilayered past , integrating with it and embracing its spirit .
So did its communities .
People lived and worked with each other in a place that gave them a sense of belonging and made them feel at home .
They shared a remarkably unified existence .
But over the last century , gradually this delicate balance of these places has been interfered with ; first , by the urban planners of the colonial period , when the French went enthusiastically about , transforming what they saw as the un-modern Syrian cities .
They blew up city streets and relocated monuments .
They called them improvements , and they were the beginning of a long , slow unraveling .
The traditional urbanism and architecture of our cities assured identity and belonging not by separation , but by intertwining .
But over time , the ancient became worthless , and the new , coveted .
The harmony of the built environment and social environment got trampled over by elements of modernity - brutal , unfinished concrete blocks , neglect , aesthetic devastation , divisive urbanism that zoned communities by class , creed or affluence .
And the same was happening to the community .
As the shape of the built environment changed , so the lifestyles and sense of belonging of the communities also started changing .
From a register of togetherness , of belonging , architecture became a way of differentiation , and communities started drifting apart from the very fabric that used to unite them , and from the soul of the place that used to represent their common existence .
While many reasons had led to the Syrian war , we shouldn't underestimate the way in which , by contributing to the loss of identity and self-respect , urban zoning and misguided , inhumane architecture have nurtured sectarian divisions and hatred .
Over time , the united city has morphed into a city center with ghettos along its circumference .
And in turn , the coherent communities became distinct social groups , alienated from each other and alienated from the place .
From my point of view , losing the sense of belonging to a place and a sense of sharing it with someone else has made it a lot easier to destroy .
The clear example can be seen in the informal housing system , which used to host , before the war , over 40 percent of the population .
Yes , prior to the war , almost half of the Syrian population lived in slums , peripheral areas without proper infrastructure , made of endless rows of bare block boxes containing people , people who mostly belonged to the same group , whether based on religion , class , origin or all of the above .
This ghettoized urbanism proved to be a tangible precursor of war .
Conflict is much easier between pre-categorized areas - where the "others" live .
The ties that used to bind the city together - whether they were social , through coherent building , or economic , through trade in the souk , or religious , through the coexistent presence - were all lost in the misguided and visionless modernization of the built environment .
Allow me an aside .
When I read about heterogeneous urbanism in other parts of the world , involving ethnic neighborhoods in British cities or around Paris or Brussels , I recognize the beginning of the kind of instability we have witnessed so disastrously here in Syria .
We have severely destroyed cities , such as Homs , Aleppo , Daraa and many others , and almost half of the population of the country is now displaced .
Hopefully , the war will end , and the question that , as an architect , I have to ask , is: How do we rebuild ?
What are the principles that we should adopt in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes ?
From my point of view , the main focus should be on creating places that make their people feel they belong .
Architecture and planning need to recapture some of the traditional values that did just that , creating the conditions for coexistence and peace , values of beauty that don't exhibit ostentation , but rather , approachability and ease , moral values that promote generosity and acceptance , architecture that is for everyone to enjoy , not just for the elite , just as used to be in the shadowed alleys of the old Islamic city , mixed designs that encourage a sense of community .
There is a neighborhood here in Homs that's called Baba Amr that has been fully destroyed .
Almost two years ago , I introduced this design into a UN-Habitat competition for rebuilding it .
The idea was to create an urban fabric inspired by a tree , capable of growing and spreading organically , echoing the traditional bridge hanging over the old alleys , and incorporating apartments , private courtyards , shops , workshops , places for parking and playing and leisure , trees and shaded areas .
It's far from perfect , obviously .
I drew it during the few hours of electricity we get .
And there are many possible ways to express belonging and community through architecture .
But compare it with the freestanding , disconnected blocks proposed by the official project for rebuilding Baba Amr .
Architecture is not the axis around which all human life rotates , but it has the power to suggest and even direct human activity .
In that sense , settlement , identity and social integration are all the producer and product of effective urbanism .
The coherent urbanism of the old Islamic city and of many old European towns , for instance , promote integration , while rows of soulless housing or tower blocks , even when they are luxurious , tend to promote isolation and "otherness" .
Even simple things like shaded places or fruit plants or drinking water inside the city can make a difference in how people feel towards the place , and whether they consider it a generous place that gives , a place that's worth keeping , contributing to , or whether they see it as an alienating place , full of seeds of anger .
In order for a place to give , its architecture should be giving , too .
Our built environment matters .
The fabric of our cities is reflected in the fabric of our souls .
And whether in the shape of informal concrete slums or broken social housing or trampled old towns or forests of skyscrapers , the contemporary urban archetypes that have emerged all across the Middle East have been one cause of the alienation and fragmentation of our communities .
We can learn from this .
We can learn how to rebuild in another way , how to create an architecture that doesn't contribute only to the practical and economic aspects of people's lives , but also to their social , spiritual and psychological needs .
Those needs were totally overlooked in the Syrian cities before the war .
We need to create again cities that are shared by the communities that inhabit them .
If we do so , people will not feel the need to seek identities opposed to the other identities all around , because they will all feel at home .
Thank you for listening .
Eric Haseltine: What will be the next big scientific breakthrough ?
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Throughout history , speculation has spurred beautiful , revolutionary science - opening our eyes to entirely new universes . "I'm not talking about science that takes baby steps" , says Eric Haseltine . "I'm talking about science that takes enormous leaps" . In this talk , Haseltine passionately takes us to the edges of intellectual pursuit with two ideas - one that's already made history , and the other that's digging into one of humanity's biggest questions with admirable ambition .
Tonight , I'm going to share with you my passion for science .
I'm not talking about science that takes baby steps .
I'm talking about science that takes enormous leaps .
I'm talking Darwin , I'm talking Einstein , I'm talking revolutionary science that turns the world on its head .
In a moment , I'm going to talk about two ideas that might do this .
I say "might" because , with revolutionary ideas , most are flat wrong , and even those that are right seldom have the impact that we want them to have .
To explain why I picked two ideas in particular , I'm going to start with a mystery .
1847 , Vienna , Austria .
Ignaz Semmelweis was a somber , compulsively thorough doctor who ran two maternity clinics .
They were identical except for one thing .
Women were dying of high fevers soon after giving birth three times more often at one of the clinics than at the other .
Trying to figure out what the difference was that caused this , Semmelweis looked at everything he could .
Sanitation ? No .
Medical procedures ? No .
Air flow ? No .
The puzzle went unsolved until he happened to autopsy a doctor who died of an infected scalpel cut .
The doctor's symptoms were identical to those of the mothers who were dying .
How was that possible ?
How could a male doctor get the same thing as new mothers ?
Semmelweis reconstructed everything the doctor had done right before he got sick , and he discovered that he'd been autopsying a corpse .
Had something gotten in his wound that killed him ?
With growing excitement , Semmelweis looked for any connection he could between dead bodies in the morgue and dead mothers in his delivery room , and he found it .
It turned out that at the hospital with the high death rate , but not the others , doctors delivered babies immediately after autopsying corpses in the morgue .
Aha ! Corpses were contaminating the doctors' hands and killing his mothers .
So he ordered the doctors to sterilize their hands , and the deaths stopped .
Dr . Ignaz Semmelweis had discovered infectious disease .
But the doctors of the day thought he was crazy , because they knew , and had for hundreds of years , that odorous vapors called miasmas caused disease , not these hypothetical particles that you couldn't see .
It took 20 years for Frenchman Louis Pasteur to prove that Semmelweis was right .
Pasteur was an agricultural chemist who tried to figure out why milk and beer spoiled so often .
He found that bacteria were the culprits .
He also found that bacteria could kill people in exactly the same way that Semmelweis's patients were dying .
We now look at what I want to talk about tonight , in two ideas .
We saw it with Semmelweis , that he was a revolutionary .
He did it for two reasons .
One , he opened our eyes to a completely new world .
We'd known since the 1680s about bacteria .
We just didn't know that bacteria killed people .
And he also demolished fond ideas that people kept close to their heart .
Miasmas didn't kill people . Bacteria killed people .
So this brings me to the two ideas I want to talk about tonight .
One has opened our eyes to a completely new universe , and the other attacks long-held beliefs .
Let's get started with Dr . Eric Betzig .
He's a physicist who has opened our eyes to an entirely new world by violating the laws of physics .
Betzig is a true rebel .
He quit a job at prestigious Bell Laboratory inventing new microscopes for biology because he thought scientists were taking his brilliant inventions and doing lousy work with them .
So he became a househusband , but he never lost his passion for figuring out how to get microscopes to see finer and finer details than had ever been seen before or ever could be seen .
This is crucial if we're ever going to understand how cells work , and how cancer works , and how something 150th the size of a head of a pin can do all these amazing things , like make proteins and move charges around and all of those things .
There's just one problem .
There's this thing called the law of physics , and part of the law of physics is the thing called the diffraction limit .
The diffraction limit is kind of like when you go to a doctor's office , you can only see so far down , no matter how good glasses you have .
This was a so-called impossible problem .
But one of Betzig's friends figured out how to take a tiny molecule that was smaller than the best microscope could see and get it to light up and fluoresce .
"Aha" ! Betzig said .
"I think maybe the laws of physics are not so unbreakable after all" .
So he lashed together a microscope in his friend's living room .
He had no laboratory .
This revolutionary instrument got different protein molecules to light up in different colors , and with a computer , he was able to turn very , very fuzzy blurs into very sharp dots and produce images of unprecedented and startling clarity .
For this work , last year , Eric Betzig won the Nobel Prize .
Why ?
Because now we can see with unprecedented detail things that we never had seen before , and now doctors can get a better handle on things like cancer .
But do you think Betzig was satisfied there ?
No .
He wanted movies .
The problem was that even the genius microscopes that he invented were just too slow .
So what did he do ?
He came up with a 200-year-old idea called moiré patterns .
So the way that works is if you take two very , very fine patterns and you move them across each other , you will see a gross pattern that a microscope can see that otherwise you would not be able to see .
So he applied this technique to taking a really blurry image of a cell and moving lots of structured light patterns across it until this cell became crystal clear .
And here is the result: a mysterious new world , full of strange things zipping around doing things that we don't know what they're doing .
But when we figure it out , we'll have a better handle on life itself .
For example , those green globs that you see ?
Those things are called clathrins .
They're molecules that protect other molecules as they move through a cell .
Unfortunately , viruses sometimes hijack those to infect cells .
Also , you see those little squiggly wormlike things moving around ?
Those are actin molecules .
Unfortunately , viruses also climb down those things to get into the cell nucleus to replicate themselves and make you sick .
Now that we can look at movies of what's actually going on deep inside a cell , we have a much better chance of curing viral diseases like AIDS .
So when you look at a movie like this , it's very clear that Betzig has opened our eyes to a completely new world .
But he hasn't shattered any cherished beliefs .
That leads us to Dr . Aubrey de Grey at Cambridge .
De Grey definitely has scientists squirming with an interesting idea: we can be immortal .
We can beat aging .
Now , most scientists think he's a crackpot .
Any Biology 101 student knows that aging is an inevitable consequence of living .
For example , when we eat , we take in food and we metabolize it , and that throws off what we call free radicals .
You might have heard of those .
Also known as oxygen ions , those bind to our DNA , cause it to mutate , and cause us to get old and lose our hair .
It's just like , no , it's exactly like oxygen binding to iron and making it rust .
So you age because you rust out .
Oh , and scientists also know there is something called immortality: in cancer cells .
So if you stop aging , all of you are going to turn into giant walking malignant tumors .
These are cherished beliefs , but could de Grey be on to something ?
I think he deserves a closer look .
First of all , I have a really hard time seeing him as a crackpot .
Yeah , he started off life as a computer scientist , not a biologist , but he earned a PhD in biology from Cambridge , and he has published some very significant work on mitochondrial DNA and a bunch of other stuff .
Secondly , he started an antiaging foundation that has identified seven different causes of aging , to me , that seem very plausible , and he is hot in pursuit of fixes for every single one of them .
For example , one of the reasons we age is that our mitochondrial DNA mutates , and we get kind of old and our cells lose energy .
He believes , and he's made a convincing case , that using viruses we can do gene therapy , fix that DNA and rejuvenate our cells .
One more thing .
We have an existent proof that extreme longevity is possible .
Bristlecone pine trees live 5 , 000 years , and some lobsters don't age at all .
Now , this doesn't mean that de Grey is going to revolutionize our lifespans .
I mean , after all , we're not trees , and most of us are not lobsters .
But I've got to believe that there are Darwins and Einsteins out there , and I'll tell you why .
Consider this: there are seven times more people alive today than during Darwin's time .
There are four times as many people alive today as Einstein .
When you consider that the proportion of scientists in the population has skyrocketed , there are now seven million scientists .
I've got to believe , and I do believe , that there's one of them out there who is working right now in obscurity to rock our lives , and I don't know about you , but I can't wait to be rocked .
Thank you .
Alexander Betts: Why Brexit happened - and what to do next.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We are embarrassingly unaware of how divided our societies are , and Brexit grew out of a deep , unexamined divide between those that fear globalization and those that embrace it , says social scientist Alexander Betts . How do we now address that fear as well as growing disillusionment with the political establishment , while refusing to give in to xenophobia and nationalism ? Join Betts as he discusses four post-Brexit steps toward a more inclusive world .
I am British .
Never before has the phrase "I am British" elicited so much pity .
I come from an island where many of us like to believe there's been a lot of continuity over the last thousand years .
We tend to have historically imposed change on others but done much less of it ourselves .
So it came as an immense shock to me when I woke up on the morning of June 24 to discover that my country had voted to leave the European Union , my Prime Minister had resigned , and Scotland was considering a referendum that could bring to an end the very existence of the United Kingdom .
So that was an immense shock for me , and it was an immense shock for many people , but it was also something that , over the following several days , created a complete political meltdown in my country .
There were calls for a second referendum , almost as if , following a sports match , we could ask the opposition for a replay .
Everybody was blaming everybody else .
People blamed the Prime Minister for calling the referendum in the first place .
They blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough .
The young accused the old .
The educated blamed the less well-educated .
That complete meltdown was made even worse by the most tragic element of it: levels of xenophobia and racist abuse in the streets of Britain at a level that I have never seen before in my lifetime .
People are now talking about whether my country is becoming a Little England , or , as one of my colleagues put it , whether we're about to become a 1950s nostalgia theme park floating in the Atlantic Ocean .
But my question is really , should we have the degree of shock that we've experienced since ?
Was it something that took place overnight ?
Or are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today ?
So I want to take a step back and ask two very basic questions .
First , what does Brexit represent , not just for my country , but for all of us around the world ?
And second , what can we do about it ?
How should we all respond ?
So first , what does Brexit represent ?
Hindsight is a wonderful thing .
Brexit teaches us many things about our society and about societies around the world .
It highlights in ways that we seem embarrassingly unaware of how divided our societies are .
The vote split along lines of age , education , class and geography .
Young people didn't turn out to vote in great numbers , but those that did wanted to remain .
Older people really wanted to leave the European Union .
Geographically , it was London and Scotland that most strongly committed to being part of the European Union , while in other parts of the country there was very strong ambivalence .
Those divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously .
But more profoundly , the vote teaches us something about the nature of politics today .
Contemporary politics is no longer just about right and left .
It's no longer just about tax and spend .
It's about globalization .
The fault line of contemporary politics is between those that embrace globalization and those that fear globalization .
If we look at why those who wanted to leave - we call them "Leavers" , as opposed to "Remainers" - we see two factors in the opinion polls that really mattered .
The first was immigration , and the second sovereignty , and these represent a desire for people to take back control of their own lives and the feeling that they are unrepresented by politicians .
But those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation .
They represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders in ways that many of us would reject .
What I want to suggest is the picture is more complicated than that , that liberal internationalists , like myself , and I firmly include myself in that picture , need to write ourselves back into the picture in order to understand how we've got to where we are today .
When we look at the voting patterns across the United Kingdom , we can visibly see the divisions .
The blue areas show Remain and the red areas Leave .
When I looked at this , what personally struck me was the very little time in my life I've actually spent in many of the red areas .
I suddenly realized that , looking at the top 50 areas in the UK that have the strongest Leave vote , I've spent a combined total of four days of my life in those areas .
In some of those places , I didn't even know the names of the voting districts .
It was a real shock to me , and it suggested that people like me who think of ourselves as inclusive , open and tolerant , perhaps don't know our own countries and societies nearly as well as we like to believe .
And the challenge that comes from that is we need to find a new way to narrate globalization to those people , to recognize that for those people who have not necessarily been to university , who haven't necessarily grown up with the Internet , that don't get opportunities to travel , they may be unpersuaded by the narrative that we find persuasive in our often liberal bubbles .
It means that we need to reach out more broadly and understand .
In the Leave vote , a minority have peddled the politics of fear and hatred , creating lies and mistrust around , for instance , the idea that the vote on Europe could reduce the number of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Europe , when the vote on leaving had nothing to do with immigration from outside the European Union .
But for a significant majority of the Leave voters the concern was disillusionment with the political establishment .
This was a protest vote for many , a sense that nobody represented them , that they couldn't find a political party that spoke for them , and so they rejected that political establishment .
This replicates around Europe and much of the liberal democratic world .
We see it with the rise in popularity of Donald Trump in the United States , with the growing nationalism of Viktor Orbán in Hungary , with the increase in popularity of Marine Le Pen in France .
The specter of Brexit is in all of our societies .
So the question I think we need to ask is my second question , which is how should we collectively respond ?
For all of us who care about creating liberal , open , tolerant societies , we urgently need a new vision , a vision of a more tolerant , inclusive globalization , one that brings people with us rather than leaving them behind .
That vision of globalization is one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globalization .
The consensus amongst economists is that free trade , the movement of capital , the movement of people across borders benefit everyone on aggregate .
The consensus amongst international relations scholars is that globalization brings interdependence , which brings cooperation and peace .
But globalization also has redistributive effects .
It creates winners and losers .
To take the example of migration , we know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole under almost all circumstances .
But we also have to be very aware that there are redistributive consequences , that importantly , low-skilled immigration can lead to a reduction in wages for the most impoverished in our societies and also put pressure on house prices .
That doesn't detract from the fact that it's positive , but it means more people have to share in those benefits and recognize them .
In 2002 , the former Secretary-General of the United Nations , Kofi Annan , gave a speech at Yale University , and that speech was on the topic of inclusive globalization .
That was the speech in which he coined that term .
And he said , and I paraphrase , "The glass house of globalization has to be open to all if it is to remain secure .
Bigotry and ignorance are the ugly face of exclusionary and antagonistic globalization" .
That idea of inclusive globalization was briefly revived in 2008 in a conference on progressive governance involving many of the leaders of European countries .
But amid austerity and the financial crisis of 2008 , the concept disappeared almost without a trace .
Globalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda .
It's perceived to be part of an elite agenda rather than something that benefits all .
And it needs to be reclaimed on a far more inclusive basis than it is today .
So the question is , how can we achieve that goal ?
How can we balance on the one hand addressing fear and alienation while on the other hand refusing vehemently to give in to xenophobia and nationalism ?
That is the question for all of us .
And I think , as a social scientist , that social science offers some places to start .
Our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point .
The first relates to the idea of civic education .
What stands out from Brexit is the gap between public perception and empirical reality .
It's been suggested that we've moved to a postfactual society , where evidence and truth no longer matter , and lies have equal status to the clarity of evidence .
So how can we - How can we rebuild respect for truth and evidence into our liberal democracies ?
It has to begin with education , but it has to start with the recognition that there are huge gaps .
In 2014 , the pollster Ipsos MORI published a survey on attitudes to immigration , and it showed that as numbers of immigrants increase , so public concern with immigration also increases , although it obviously didn't unpack causality , because this could equally be to do not so much with numbers but the political and media narrative around it .
But the same survey also revealed huge public misinformation and misunderstanding about the nature of immigration .
For example , in these attitudes in the United Kingdom , the public believed that levels of asylum were a greater proportion of immigration than they were , but they also believed the levels of educational migration were far lower as a proportion of overall migration than they actually are .
So we have to address this misinformation , the gap between perception and reality on key aspects of globalization .
And that can't just be something that's left to our schools , although that's important to begin at an early age .
It has to be about lifelong civic participation and public engagement that we all encourage as societies .
The second thing that I think is an opportunity is the idea to encourage more interaction across diverse communities .
One of the things that stands out for me very strikingly , looking at immigration attitudes in the United Kingdom , is that ironically , the regions of my country that are the most tolerant of immigrants have the highest numbers of immigrants .
So for instance , London and the Southeast have the highest numbers of immigrants , and they are also by far the most tolerant areas .
It's those areas of the country that have the lowest levels of immigration that actually are the most exclusionary and intolerant towards migrants .
So we need to encourage exchange programs .
We need to ensure that older generations who maybe can't travel get access to the Internet .
We need to encourage , even on a local and national level , more movement , more participation , more interaction with people who we don't know and whose views we might not necessarily agree with .
The third thing that I think is crucial , though , and this is really fundamental , is we have to ensure that everybody shares in the benefits of globalization .
This illustration from the Financial Times post-Brexit is really striking .
It shows tragically that those people who voted to leave the European Union were those who actually benefited the most materially from trade with the European Union .
But the problem is that those people in those areas didn't perceive themselves to be beneficiaries .
They didn't believe that they were actually getting access to material benefits of increased trade and increased mobility around the world .
I work on questions predominantly to do with refugees , and one of the ideas I spent a lot of my time preaching , mainly to developing countries around the world , is that in order to encourage the integration of refugees , we can't just benefit the refugee populations , we also have to address the concerns of the host communities in local areas .
But in looking at that , one of the policy prescriptions is that we have to provide disproportionately better education facilities , health facilities , access to social services in those regions of high immigration to address the concerns of those local populations .
But while we encourage that around the developing world , we don't take those lessons home and incorporate them in our own societies .
Furthermore , if we're going to really take seriously the need to ensure people share in the economic benefits , our businesses and corporations need a model of globalization that recognizes that they , too , have to take people with them .
The fourth and final idea I want to put forward is an idea that we need more responsible politics .
There's very little social science evidence that compares attitudes on globalization .
But from the surveys that do exist , what we can see is there's huge variation across different countries and time periods in those countries for attitudes and tolerance of questions like migration and mobility on the one hand and free trade on the other .
But one hypothesis that I think emerges from a cursory look at that data is the idea that polarized societies are far less tolerant of globalization .
It's the societies like Sweden in the past , like Canada today , where there is a centrist politics , where right and left work together , that we encourage supportive attitudes towards globalization .
And what we see around the world today is a tragic polarization , a failure to have dialogue between the extremes in politics , and a gap in terms of that liberal center ground that can encourage communication and a shared understanding .
We might not achieve that today , but at the very least we have to call upon our politicians and our media to drop a language of fear and be far more tolerant of one another .
These ideas are very tentative , and that's in part because this needs to be an inclusive and shared project .
I am still British .
I am still European .
I am still a global citizen .
For those of us who believe that our identities are not mutually exclusive , we have to all work together to ensure that globalization takes everyone with us and doesn't leave people behind .
Only then will we truly reconcile democracy and globalization .
Thank you .
Shubhendu Sharma: How to grow a forest in your backyard.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Forests don't have to be far-flung nature reserves , isolated from human life . Instead , we can grow them right where we are - even in cities . Eco-entrepreneur and TED Fellow Shubhendu Sharma grows ultra-dense , biodiverse mini-forests of native species in urban areas by engineering soil , microbes and biomass to kickstart natural growth processes . Follow along as he describes how to grow a 100-year-old forest in just 10 years , and learn how you can get in on this tiny jungle party .
This is a man-made forest .
It can spread over acres and acres of area , or it could fit in a small space - as small as your house garden .
Each of these forests is just two years old .
I have a forest in the backyard of my own house .
It attracts a lot of biodiversity .
I wake up to this every morning , like a Disney princess .
I am an entrepreneur who facilitates the making of these forests professionally .
We have helped factories , farms , schools , homes , resorts , apartment buildings , public parks and even a zoo to have one of such forests .
A forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together .
A forest can be an integral part of our urban existence .
A forest , for me , is a place so dense with trees that you just can't walk into it .
It doesn't matter how big or small they are .
Most of the world we live in today was forest .
This was before human intervention .
Then we built up our cities on those forests , like São Paulo , forgetting that we belong to nature as well , as much as 8 . 4 million other species on the planet .
Our habitat stopped being our natural habitat .
But not anymore for some of us .
A few others and I today make these forests professionally - anywhere and everywhere .
I'm an industrial engineer .
I specialize in making cars .
In my previous job at Toyota , I learned how to convert natural resources into products .
To give you an example , we would drip the sap out of a rubber tree , convert it into raw rubber and make a tire out of it - the product .
But these products can never become a natural resource again .
We separate the elements from nature and convert them into an irreversible state .
That's industrial production .
Nature , on the other hand , works in a totally opposite way .
The natural system produces by bringing elements together , atom by atom .
All the natural products become a natural resource again .
This is something which I learned when I made a forest in the backyard of my own house .
And this was the first time I worked with nature , rather than against it .
Since then , we have made 75 such forests in 25 cities across the world .
Every time we work at a new place , we find that every single element needed to make a forest is available right around us .
All we have to do is to bring these elements together and let nature take over .
To make a forest we start with soil .
We touch , feel and even taste it to identify what properties it lacks .
If the soil is made up of small particles it becomes compact - so compact , that water cannot seep in .
We mix some local biomass available around , which can help soil become more porous .
Water can now seep in .
If the soil doesn't have the capacity to hold water , we will mix some more biomass - some water-absorbent material like peat or bagasse , so soil can hold this water and it stays moist .
To grow , plants need water , sunlight and nutrition .
What if the soil doesn't have any nutrition in it ?
We don't just add nutrition directly to the soil .
That would be the industrial way .
It goes against nature .
We instead add microorganisms to the soil .
They produce the nutrients in the soil naturally .
They feed on the biomass we have mixed in the soil , so all they have to do is eat and multiply .
And as their number grows , the soil starts breathing again .
It becomes alive .
We survey the native tree species of the place .
How do we decide what's native or not ?
Well , whatever existed before human intervention is native .
That's the simple rule .
We survey a national park to find the last remains of a natural forest .
We survey the sacred groves , or sacred forests around old temples .
And if we don't find anything at all , we go to museums to see the seeds or wood of trees existing there a long time ago .
We research old paintings , poems and literature from the place , to identify the tree species belonging there .
Once we know our trees , we divide them in four different layers: shrub layer , sub-tree layer , tree layer and canopy layer .
We fix the ratios of each layer , and then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix .
If we are making a fruit forest , we increase the percentage of fruit-bearing trees .
It could be a flowering forest , a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees , or it could simply be a native , wild evergreen forest .
We collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them .
We make sure that trees belonging to the same layer are not planted next to each other , or they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tall .
We plant the saplings close to each other .
On the surface , we spread a thick layer of mulch , so when it's hot outside the soil stays moist .
When it's cold , frost formation happens only on the mulch , so soil can still breathe while it's freezing outside .
The soil is very soft - so soft , that roots can penetrate into it easily , rapidly .
Initially , the forest doesn't seem like it's growing , but it's growing under the surface .
In the first three months , roots reach a depth of one meter .
These roots form a mesh , tightly holding the soil .
Microbes and fungi live throughout this network of roots .
So if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree , these microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree .
Whenever it rains , magically , mushrooms appear overnight .
And this means the soil below has a healthy fungal network .
Once these roots are established , forest starts growing on the surface .
As the forest grows we keep watering it - for the next two to three years , we water the forest .
We want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees , so we remove the weeds growing on the ground .
As this forest grows , it blocks the sunlight .
Eventually , the forest becomes so dense that sunlight can't reach the ground anymore .
Weeds cannot grow now , because they need sunlight as well .
At this stage , every single drop of water that falls into the forest doesn't evaporate back into the atmosphere .
This dense forest condenses the moist air and retains its moisture .
We gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest .
And even without watering , the forest floor stays moist and sometimes even dark .
Now , when a single leaf falls on this forest floor , it immediately starts decaying .
This decayed biomass forms humus , which is food for the forest .
As the forest grows , more leaves fall on the surface - it means more humus is produced , it means more food so the forest can grow still bigger .
And this forest keeps growing exponentially .
Once established , these forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again - probably forever .
In a natural forest like this , no management is the best management .
It's a tiny jungle party .
This forest grows as a collective .
If the same trees - same species - would have been planted independently , it wouldn't grow so fast .
And this is how we create a 100-year-old forest in just 10 years .
Thank you very much .
Emma Marris: Nature is everywhere - we just need to learn to see it.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How do you define "nature" ? If we define it as that which is untouched by humans , then we won't have any left , says environmental writer Emma Marris . She urges us to consider a new definition of nature - one that includes not only pristine wilderness but also the untended patches of plants growing in urban spaces - and encourages us to bring our children out to touch and tinker with it , so that one day they might love and protect it .
We are stealing nature from our children .
Now , when I say this , I don't mean that we are destroying nature that they will have wanted us to preserve , although that is unfortunately also the case .
What I mean here is that we've started to define nature in a way that's so purist and so strict that under the definition we're creating for ourselves , there won't be any nature left for our children when they're adults .
But there's a fix for this .
So let me explain .
Right now , humans use half of the world to live , to grow their crops and their timber , to pasture their animals .
If you added up all the human beings , we would weigh 10 times as much as all the wild mammals put together .
We cut roads through the forest .
We have added little plastic particles to the sand on ocean beaches .
We've changed the chemistry of the soil with our artificial fertilizers .
And of course , we've changed the chemistry of the air .
So when you take your next breath , you'll be breathing in 42 percent more carbon dioxide than if you were breathing in 1750 .
So all of these changes , and many others , have come to be kind of lumped together under this rubric of the "Anthropocene" .
And this is a term that some geologists are suggesting we should give to our current epoch , given how pervasive human influence has been over it .
Now , it's still just a proposed epoch , but I think it's a helpful way to think about the magnitude of human influence on the planet .
So where does this put nature ?
What counts as nature in a world where everything is influenced by humans ?
So 25 years ago , environmental writer Bill McKibben said that because nature was a thing apart from man and because climate change meant that every centimeter of the Earth was altered by man , then nature was over .
In fact , he called his book "The End of Nature" .
I disagree with this . I just disagree with this .
I disagree with this definition of nature , because , fundamentally , we are animals .
Right ? Like , we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share a planet , and all the other plants , and all the other microbes .
And so I think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity , man or woman .
I think that nature is anywhere where life thrives , anywhere where there are multiple species together , anywhere that's green and blue and thriving and filled with life and growing .
And under that definition , things look a little bit different .
Now , I understand that there are certain parts of this nature that speak to us in a special way .
Places like Yellowstone , or the Mongolian steppe , or the Great Barrier Reef or the Serengeti .
Places that we think of as kind of Edenic representations of a nature before we screwed everything up .
And in a way , they are less impacted by our day to day activities .
Many of these places have no roads or few roads , so on , like such .
But ultimately , even these Edens are deeply influenced by humans .
Now , let's just take North America , for example , since that's where we're meeting .
So between about 15 , 000 years ago when people first came here , they started a process of interacting with the nature that led to the extinction of a big slew of large-bodied animals , from the mastodon to the giant ground sloth , all of these cool animals that unfortunately are no longer with us .
And when those animals went extinct , you know , the ecosystems didn't stand still .
Massive ripple effects changed grasslands into forests , changed the composition of forest from one tree to another .
So even in these Edens , even in these perfect-looking places that seem to remind us of a past before humans , we're essentially looking at a humanized landscape .
Not just these prehistoric humans , but historical humans , indigenous people all the way up until the moment when the first colonizers showed up .
And the case is the same for the other continents as well .
Humans have just been involved in nature in a very influential way for a very long time .
Now , just recently , someone told me , "Oh , but there are still wild places" .
And I said , "Where ? Where ? I want to go" .
And he said , "The Amazon" .
And I was like , "Oh , the Amazon . I was just there .
It's awesome . National Geographic sent me to Manú National Park , which is in the Peruvian Amazon , but it's a big chunk of rainforest , uncleared , no roads , protected as a national park , one of the most , in fact , biodiverse parks in the world .
And when I got in there with my canoe , what did I find , but people .
People have been living there for hundreds and thousands of years .
People live there , and they don't just float over the jungle .
They have a meaningful relationship with the landscape .
They hunt . They grow crops .
They domesticate crops .
They use the natural resources to build their houses , to thatch their houses .
They even make pets out of animals that we consider to be wild animals .
These people are there and they're interacting with the environment in a way that's really meaningful and that you can see in the environment .
Now , I was with an anthropologist on this trip , and he told me , as we were floating down the river , he said , "There are no demographic voids in the Amazon" .
This statement has really stuck with me , because what it means is that the whole Amazon is like this .
There's people everywhere .
And many other tropical forests are the same , and not just tropical forests .
People have influenced ecosystems in the past , and they continue to influence them in the present , even in places where they're harder to notice .
So , if all of the definitions of nature that we might want to use that involve it being untouched by humanity or not having people in it , if all of those actually give us a result where we don't have any nature , then maybe they're the wrong definitions .
Maybe we should define it by the presence of multiple species , by the presence of a thriving life .
Now , if we do it that way , what do we get ?
Well , it's this kind of miracle .
All of a sudden , there's nature all around us .
All of a sudden , we see this Monarch caterpillar munching on this plant , and we realize that there it is , and it's in this empty lot in Chattanooga .
And look at this empty lot .
I mean , there's , like , probably , a dozen , minimum , plant species growing there , supporting all kinds of insect life , and this is a completely unmanaged space , a completely wild space .
This is a kind of wild nature right under our nose , that we don't even notice .
And there's an interesting little paradox , too .
So this nature , this kind of wild , untended part of our urban , peri-urban , suburban agricultural existence that flies under the radar , it's arguably more wild than a national park , because national parks are very carefully managed in the 21st century .
Crater Lake in southern Oregon , which is my closest national park , is a beautiful example of a landscape that seems to be coming out of the past .
But they're managing it carefully .
One of the issues they have now is white bark pine die-off .
White bark pine is a beautiful , charismatic - I'll say it's a charismatic megaflora that grows up at high altitude - and it's got all these problems right now with disease .
There's a blister rust that was introduced , bark beetle .
So to deal with this , the park service has been planting rust-resistant white bark pine seedlings in the park , even in areas that they are otherwise managing as wilderness .
And they're also putting out beetle repellent in key areas as I saw last time I went hiking there .
And this kind of thing is really much more common than you would think .
National parks are heavily managed .
The wildlife is kept to a certain population size and structure .
Fires are suppressed .
Fires are started .
Non-native species are removed .
Native species are reintroduced .
And in fact , I took a look , and Banff National Park is doing all of the things I just listed: suppressing fire , having fire , radio-collaring wolves , reintroducing bison .
It takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched .
And in a further irony , these places that we love the most are the places that we love a little too hard , sometimes .
A lot of us like to go there , and because we're managing them to be stable in the face of a changing planet , they often are becoming more fragile over time .
Which means that they're the absolute worst places to take your children on vacation , because you can't do anything there .
You can't climb the trees . You can't fish the fish .
You can't make a campfire out in the middle of nowhere .
You can't take home the pinecones .
There are so many rules and restrictions that from a child's point of view , this is , like , the worst nature ever .
Because children don't want to hike through a beautiful landscape for five hours and then look at a beautiful view .
That's maybe what we want to do as adults , but what kids want to do is hunker down in one spot and just tinker with it , just work with it , just pick it up , build a house , build a fort , do something like that .
Additionally , these sort of Edenic places are often distant from where people live .
And they're expensive to get to . They're hard to visit .
So this means that they're only available to the elites , and that's a real problem .
The Nature Conservancy did a survey of young people , and they asked them , how often do you spend time outdoors ?
And only two out of five spent time outdoors at least once a week .
The other three out of five were just staying inside .
And when they asked them why , what are the barriers to going outside , the response of 61 percent was , "There are no natural areas near my home" .
And this is crazy . This is just patently false .
I mean , 71 percent of people in the US live within a 10-minute walk of a city park .
And I'm sure the figures are similar in other countries .
And that doesn't even count your back garden , the urban creek , the empty lot .
Everybody lives near nature .
Every kid lives near nature .
We've just somehow forgotten how to see it .
We've spent too much time watching David Attenborough documentaries where the nature is really sexy - and we've forgotten how to see the nature that is literally right outside our door , the nature of the street tree .
So here's an example: Philadelphia .
There's this cool elevated railway that you can see from the ground , that's been abandoned .
Now , this may sound like the beginning of the High Line story in Manhattan , and it's very similar , except they haven't developed this into a park yet , although they're working on it .
So for now , it's still this little sort of secret wilderness in the heart of Philadelphia , and if you know where the hole is in the chain-link fence , you can scramble up to the top and you can find this completely wild meadow just floating above the city of Philadelphia .
Every single one of these plants grew from a seed This is completely autonomous , self-willed nature .
And it's right in the middle of the city .
And they've sent people up there to do sort of biosurveys , and there are over 50 plant species up there .
And it's not just plants .
This is an ecosystem , a functioning ecosystem .
It's creating soil . It's sequestering carbon .
There's pollination going on .
I mean , this is really an ecosystem .
So scientists have started calling ecosystems like these "novel ecosystems" , because they're often dominated by non-native species , and because they're just super weird .
They're just unlike anything we've ever seen before .
For so long , we dismissed all these novel ecosystems as trash .
We're talking about regrown agricultural fields , timber plantations that are not being managed on a day-to-day basis , second-growth forests generally , the entire East Coast , where after agriculture moved west , the forest sprung up .
And of course , pretty much all of Hawaii , where novel ecosystems are the norm , where exotic species totally dominate .
This forest here has Queensland maple , it has sword ferns from Southeast Asia .
You can make your own novel ecosystem , too . It's really simple .
You just stop mowing your lawn .
Ilkka Hanski was an ecologist in Finland , and he did this experiment himself .
He just stopped mowing his lawn , and after a few years , he had some grad students come , and they did sort of a bio-blitz of his backyard , and they found 375 plant species , including two endangered species .
So when you're up there on that future High Line of Philadelphia , surrounded by this wildness , surrounded by this diversity , this abundance , this vibrance , you can look over the side and you can see a local playground for a local school , and that's what it looks like .
You know , under my definition , there's a lot of the planet that counts as nature , but this would be one of the few places that wouldn't count as nature .
There's nothing there except humans , no other plants , no other animals .
And what I really wanted to do was just , like , throw a ladder over the side and get all these kids to come up with me into this cool meadow .
In a way , I feel like this is the choice that faces us .
If we dismiss these new natures as not acceptable or trashy or no good , we might as well just pave them over .
And in a world where everything is changing , we need to be very careful about how we define nature .
In order not to steal it from our children , we have to do two things .
First , we cannot define nature as that which is untouched .
This never made any sense anyway .
Nature has not been untouched for thousands of years .
And it excludes most of the nature that most people can visit and have a relationship with , including only nature that children cannot touch .
Which brings me to the second thing that we have to do , which is that we have to let children touch nature , because that which is untouched is unloved .
We face some pretty grim environmental challenges on this planet .
Climate change is among them .
There's others too: habitat loss is my favorite thing to freak out about in the middle of the night .
But in order to solve them , we need people - smart , dedicated people - who care about nature .
And the only way we're going to raise up a generation of people who care about nature is by letting them touch nature .
I have a Fort Theory of Ecology , Fort Theory of Conservation .
Every ecologist I know , every conservation biologist I know , every conservation professional I know , built forts when they were kids .
If we have a generation that doesn't know how to build a fort , we'll have a generation that doesn't know how to care about nature .
And I don't want to be the one to tell this kid , who is on a special program that takes Philadelphia kids from poor neighborhoods and takes them to city parks , I don't want to be the one to tell him that the flower he's holding is a non-native invasive weed that he should throw away as trash .
I think I would much rather learn from this boy that no matter where this plant comes from , it is beautiful , and it deserves to be touched and appreciated .
Thank you .
Gerard Ryle: How the Panama Papers journalists broke the biggest leak in history.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Gerard Ryle led the international team that divulged the Panama Papers , the 11 . 5 million leaked documents from 40 years of activity of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca that have offered an unprecedented glimpse into the scope and methods of the secretive world of offshore finance . Hear the story behind the biggest collaborative journalism project in history .
What do you do if you had to figure out the information behind 11 . 5 million documents , verify it and make sense of it ?
That was a challenge that a group of journalists had to face late last year .
An anonymous person calling himself John Doe had somehow managed to copy nearly 40 years of records of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca .
This is one of many firms around the world that specialize in setting up accounts in offshore tax havens like the British Virgin Islands , for rich and powerful people who like to keep secrets .
John Doe had managed to copy every spreadsheet from this firm , every client file , every email , from 1977 to the present day .
It represented the biggest cache of inside information into the tax haven system that anyone had ever seen .
But it also presented a gigantic challenge to investigative journalism .
Think about it: 11 . 5 million documents , containing the secrets of people from more than 200 different countries .
Where do you start with such a vast resource ?
Where do you even begin to tell a story that can trail off into every corner of the globe , and that can affect almost any person in any language , sometimes in ways they don't even know yet .
John Doe had given the information to two journalists at the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung .
He said he was motivated by - and I quote - "The scale of the injustice that the documents would reveal" .
But one user alone can never make sense of such a vast amount of information .
So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out to my organization in Washington , DC , The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists .
We decided to do something that was the very opposite of everything we'd been taught to do as journalists: share .
By nature , investigative reporters are lone wolves .
We fiercely guard our secrets , at times even from our editors , because we know that the moment we tell them what we have , they'll want that story right away .
And to be frank , when you get a good story , you like to keep the glory to yourself .
But there's no doubt that we live in a shrinking world , and that the media has largely been slow to wake up to this .
The issues we report on are more and more transnational .
Giant corporations operate on a global level .
Environmental and health crises are global .
So , too , are financial flows and financial crises .
So it seems staggering that journalism has been so late to cover stories in a truly global way .
And it also seems staggering that journalism has been so slow to wake up to the possibilities that technology brings , rather than being frightened of it .
The reason journalists are scared of technology is this: the profession's largest institutions are going through tough times because of the changing way that people are consuming news .
The advertising business models that have sustained reporting are broken .
And this has plunged journalism into crisis , forcing those institutions to reexamine how they function .
But where there is crisis , there is also opportunity .
The first challenge presented by what would eventually become known as the Panama Papers was to make the documents searchable and readable .
There were nearly five million emails , two million PDFs that needed to be scanned and indexed , and millions more files and other kinds of documents .
They all needed to be housed in a safe and secure location in the cloud .
We next invited reporters to have a look at the documents .
In all , reporters from more than 100 media organizations in 76 countries - from the BBC in Britain to Le Monde newspaper in France to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan .
"Native eyes on native names" , we called it , the idea being , who best to tell you who was important to Nigeria than a Nigerian journalist ?
Who best in Canada than a Canadian ?
There were only two rules for everyone who was invited: we all agreed to share everything that we found with everybody else , and we all agreed to publish together on the same day .
We chose our media partners based on trust that had been built up through previous smaller collaborations and also from leads that jumped out from the documents .
Over the next few months , my small nonprofit organization of less than 20 people was joined by more than 350 other reporters from 25 language groups .
The biggest information leak in history had now spawned the biggest journalism collaboration in history: 376 sets of native eyes doing what journalists normally never do , working shoulder to shoulder , sharing information , but telling no one .
For it became clear at this point that in order to make the biggest kind of noise , we first needed the biggest kind of silence .
To manage the project over the many months it would take , we built a secure virtual newsroom .
We used encrypted communication systems , and we built a specially designed search engine .
Inside the virtual newsroom , the reporters could gather around the themes that were emerging from the documents .
Those interested in blood diamonds or exotic art , for instance , could share information about how the offshore world was being used to hide the trade in both of those commodities .
Those interested in sport could share information about how famous sports stars were putting their image rights into offshore companies , thereby likely avoiding taxes in the countries where they plied their trade .
But perhaps most exciting of all were the number of world leaders and elect politicians that were emerging from the documents - figures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine , close associates of Vladimir Putin in Russia and the British Prime Minister , David Cameron , who is linked through his late father , Ian Cameron .
Buried in the documents were secret offshore entities , such as Wintris Inc . , a company in the British Virgin Islands that had actually belonged to the sitting Icelandic prime minister .
I like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson , the Icelandic reporter we invited to join the project , as the loneliest man in the world .
For nine months , he refused paid work and lived off the earnings of his wife .
He pasted tarps over the windows of his home to prevent prying eyes during the long Icelandic winter .
And he soon ran out of excuses to explain his many absences , as he worked red-eyed , night after night , month after month .
In all that time , he sat on information that would eventually bring down the leader of his country .
Now , when you're an investigative reporter and you make an amazing discovery , such as your prime minster can be linked to a secret offshore company , that that company has a financial interest in Icelandic banks - the very issue he's been elected on - well , your instinct is to scream out very loud .
Instead , as one of the few people that he could speak to , Johannes and I shared a kind of gallows humor .
"Wintris is coming" , he used to say .
We were big fans of "Game of Thrones" .
When reporters like Johannes wanted to scream , they did so inside the virtual newsroom , and then they turned those screams into stories by going outside the documents to court records , official company registers , and by eventually putting questions to those that we intended to name .
Panama Papers actually allowed the reporters to look at the world through a different lens from everybody else .
As we were researching the story , unconnected to us , a major political bribery scandal happened in Brazil .
A new leader was elected in Argentina .
The FBI began to indict officials at FIFA , the organization that controls the world of professional soccer .
The Panama Papers actually had unique insights into each one of these unfolding events .
So you can imagine the pressure and the ego dramas that could have ruined what we were trying to do .
Any of one of these journalists , they could have broken the pact .
But they didn't .
And on April 3 this year , at exactly 8pm German time , we published simultaneously in 76 countries .
The Panama Papers quickly became one of the biggest stories of the year .
This is the scene in Iceland the day after we published .
It was the first of many protests .
The Icelandic prime minister had to resign .
It was a first of many resignations .
We spotlighted many famous people such as Lionel Messi , the most famous soccer player in the world .
And there were some unintended consequences .
These alleged members of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested after we published details about their hideout .
They'd been using the address to register their offshore company .
There's a kind of irony in what we've been able to do .
The technology - the Internet - that has broken the business model is allowing us to reinvent journalism itself .
And this dynamic is producing unprecedented levels of transparency and impact .
We showed how a group of journalists can effect change across the world by applying new methods and old-fashioned journalism techniques to vast amounts of leaked information .
We put all-important context around what was given to us by John Doe .
And by sharing resources , we were able to dig deep - much deeper and longer than most media organizations allow these days , because of financial concerns .
Now , it was a big risk , and it wouldn't work for every story , but we showed with the Panama Papers that you can write about any country from just about anywhere , and then choose your preferred battleground to defend your work .
Try obtaining a court injunction that would prevent the telling of a story in 76 different countries .
Try stopping the inevitable .
Shortly after we published , I got a three-word text from Johannes: "Wintris has arrived" .
It had arrived and so , too , perhaps has a new era for journalism .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani: Gerard , thank you .
I guess you're going to send that applause to the 350 journalists who worked with you , right ?
Now , a couple of questions I would like to ask .
The first one is , you'd been working in secrecy for over a year with 350-something colleagues from all over the world - was there ever a moment when you thought that the leak may be leaked , that the collaboration may just be broken by somebody publishing a story ?
Or somebody not in the group releasing some information that they got to know ?
Gerard Ryle: We had a series of crises along the way , including when something major was happening in the world , the journalists from that country wanted to publish right away .
We had to calm them down .
Probably the biggest crisis we had was a week before publication .
We'd sent a series of questions to the associates of Vladimir Putin , but instead of responding , the Kremlin actually held a press conference and denounced us , and denounced the whole thing as being , I guess , a plot from the West .
At that point , Putin thought it was just about him .
And , of course , a lot of editors around the world were very nervous about this . They thought the story was going to get out .
You can imagine the amount of time they'd spent , the amount of resources , money spent on this .
So I had to basically spend the last week calming everyone down , a bit like a general , where you're holding your troops back: "Calm , remain calm" .
And then eventually , of course , they all did .
BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so , you released a lot of the documents as an open database for everybody to search via keyword , essentially .
GR: We very much believe that the basic information about the offshore world should be made public .
Now , we didn't publish the underlying documents of the journalists we're working with .
But the basic information such as the name of a person , what their offshore company was and the name of that company , is now all available online .
In fact , the biggest resource of its kind basically is out there now BG: Gerard , thank you for the work you do .
GR: Thank you .
