Tom and Mary told everybody that they'd gotten divorced, but they're actually still married.
Tom left the building.
Why don't you buy it?
I don't see the humor in anything.
Tom said he thought he could help us.
He made me sing.
Am I safe here?
The dentist told me to stay still.
The teacher wanted to know why we hadn't done the exercises.
That may not be necessary.
I guess that I'll have to do that.
Tom didn't say anything, did he?
You need to be extra careful around Tom.
I thought doing this would be easy, but we've been working all day and we're still not finished.
I bought an old car.
He's clearly intelligent.
Can't you see Tom is dying?
This is a pen.
Your car has a broken taillight.
Would you like to add me to your contact list?
My friend has been shot.
Tom asked for help.
It's very cold in my house.
Don't open the door.
The man I was waiting for didn't turn up.
My younger brother lives in Boston.
Did you hear what Tom did?
Tom shook my hand.
We'll get some more.
I'm sure you've heard about the fire.
The toilet is upstairs.
You're new here, aren't you?
Tom likes to talk about himself.
I'm sorry that I didn't buy that for you.
I don't feel sick.
You can hide in here.
I have to study this evening.
I'm such an idiot.
Tom was injured in a car accident.
You can do whatever you want to.
Who ate the bread?
Tom and Mary talked about sports.
I think that it's time for me to get a dog.
We didn't see any children at all.
I'm trying not to make Tom angry.
I need to call Tom.
He left just now.
Some people don't get along.
I'll take any job you can offer me.
Do you really hate Tom that much?
I searched in my pocket for a coin to make a phone call.
All the stores are closed.
There is no sign of life on Mars.
I'm looking for my ID.
Did Tom go to Boston with you?
Tom is a journalist.
I want to go abroad someday.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I sing almost every day.
I didn't know Tom knew Mary.
To my surprise, he refused my offer.
Stop screaming.
Close the safe.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
She is very pretty.
Everybody knows about that.
Tom bought a coat.
This is where you're supposed to sit.
Tom was quick to catch on.
She wanted him to sing her a song.
Where were those pictures taken?
Have you seen this video?

What is the language spoken in Brazil?
Did you learn that from Tom?
Tom drank a cup of coffee.

Everything faded into the background.
I suspected Tom was prejudiced.

I'm going to buy wine.
Can I use this dictionary?
I think that'll cover all Tom's expenses.
I want Tom to go.
Do you have a nickel?
Tom said he wasn't at home.
You shouldn't ask those kinds of questions.
Tom walked up to Mary and handed her something.
They have everything under control.
French is my mother tongue.
I'm the one who chose this color.
I'd like to know exactly how much money is in my account.
I wish that Tom wouldn't always talk about work.
There might be more butter in the refrigerator.
She suggested that I go to the store with him.
Tom came in last.
How much have you been paid so far?
Tom isn't mad at you either.
Did you advise him to go to the police?
Tom said it was my fault.
They plan to have a party.
Do you know what that is?
Is that all you have to do?
I'll be out of town for a few days.
She intended to go shopping.
I can't imagine doing it any other way.
Their divorce came as a complete surprise.
It's nothing.
Are you going to do something about that?
There's nothing here.
Tom gave me his address.
Tom and his friends discussed politics all night.
You'd better let Tom do that for you.
I bought a new umbrella.
Tom should've bought one.
We'll see who answers first.
Blackboards are not always black.
Tom should've done that with me.
The washing machine is making a strange sound.
Tom felt like giving up.
Tom didn't see anything.
She was humiliated by him.
Try to be generous and forgive.
How much was the discount?
I told him about our school.
Her bathing suit attracts our attention.
What can I use?
Can we do this again?
It's mine.
I enjoy chess.
Will you marry me?
I no longer live in the same neighborhood.
When will you return to Boston?
What do we need that for?
What exactly is it you want me to do?
Do you consider yourself beautiful?
Tom shouldn't be the head coach.
I used to work in a supermarket.
I don't trust these surveys.
It's your fault.
You can't blame yourself.
You'll learn how to do that in time.
Get to the point.
Go say hi to Tom.
I was reading a letter when he entered.
I've decided not to go to Australia with you.
Never mind!
I think that Tom is at least partially to blame.
I'm going to do that right away.
Tom is paying attention.
Tom is asking for the impossible.
I'm flustered.
I forgot to tell you the babysitter's name.
It isn't raining anymore.
Are you going or not?
I need a lot of books.
Take a book and read it.
You shouldn't take the things Tom says seriously.
I'm never angry without reason.
They consider him a hero.
If you have something to say, say it now or pipe down.
He crossed the river in a small boat.
How does gravity work?
Do you have much money with you?
I can't tell you how that happened.
You look fine, Tom.
Do you want to have a cup of tea?
Tom went to the theater with Mary.
I forgot my purse.
I'm not as enthusiastic about doing that as Tom is.
I own an electric guitar.
He stuck out his tongue at his teacher.
Aren't you tired of me yet?
I'm so happy we understand each other.
Tom will probably be busy on Monday.
When did you begin studying French?
Tom ordered the same thing I did.
Don't hate me.
I'm also thinking of going to Australia.
Tom climbed over the fence.
That sounds like a good idea.
It seems perfect.
I didn't come here to talk about my problems.
I think Tom does that.
The ship wasn't ready for battle.
When did you return?
They all cried out together.
I always eat out.
I'm just a little dizzy.
I need to read more books.
Tom caused this.
Tom scanned the QR code with his phone.
I'd been incarcerated before.
Who's coming with me?
I rode my bicycle a lot today.
Just be yourself.
I'm sure that I told you about that.
Why are you asking me these questions?
Why's Tom lying to me?
I've worked in Australia.
I didn't think that you'd be late.
I think I missed my bus.
I am in agreement with most of what he says.
This is one of the best dictionaries I have.
Tom tripped over something.
I returned to Australia on October 20th.
Did you buy the computer you were looking at?
Do you still let Tom do that?
She didn't intend to let him drive.
I said that I'll do that for you.
Tom tried not to make eye contact with Mary.
You don't know Tom, do you?
When are you going to the library?
I just found out about that an hour ago.
The feeling is mutual.
The tea is too strong. Add a bit of water.
Open your suitcase.
It was strange.
I want this to be yours.
Learning French is useful.
Tom isn't innocent anymore.
It's difficult to do that.
He lost his way in the woods.
I want what you promised.
Tom doesn't know when Mary will arrive.
You'll see it for yourself.
I can hardly remember anything.
I wasn't prepared.
Tom said he wasn't in a hurry.
Tom is upstairs with the children.
Mary can dance well.
Who would want to kill me?
Do you know when Tom graduated from college?
There's no mistake.
That's hogwash.
It's possible.
Tom is captain of the football team and is on the baseball team as well.
Who's going to tell Tom he can't go with us?
Tom wanted to know what happened.
We set a trap to catch a fox.
Tom said you have my keys.
He had heard wonderful stories about cities of gold with silver trees.
It's Tom's turn to wash the dishes.
What's the best way to learn French?
What're you doing?
Close the door, please.
We need a leader.
You play a musical instrument, don't you?
I asked him to start at once.
Drive safely.
There are only two correct answers.
Let's eat somewhere else.
Tom smokes a lot.
How tall you are!
This isn't new.
She doesn't have as much patience as you do.
I've always wanted to learn how to ride a horse.
This door leads to the garden.
I'm pretty sure that Tom won't win.
Is it all right if we smoke here?
I ordered a glass of wine.
Help me!
What time does the next train leave?
Has Tom arrived?
I need his help.
Tom plans to buy another car.
I am a teacher of English.
I love visiting Boston.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
Are you lost?
All of us know Tom.
What's your biggest fear?
Weekends are very busy.
Why do you love me?
Tom's voice is unmistakable.
I often play tennis with Tom on Mondays.
This door is locked from the inside.
Can we talk about this after lunch?
Where is your house?
Those are the children you'll be giving the book to.
He was so angry he couldn't speak.
I have some problems to take care of.
I'd love to visit Boston.
This is our problem.
After a certain point, everything became a little more difficult.
Tom left his door unlocked.
Please make sure your username and password are correct.
I did everything I could to help Tom, and this is how he repays me.
May I try on this jacket?
Tom probably did that on October 20th.
I wanted to buy that painting.
I've done the same thing myself.
I nearly did that this morning.
Tom didn't say how much it cost.
I'm not tall.
Tom sliced the ham.
It's very important that you understand me.
I want Tom to know that.

Take mine.
I'm not going to do that with Tom.
I managed to crack the code.
Tom took his pants off.
Do you know where he could have hidden his money?
You're freaking me out.
Tom studied abroad.
I thought that you'd be in Boston this week.
You shouldn't pick your nose in public.
We've had lots of typhoons this fall.
I was born in Boston in 2013.
Tom trusted them.
Do it right away.
I showed him my room.
I'd rather not spend so much money on clothes.
The cost of the book is five dollars.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting for such a long time.
I really hope that this helps.
You can't control me.
Tom is Mary's ex-boyfriend's brother.
I was lucky.
There are frequently earthquakes in Japan.
I'm almost sure that's the way it happened.
What are you guys looking at?
It's warm today, isn't it?
We need to hire three more drivers.
I think Tom will be hesitant to do that.
I don't want to hurt Tom, but I will if I have to.
Tom refused to shake Mary's hand.
I didn't expect all this.
Maybe it will be exactly the same for him.
I knew we should've stayed in Boston.
I hope Tom doesn't get frightened.
He promised the slaves that they would be freed.
People change.
When did Tom decide to do that?
I would like to visit you.
We've had good luck with it.
I like doing this.
I don't care about anybody else.
Tom concentrated on his work.
She was advised by him to go abroad while she was still young.
It'll probably take you about three hours to do that.
I doubt if Tom will be through doing that yet.
She doesn't need to work.
Why's everyone still standing?
I'd like to go along if it's OK with you.
Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
I assume you're talking about Tom.
Help us.

What were you hoping to find?
What will you do now?

These shoes don't fit me anymore.
We've missed our train.
What do you love? What do you hate?
Tom bought every single one of them.
Tom and I are working.
You can't say no.
The speaker should stand where everyone can see him.
I just found out that you used to live in Australia.
What shall we do today?
I can't help you because I'm busy.
I shouldn't have gone to Boston.
That worried me.

You're three hours late.
Forget it.

Tom and John are good friends.
Are you going to eat those eggs?
It is getting darker and darker.
Are you satisfied?
I'm up here.
We're enemies.
It's on its way.
I don't let Tom play outside.
"Do you want a drink?" "No, thanks. I'm driving."
We started from scratch.
They hate me.
Tom's office doesn't look like mine at all.
Is eating raw eggs safe?
I can't drink coffee.
Tom didn't need a bigger office.
There is a melon on the table.
Tom arrives today.
If it weren't for my advice, you would have failed.

We'll go in.
Tom didn't like Mary at that time.
Did you already know that?
Tom never told me why he had decided to become a teacher.
Tom threw a rock at the tree.
It's a good idea to wash new clothes before wearing them.
Get out of here right away.
Tom wasn't the only one who laughed.
I handled it.
I wasn't flirting.
Tom will understand.
I don't want to sit down.
I wanted to talk to my children.
Team members are provided with equipment and uniforms.
It won't be possible.
I shut the door behind me.
I hurt my right foot.
I didn't catch the last word.
Please make sure.
I was awakened at five o'clock.
Have you found someone to replace Tom?
I'll always need you.
I may never see you again.
Tom has a message for you.
This furniture belongs to my mom.
Mother has just gone shopping.
Are those my slippers?
Give me the book.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
We're sorry we can't help you.
How can I see you?
Why were you angry with me?
He finally decided to propose to her.
Why did you interrupt us?

I went, too.
We're everywhere.
What do you want an empty shoe box for?
This is a view of the Alps.
Isn't it Tuesday?
Don't make fun of foreigners.
I wasn't rich enough to do that.
If I'd only known that there was a possibility that would happen, I'd have been more careful.
We have someone else to do this.
Tom is looking at you.
I think that Tom and Mary are in trouble.
Answer the phone.
Tom won't come tomorrow.
I think this is mine.
Thank you for supporting me.
The friend of my enemy is my enemy.
I don't want to work here anymore.
I'm not accustomed to such treatment.
You stink.
Tom knew Mary was worried.
It seems that the computer was infected by a virus.
She bought a handkerchief for ten dollars.
Tom was satisfied with Mary's answers.
My mom married young.
I wanted to work for Tom.
You did that last night, didn't you?
I don't know whether he'll come by train or by car.
Tom drove faster.
It was hot last night.
I wonder if Mary has a boyfriend.
I need to find a place to live.
There's no one named Tom here.
What should I buy Tom for Christmas?
I don't yet know what I'm going to do.
I just didn't want you to go there by yourself.

Will you please call me this evening?
Tom acted without thinking.
He ran into debt.
Tom shut himself up in his bedroom.
Tom is worried about what might happen.
Tom isn't going to argue.
I haven't bought any Christmas presents.
You're not very busy, are you?
Tom's sister is younger than mine.
I've read many kinds of books.
They speak English in Australia.
That's basically what we want.
What do you desire?
Will you make coffee for me?
Don't try to leave town.
I won't ever let Tom do that again.
Where was Tom?
Tom is a shy and lonely boy.
Tom changed.
I'm almost finished writing the report.
I said go home.
It's not a virus.
His dream came true.
Study in the cool of the morning.
Would you care if Tom did that?
I usually sit in the back.
Do you run every day?
It's monkey meat.
Tom should've gone to Boston with Mary.
He was out of breath when he got here.
It's still being tested.
I don't care how you do it. Just do it.
They've had plenty of time.
The children were playing in the backyard.
I needed this.
Tom told me he was ready.

I might do that tomorrow.
This is expensive.
I think it's time for me to go.
Tom is coming back here to pick me up.
We've had a lot of bad luck.
This book was printed in England.
I'm bushed.
We need more time to come up with a plan.
Sorry, I'm probably going to be about 20 minutes late.
I don't know how to do it.
Tom doesn't know that he's adopted.
What time will you leave?
She always keeps her room clean.
It hardly ever rains here.
How much does a beer cost?
Mary is a model.
Tom wished he had a decent job.
Tom didn't win the prize.
Did Tom vote?
I look forward to seeing them this spring.
There were no computers in the office.
In any case, I've already entirely forgiven you.
He was destined to become a great musician.
Does that make you feel any better?
Where did you go today?
We aren't going to lose.
I'm going to the garage.
We should definitely meet again soon.
The storm became even more violent.
I've never been abroad before.
Are they worth it?
I don't know who the man is.
This will be extremely helpful.
I didn't know that Tom used to be a policeman.
I thought it was Tom.
Do you recognize this T-shirt?
Which book did you read?
Suddenly Tom began to cry.
Although he is very old, he is strong.
Who's that with Tom?
I don't like this shirt. Please show me another one.

Tom doesn't need to go to the doctor.
She's curious to find out who sent the flowers.
Who'll pay the bill?
Tom wasn't in any hurry to do that.
Aren't you going to eat breakfast?
I want Tom to help me clean the living room.
I feel fine today.
He was playing the piano and she was singing.
Today is my sister's birthday.
You look like you're about to cry.
It was true that she had gotten married twice.
I didn't even see you once last year.
Tom left the radio on.
I'm sorry, I really messed up.
Why do you think so?
I saw her yesterday.
My cough got worse.
Tom said he's pessimistic.
We aced the exam.
I can't make myself understood in French.
Tom was very delighted with your gift.
Are you getting tired?
Tom took his children to see the waterfall.
This isn't a bad thing.
When is your birthday?
I think that you should go to college.
I thought you hated me.
I didn't know you were interested in antiques.
He adopted the orphan.
It'll be OK.

Whose newspaper is this?
Have some coffee.
The old dog barked.
You ought to have a carpenter's square.
You can't stop me from doing that.
Both of my parents are dead.
Here he is!
They never did what they said they would do.
I'm standing.
It's up to you.
I have nothing left to lose.
I'd like to change some money.
That's a fish.
I wasn't the one driving the car.
Tom didn't go home.
I hope you enjoy your flight.
What's your favorite poem?
I'm going to drop in on her next week.
I'm sure Tom will be arrested.
I haven't forgotten you.
Tom is planning a surprise party for Mary.
I've been reading a lot.
Tom would be forgiven if he did that.

I'm pretty satisfied.
He's at home right now.
I caught five fish yesterday.
I was on my way home.
Tom tuned his guitar.
We went out.
Tom fell asleep quickly.
We've still got time.
This bicycle is mine. Yours is over there.
Tom doesn't want to go to sleep.
Learning to drive requires a lot of practice.
There's no need to ask for permission.
I'd like a car like yours.
That tie really suits you.
Today is Thursday.
Why are you wearing my coat?
I'm worried about Tom, too.
It's a bitter pill to swallow.
Although it rained, everyone had a good time.
Everything is fine.
I like skiing very much.
I want to know if you're planning on going to Australia with us next month.
Tom has already been arrested at least three times.
His room was brightly lit.
I don't want to lose you.
Is this a challenge?
We played on the same soccer team.

Tom took off his glasses.
I hate quarreling.
Tom looked at the moon.
Tom wrote it down.
Do you like horses?
Tom said he was afraid of heights.
Help me with my tie.
We're both crazy.
That's what we want.
I've got an idea.
We're going for a walk in the park.
Tom and I bought our plane tickets three months in advance.
We must try.
Are you sure this is going to work?
Count me in.
Tom wants to eat some ice cream.
Tom seemed uninterested.
That was my fault.
I don't know what that means.
It was a good movie.
I left home at 2:30.
They went to the United States last month.
Now, why didn't I think of that?
I wonder what all of them have in common.
I've already told Tom what he should buy.
That's not correct.
You can come with me.

Do you believe that animals have souls?
I have four aces.
Let's see if this makes sense.
A dove is a symbol of peace.
The child almost drowned.

Tom is the boss right now.
Whose wine is this?
It's time to be going.

Tom has spent time in Australia.
I'm sorry to say I don't remember your name.
Tell Tom how to get to your house.
I met Tom at the library.
If it rains tomorrow, we'll stay at home.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I like brunettes.
In other words, he is a lazy person.
Are you acquainted with that man?
Mary is beautiful.
Tom is buying a computer.
Don't worry. My lips are sealed.
I never believed that.
He complained about the noise.
Let me show you a better way do that.
I am near the station.
Do you have plans for tomorrow?
Can't someone fix this?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Tom won't tell me why Mary isn't here.
Do you like this?
Don't forget to bring a camera.
I did my homework yesterday.
I'll never come back.
What are your thoughts on that?
Be careful with that thing.
You are too sensitive to criticism.
How many hospitals are there in Boston?
Tom was in Boston in 2003.
This is a coincidence.
Here's the book that you wanted to read.
I've seen Tom dance many times.
What's your son's name?
I don't feel like doing that.
Tom has always been a musician.
There's no need to worry.
Does anyone want some more pie?
This isn't your hat, is it?
How much is it?
These are our kids.
I like that tie of yours.
My bicycle's been stolen.
Nothing is achieved without effort.
Tom is drinking with Mary.
Why are you singing?
I have very few books in English.
Come swim with me.
Does Tom smoke a lot?
How're they doing that?
They told me that Tom had already left.
Tom is the one who takes out the garbage.
I'm just calling to say hi.
I don't get you.
I'll make sure Tom writes to you.
I should've paid closer attention.
Hey, wait a minute.
Tom is a stubborn guy.
I promise that won't happen again.
I drank two cups of coffee.
Clean up your own mess.
That movie wasn't as interesting as I thought it was going to be.
I'll kill it.
Boston is the city that I like best.
Tom, are you asleep?
Are you sure Tom is alone?
Tom doesn't understand any French.
We are rarely satisfied with what we already have.
Tom is a freshman.
Which reminds me, it's been more than 30 years since that incident.
When was the last time you parked your car here?
Where are we going?
Do you keep all the promises you make?
Tom became a Japanese citizen.
Both of them are teachers.
This medicine tastes bitter.
How many people did you invite to your party?
The Swiss consume a large amount of beer.
We don't know where Tom is, but we need to find him as soon as we can.
Maybe I can do it again.
I noted a trace of eagerness in her voice.
The dog wants to go outside.
She seems to be a good cook.
Did you get wet?
We should've listened to you, Tom.
Whose coat is this?
When I came home, I felt very hungry.
I had a good time this evening.
Tom was the first.
He should come.
He has a white dog.
I had a good time yesterday evening.
I feel like things are getting better.
This tea smells good.
He lives outside the city.
Let's see if I can convince Tom to do the job.
I know you know I know.
It makes me very happy.
I'm not going to deny that.
Where are your parents now?
The door won't open.
I think I'll give Tom an egg timer.
Tom wrote an article for the school newspaper.
I would like to rent a car.
Tom won't permit anyone to do that.
That's the house I stayed in.
I teased Tom.
Can I come with you?
Tom likes helping others.
My prayer was answered.
Tom was really glad to hear that Mary had passed her exams.
I had a very weird dream.
Keep writing.
Tom is a country boy.
Italy isn't Greece.
Let's call it a night.
I'll do what I can.
I can't eat.
He visited many countries in Asia.
Just give it a shot.
I wonder what happened to Tom and Mary.
Tom said he wanted to go to Boston.
Start here.
This is tasteless.
I hope Tom sees this.
You've got two choices.
I don't know who won.
We don't need to hire anyone.
Thanks for opening the door.
What do they mean?
Tom didn't want to leave his dog with me.
You're always complaining about your husband.
Tom and Mary took turns driving.
We talked about this when it happened.
The landlord says he wants to raise the rent.
How did you know Tom would be in Boston?
Tom won't study with us.
I dream of going to Australia.
Don't fire anyone.
Tom tried to keep up with Mary.
You're useless.
We've had some tough times.
My kid was in the car.
That book is familiar to all young children.
I decided to be a lawyer.
Thanks a lot for helping me today.
Tom was questioned by the police.
What if I am poor?
Mary told me that she didn't love her husband anymore.
Tom is the oldest of Mary's three children.
A true friend would not say such a thing.
That'll be nice.
I got scared.
He likes sleeping.
You obviously don't know Tom very well.
Whatever you do, don't do that with Tom.
I think something is wrong.
Tom doesn't need to do that right away.
Everybody knew Tom was lying.
It is about ten minutes' walk to the station.
Can you go with us?
I don't deserve anything.
I've never eaten Chinese food before.
I know that you're busy, but I could use some help.
Tom whispered.
They won't stop.
Which one will he choose?
How did you start working in Australia?
Have him come.
Did you do that for me?
I'll make sure Tom writes to you.
Enjoy your meal!
Look at what I did.
Tom wouldn't cry.
His mother is worried sick about him.
Tom had no choice.
How is it going with Tom?
The dog growled when we approached.
Restart your computer.
Tom may be a Canadian.
The sea is blue.
I wonder how that happened.
I didn't get there in time.
Did you watch the press conference?
Tell Tom that you love him before it's too late.
There's something very wrong here.
What happened in Boston?
I must get this work finished by next Tuesday.
I would like to speak English fluently.
Tom and Mary spent the day together.
Where are they sending us?
Are you sure Tom will be there?
Tom is going to be a father soon.
I returned from Australia on October 20th.
It rained a lot that winter.
We're staying.
I'd like to work at a hospital.
I have no time.
Are you still smarter than your children?
Tom and Mary had a big fight.
I don't care, OK?
That's mine.
How many boys are there in the room?
I want to apologize to everyone here.
I think Tom would like to know that you're planning to do that.
My father doesn't like music.
Can we do it before Monday?
I have all the time in the world.
Tom is painting the house himself.
Tom speaks two foreign languages.
You didn't bring your guitar, did you?
Tom is in a meeting.
He explained the literal meaning of the sentences.
The only person Tom likes is Mary.
I'm a truck driver.
It's too thin.
I called Tom a few more times.
I think you'd like it there.
Do you have any appointments tomorrow?
I think that I've made my point.
I know Tom is furious.
I've never lied to you.
Tom yelled for help.
Have you thought this through?
How many countries are there in Asia?
I want another chance.
Tom walked across the garden.
What difference would it make?
Stop being so nosy.
Did we do the right thing?
Tom's thrilled.
I like coffee much more than tea.
I came to ask you something.
I am very tired when I get home at night.
Our bad luck was temporary.
I don't want to listen to you complain.
I know Tom snores.
What does Tom want to say to Mary?
I like to travel.
I can't fix all of these problems, but I can fix some of the problems.
I like reading Tom's blog.
I bump into Tom from time to time.
I didn't want to scare you.
I sat on the floor.
It isn't as easy as it sounds.
I don't sleep much.
This is really cool.
I knew that Tom was there.
I thought it was a very bad idea.
You must do what Tom tells you to do.
His new book met with a favorable reception.
Tom doesn't want you to do that.
I have to work this afternoon.
We must cancel our trip to Japan.
I will lend you money just this once.
We made you a cake.
I'm going to the movies.
We're not happy.
At last, the bus stopped.
We should probably talk about that.
He's popular with the students.
Tom waited outside.
I almost forgot it.
Can you speak French, too?
Who'll sit in the back?
Tom was with his girlfriend.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
You can have my sandwich.
I had good reasons to do that.
I asked him to send us the book.
Tom kept his mouth shut.
Tom told me you were in Boston.
I know I have to be patient.
Wash the apple before you eat it.
Tom looked at the picture.
Would you like a taste?
I think that it's time to give up.
I'm bigger than you.
Our new car is not very big.
You're going to freeze to death.
I need you in the garage right now.
When's the next shuttle?
Tom was really annoyed.
The dog chewed on one of Tom's tennis shoes.
The police arrested the suspect.
Is Tom still working?
Is there anybody here you don't know?
I burned myself.
Don't stare.
I don't know what we'll do.
It was difficult.
We were playing chess.
Tom doesn't think Mary's plan is feasible.
How are things going?
Tom has overstayed his visa.
I would like to rent a car.
I've never been so embarrassed in my life.
Tom doesn't look angry.
Why did you fry only one egg?
I went to work by car.
I can't forgive you.
Do you like hiking?
He seated himself on the bench.
Are you suggesting it might not have been an accident?
You're going to need one.
I have a throbbing headache.
Do you have any more?
She did her best to help him.
We needed time.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I plan on doing that by myself.
I'm afraid that you can't.
Tom milked the cow.
"Why didn't you tell me anything?" "I didn't want to upset you."
You must be sad as you have lost one of your friends.
Are you sure that you want to know?
I need to find work.
Tom said that he doesn't think you have to do that.
What was the problem?
Let me know when you will arrive at the airport.
Tom was wearing his uniform.
Do you like going to concerts?
Tom won't have to help me.
I need a bath.
Has Tom gone?
She put the key in her pocket.
I almost never watch TV.
I want this one myself.
We aren't Canadians.
She said something to him.
I don't know how Tom ever stood it.
Have you ever seen an elephant?
Hello, girls.
Why didn't anyone warn me?
I prefer a simpler approach.
Nobody loves me.
Help me, please.
It has already happened.
Tom told Mary that he thought John was really stressed out.
Perhaps I should leave.
Tom can't taste the difference between expensive wine and cheap wine.
I watch television every day.
The town was destroyed by the flood after the storm.
Tom brought Mary some juice.
It is very simple.
Did you see Tom leave?
What does Tom have to do?
I don't want to work in a company that doesn't care about its employees.
Study harder.
I want to know who gave that to you.
We don't need you anymore.
Where do you want to go, then?
You have to wear a helmet to protect your head.
You don't need to stand up.
Tom lost his money, his family and his friends.
Have you ever had a dream about me?
Stand at ease!
It's extremely cold today.
I'm a bit drunk.
Were you the one who chose this?
Why are you protecting Tom?
They are talking about what they will sing.
Tom really enjoyed the party.
Tom is a person I admire.
The king abused his power.
We're from Australia.
I think I'm going to get fired.
Tom was very immature.
She is about to leave.
Tom walks too slow.
I told you I don't know.
I need to sit down.
They're Canadians.
It can be tedious.
Maybe Tom will wait for us.
You'll get lost.
I heard the sound of a ringing bell.
Are you sure you don't want to wait for Tom?
He lives far away from his hometown.
Give me a hand.
Do you care what other people think about you?
Tom cried like a little baby.
Tell Tom where you went.
The machine has stopped functioning.
Do you know what you're doing?
Tom was cranky, but Mary wasn't.
How did you find us?
Tom plans to stay with us when he comes to Boston.
You made an error.
Tom didn't remember.
Who is younger, Tom or Mary?
I like meat, cheese and tomato sandwiches.
What does Tom want with me?
You require medical attention.
I spent the afternoon cleaning my office.
Do you have insurance?
He may not be happy.
I accept that.
Tom dislocated his shoulder.
You're quite safe.
I'll introduce you to the team.
Tom wasn't jumping on the bed.
This hat will suit her.
Can you tell me why we need to do this?
Turn it off, Tom.
Why did Tom hit me?
I didn't have enough money to buy that.
We can get you help.
Do you have fresh strawberries?
I was just about to say the same thing.
Schools will be closed today.
Everyone is against me.
Tom said he felt really threatened.
I plan to emigrate to Australia.
You were late yesterday.
I'm three years older than you are.
I'm not sneezing as much as I'd expected.
Are you telling me that I'm going to be all right?
Where is this going?
Tom is going to have to talk to Mary.
This shouldn't happen.
I'll give you five minutes.
The girl was afraid to jump down from the roof.
Don't stay here waiting for that to happen.
I see a bird on the roof.
I don't have to study tonight. I think I'll watch television for a while.
Tom did what most people would've done in the same situation.
It's breathtaking.
Tom gets good grades in French.
He likes this guitar.
She is a kind girl.
He apologized to the employee.
I'll never stop.
Because of the storm, we had no choice but to stay at home.
The battery on my cell phone is running low.
You're ugly.
It is up to you.
She used to play basketball.
Everybody desires happiness.
You don't need to do that if you don't want to.
Look at that.
I just want to sleep.
Tom will get back home on October 20th.
I know the name of this animal.
Do you know who that man is?
Tom took out the trash.
Who's in there with you?
There's nobody in the house.
Even though Tom is my neighbor, I don't know him very well.
It's not really my cup of tea.
Tom told me I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I'm feeling nervous.
Do you know how to get to Tom's house from here?
That's water under the bridge.
We'll wait outside.
The clock on the wall is slow.
Aren't you Tom's mother?
I don't like the house he lives in.
What are you talking about?
I don't know who the author is, but I loved what I read.
She took a flower from the vase and held it out to me.
Do you have enough money for the trip?
Please tell me how to get to the station.
Have you heard the news yet?
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
I can't forget his kindness.
Tom looked angry when Mary said that.
I sliced the onions.
I probably won't walk to school today.
The world is full of fools.
Tom would like to speak to you in private.
You should trust Tom more.
I'm good at skiing.
They hate me.
What else do you want me to say?
We need to wait here.
I don't like to be disturbed.
I have to take Tom to a doctor.
Tom and Mary are friends.
What time is lunch?
Isn't that what you said?
Tom looks tired today.
The cats are purring.
I seldom win.
I need a bucket.
I'm feeling bad.
I learned to drive three months ago.
I am not interested.
What's wrong with you?
Mary is wearing a new dress.
How long is this bridge?
I wish we'd invited Tom, too.
I took a swig of whiskey.
Didn't you use to have a car?
I'm wide awake now.
Allow me to go.
I didn't tell Tom why.
Tom doesn't want to wait.
Where on earth did you go last night?
I'm the world champion now.
Tom wasn't sure how to reply.
I could still change my mind.
What's the strangest thing you've ever eaten?
I wonder who taught Tom French.
Thank you very much for your hospitality today.
Has the snow already melted?
The word "the" is optional in this sentence.
Who's that girl waving at me?
Tom didn't have a good day.
I'm in Boston.
Don't smoke.
Be careful!
What kind of fuel do you use in this machine?
I feel like I'm making progress.
I don't need any of this stuff.
I wonder why Tom is so scared.
We didn't permit Tom to do that.
The ground seems wet.
I don't want to go to school.
Do I have a choice?
I don't think Tom knows whether it's true or not.
I find this very annoying.
They shook hands with each other.
I told a bedtime story to my daughter.
I've studied French for three years.
No one doubted that.
How do you know Tom won't want Mary to do that?
We found one.
I thought Tom would enjoy the party.
I thought you wouldn't recognize me.
Accidents are inevitable.
I took a deep breath.
I love working in Australia.
This book is new.
Tom is an intern.
He's about to finish reading the book.
Do you want to stay here all day?
I love your sense of humor.
Would you like to go for a walk?
French is my second language.
Do you believe in reincarnation?
I never worked with Tom.
Don't forget what I told you.
I want to stay as long as I can.
Tom won't tell us.
Tom auditioned for a role in the school play.
You have no choice.
Tom didn't want Mary to get hurt.
I'm ready to follow you.
Tom thought Mary was desperate to do that.
I'm becoming a real man.
I woke up after midnight.
It hardly ever rains here.
We know Tom is here.
Tom washed his clothes.
Tom put his house up for sale.
May I play the piano?
This is a joke.
Tom asked Mary how to get to her house.
Three years have passed since he died.
Fight like a man!
Come with me to Boston.
I can't concentrate.
I arrived safely.
Tom was actually there.
I decided to study every day.
He hardly ever works.
Where are your parents?
You were singing.
Are you going to stand there all day?
It is not good for a scientist to get emotional.
That was the intent.
He swims like a fish.
He has a strong personality.
Whose books are those?
Tom spends a lot of time in his room.
Tom wrote Mary a love letter.
Many people think that children don't spend enough time playing outside.
We've always been friends.
Tom screamed something in French.
We need to fix that.
I can't read this.
Why do people dye their hair?
I don't know where Tom will live next year.
Is it still raining?
Get out of here as soon as possible.
The man you met yesterday was Tom Jackson.
Tom was married, but he didn't wear a ring.
Tom will be staying here with us for three months.
"I am a teacher." "So am I."
What do you want?
I heard that Tom is back in town.
Didn't you have a plan?
This place isn't as safe as it used to be.
Tom opened the envelope.
Both girls coughed at the same time.
You speak French, right?
Watch my back.
Mary is a very shy girl.
She treated him like a king.
Don't you know what this is?
We knew you'd come.
I like what I've seen so far.
How do we do it?
Who lives in that house?
Tom is in the waiting room, isn't he?
Tom knew that I wouldn't do that.
Transplants save lives.
"Why did you do that?" "I had no choice."
Tom said Mary didn't have a dog.
My neck is stiff.
We'll never use those.
He became a nice young man.
We'll attack.
I'll write you or call you next week.
She went blind.
Do you want to go right now?
Why are you afraid?
Tom's dog was barking at Mary.
He seems happy.
I'm completely exhausted.
The intersection where the accident happened is near here.
Which factory was it?
Just look at what Tom has done.
Can I do this?
It's useless to talk to her. She won't listen to you.
Would you like to go play with Tom?
Everybody is excited.
The prince asked the little girl why she was crying.
Tom isn't very competitive.
I've never been this happy before.
What do you think you'd do?
Please stop walking.
I asked him where he was going.
Do you live here?
We used to have noisy neighbors.
She presented him with the trophy.
I don't like it when people make fun of me.
Tom laid down the gun on the floor.
Tom will be glad to see you.
Do you want a cab?
I'm younger than you.
How many times have you been burgled?
Tom wants Mary.
It took me three years to build my house.
Tom goes to Boston every once in a while.
I do that this way.
I have my own bedroom.
Don't you think that we can do it?
I found that his house was on fire.
How would you like to go to Australia with us next summer?
I'll help Tom.
I wasn't yelling.
He dislocated his shoulder.
You'll regret that!
Tom is looking good today.
Tom asked me if Mary was here.
She gave him a slap in the face.
That's the plan.
Tom didn't want to continue the conversation.
I never knew Tom.
You'd better come with me.
I want ice cream.
What did Tom do?
Tom uses a wheelchair.
I didn't say I liked Tom.
Take this box down to the basement.
Do you know who lives in that house?
Tom loved bananas.
I explained the rule to him.
It rained all last week.
Ask Mary out.
Tom wasn't planning to help, but Mary was.
Christmas is a special holiday.
If both Tom and Mary go to prison, who'll take care of their children?
Tom is an atheist.
The success of her novel made her rich.
How did you learn how to speak French so well?
It's a fantastic story.
I was out all day.
That's what Tom said to Mary.
As far as I know, Tom isn't married.
The exhibition was very impressive.
What you spend time doing in your childhood affects the rest of your life.
Tom's trial is set to start on Monday.
Tom declined my invitation.
Everybody in the building felt the earthquake.
Tom knew he'd probably said too much.
I just hope I don't sound stupid.
Tom and Mary are planning to move to Boston.
You don't realize how lucky you are.
It's dinner time.
Another day has begun.
You wouldn't do that again, would you?
I was interrogated.
I won't assist you.
We demand justice.
We're going to leave tomorrow.
Tom told me that he wasn't angry.
Where did you take those pictures?
Tom taught me how to cook.
What about you?
I don't know anything yet.
Be confident.
Are you a Republican?
I ran into my aunt by chance in Europe.
Is Mary your daughter?
We're your friends.
I think this is the best meal I've ever eaten.
I doubt it's possible.
Wear a blue dress.
I want you to be with me.
Tom doesn't want to go to Boston with me.
Mary will do anything she can to help Tom.
I live in a small town.
What you just said isn't relevant.
What's your nickname?
Something's wrong.
What does that have to do with it?
Let me introduce you to my beautiful wife.
Everything was created by God.
How did you lose your job?
Tom acted as if he knew nothing.
Tom walks his dog in the park almost every day.
I need a place to stay for a while.
Make sure you wear eye protection.
Tom has a plane to catch.
This shirt isn't clean.
This wine tastes awful.
How much does he earn in a month?
I really don't envy you.
Don't sign the contract in pencil.
Why do you ask?
Is it next Monday that Tom returns?
We're joking.
Look at the sky.
She looked excited.
How is that spelled?
I did everything you asked.
My father died when the cherry blossoms were at their best.
Tom kicked his son out of the house.
What's this used for?
Satellite imagery is being used in an effort to narrow down the area in the Indian Ocean where floating debris has been observed.
I think Tom won't be interested.
Tom doesn't need to do this.
Tom is playing.
What did you think Tom would do?
Are you sleeping in here?
My parents worry about my health.
The police officer put handcuffs on Tom.
We're all single.
I trust absolutely no one.
I think that Tom is talented.
Look at the picture on the wall.
I didn't want to talk to Tom about work.
Must this letter be written in English?
I do want it.
I don't want to fire you.
That happened to you because you weren't careful.
Did I miss something?
You live and learn.
I've changed.
I can't work with you.
I'm not going back.
I've never played guitar with Tom.
How can we prove it?
I'm not interested in seeing Tom.
Do you know who you are?
She sent him a postcard.
I'm not ashamed.
I was so hungry that I ate it.
Don't you want me to wait?
Tom seems to be fond of doing that.
They've fooled you.
I miss you.
Do you have a television?
Who broke the mug?
Tom doesn't want to talk to me.
Tom isn't in high school yet.
I've been trying to figure out how Tom did what he did.
Did the police arrest Tom?
I have sunglasses.
Tom realized the problem.
That helped you a lot.
Tom made a good impression.
Did you, or did you not, tip Tom off?
Don't eat my french fries.
They went to the United States last month.
He said that I must go there.
I'll forgive you and Tom.
Did you find out where Tom goes to school?
Tom doesn't know how long he'll need to stay in Boston.
Tom is going to the concert.
I designed it myself.
What a great view!
I left my wallet in the car.
Tom chose to stay.
Tom said he felt repulsed.
What time do you think Tom will arrive?
The Mexicans surrendered.
Do you know of any good inexpensive hotels in Boston?
I want you to keep up with me.
Weren't you the ones who wrote this?
I would've sent Tom money.
Tom's parents are divorced.
What should I order?
Please show me how to use the washing machine.
Our cat is in the kitchen.
I like chess.
Tom moved in with his brother.
I should tell Tom what to buy.
He is fatter than when I last saw him.
We have three dogs.
We saw guards coming toward us, so we hid in the bushes.
I feel helpless.
That is your book.
Food is running out.
Let's schedule a meeting.
I think that I'd like that.
We're just lucky.
Do you want me to get a doctor?
How much money do you need?
Where are the files?
Even poisonous snakes will only attack if they feel threatened.
Tom is impartial.
That happens to me a lot.
Nobody knew that you were in Germany.
I'm coming to your party and bringing you an unusual present.
I need to get a job.
I can't believe that Tom is a grandfather.
It's strange that Tom isn't here yet.
We live near a river.
An innocent man was arrested by mistake.
I haven't been hearing good things about him.
Didn't anybody follow you?
I don't feel well today and prefer to stay at home.
I saw that movie a long time ago.
I dropped the vase.
I enrolled in an art school when I was eight.
I wonder what those guys want.
Close that drawer.
What's this doing here?
Tom told everyone that he was lonely.
She's looking but she doesn't see anything.
When do you play tennis?
They're enemies.
The French president is to visit Japan next month.
The boys talked about video games.
Tom didn't seem very surprised that Mary did that.
She wants to meet him again.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I already told Tom.
Can you repeat what you said?
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
I was being selfish.
What're you up to?
Can I go to bed now?
The cops threw tear-gas bombs into the building.
I have company.
Everyone started arguing.
I appreciate all you've done for me.
We've found Tom.
Tom and Mary are in the living room.
Their house is being remodeled.
She likes going to the library.
I just received a text message from Tom.
No one can help.
Can I ask a question?
You look older than I am.
I met him in January.
This is taking us too long.
I was having tea with Tom.
Where's the nearest shopping mall?
Would you wait here for a minute?
Nobody is too old to learn.
I think you're funny.
I'm not dead, am I?
What a big dog!
We both agreed.
I thought that I told you not to come here.
I'm athletic.
Are you tall?
No one has time for that sort of thing.
Tom hasn't read the letter yet.
I'm not playing with you.
We've nearly finished preparations. How about taking a nap?
That's why I never tell you anything.
I knew that we shouldn't do that.
You're going to be a father.
They don't seem to approve of the plan.
Are you feeling better?
I am eating fruit.
They always give their attention to environmental problems.
Tom said he isn't planning to stay very long.
So, what do you suggest?
There will be no exceptions.
Try and find out when the train leaves.
Tom didn't buy it.
Tom started vomiting.
This place is fabulous.
Some aardvarks can live up to ten years.
His name is known all over the country.
He has more books than he can read.
They're gone.
Tom was very annoyed.
How did you learn to do this?
Tom seems different today.
These dogs are big.
The room is full of people.
So what's on your mind?
A river separates the city into east and west.
We'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
I thought you were mad at me.
Wipe that smirk off your face.
I'm just curious.
This is a secret.
I know who did it.
In my opinion, Twitter is a waste of time.
You're annoying.
Tom does that all day long.
We'll find Tom.
I don't even want to be here.
That apple is big.
Your method is better.
What street do you live on?
Tom postponed his departure for three days.
Please tell me you're kidding.
Why is there no hot water?
Tom knows how to handle a rifle.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
I don't want to hide from you anymore.
It was a fine day, so we went swimming.
Watch Tom for a moment, will you?
Have you seen my report?
I remember her face, but I don't remember her name.
We hid.
I won't fall in love again.
I don't think so.
Tom used to be the fastest swimmer on our team.
Have you done all your homework?
The holidays came to an end at last.
That's what Tom likes to do.
Fruits have seeds in them.
Why did you choose me?
We're cold.
Did you do anything interesting last week?
Parents will be invited to the school celebration.
We need some new ideas.

Just one moment, please.
You can't take it with you.
Did you receive an invitation?
I hope Tom is having a good time.
I pretended that I was sleeping.
Are you mocking me?
What on earth does this have to do with me?
I don't cook.
You're not ready for this.
Open your eyes.
Seriously?
Who sent this letter?

I'm finished with you.
Tom filled his plate with food.
Hey, what's this?

This answer may not necessarily be wrong.
You should've seen it.
I will tell you about him.

That is the same umbrella that I found on the bus.

No two words are identical in meaning.

Tell Tom when you'll do that.
He's a very zealous worker.

He may be the very man that I need.
Do you want more than that?
This piano is really cheap.
I'll never lie to you.
Why isn't anybody visiting my website?
I tried to stop Tom.
Stop daydreaming.
How exactly did you do that?
I said I would help you.
You don't have any idea what to do, do you?
Why don't you want to learn French?
She lost her temper and shouted at me.
Do you have a French dictionary?
I'm going to be out of town until next Monday.
I'd like to see you this afternoon.
Out of my way, boy.
Tom denied he had stolen the money.
I often refer to the dictionary.
We're parents.
You're not listening!
I've had some success doing it that way.
I'm not rich enough.
That'll happen eventually.
He always insists on having everything his own way.
Tell Tom this is urgent.
Tom took half of the money.

I don't know how to speak to young children.
I want to know who that guy is.
I've loved you from the moment I saw you.
We'll work this out.
I don't think it's true.
I persuaded him to take part in it.
I've got a million things to do.
Write to me if you need help.
I've already asked Tom to do that.
You know that Tom likes Mary, don't you?

Tom says he changes his password at least once a month.
Whose clock is it?
What's the goal?
When I got home, I found your letter waiting for me.
As incredible as it seems, he is a really strong guy.
They're strong.
Good morning, people!
I don't like this jacket.
It's probably a good idea.
I thought Tom would ask Mary to go to Boston with him.
Tom was covered with mud.
The guide led us to the hotel.
I wish I could speak French.
This is risky and dangerous.
Put it on the table.
I don't love Tom as much as he loves me.

This is probably a real diamond.
When you feel lonely, remember the happy moments we spent together.

Anybody can try.
He's the type of guy who doesn't take women very seriously.
I'm still trying to convince Tom to help us.

I don't usually wear jewelry.
Tell me when to begin.
Would you like to go to the aquarium with me?
I'm not talking about you.

Come this way.

I guess I lost track of the time.
Did you vote in the last election?
We need guns and ammunition.
I'm leaving for Boston.
I know a man who can speak French well.
You can't imagine what Tom is going through.
Eating too much fat is supposed to cause heart disease.
You make the world a better place.
There's not much difference between the two.
Let's all go together.
A strong draft's blowing in through that window.
All of us like her.
I'm sorry, but I have to go to the gym.
I've already decided not to do that.
The place was empty inside.
What did Tom say?
You're the only person I can trust.
You have to do what you have to do.

What's Tom want?
Tom wasn't trapped.
He climbed over the fence.
I disagree with just about everything Tom just said.

Don't forget it.
I'm still having that same problem.
You're such an idiot.
You'll never defeat us.
I want to know your name.

I seldom go to the movies.
I forgot her completely.
Tom lives with his father.
I saw him cross the street.
Tom is trying to do that.
Have you told everyone where the meeting will be?
All of us were silent.
What do you like to do on Sundays?
The big ugly tree destroys the beauty of the house.
Listen! They're playing my favorite music.
I'm never going to wear these shoes again.
See you at the reunion.
I tried to smile.
Someone's eating.
To make things even worse, he got sick.
Tom loves his children.
The girl sat beside me.
Tom said that he didn't understand what Mary said in French.
She taught him the tricks of the trade.
Don't laugh at him.
Tom stayed strong.
May I suggest another strategy?
This restaurant only accepts cash.
There's always a first time for everything.
Tom said he had better things to do.
Tom had his wallet stolen on the train.
When I was your age, things were very different.
I wanted to talk to my kids.
I'm going to prove it to you.
Tom and Mary don't want us here.
Tom isn't dumb.
Tom asked Mary to stop smoking.
Tom crossed the bridge.
I didn't know you two knew each other.
Give me that bottle.
I ironed the handkerchief.
Why aren't you doing anything?
Tom lost his car key.
Sign this.
Discussion resumed after a short interruption.
Have you ever done that before?
We're updating the site.
I've changed my profile picture.
I could be wrong.
What shall I do?
I just got here yesterday.
You won't be alone.
Tom has already closed all the windows.
Tom is legendary.
I have a much fresher piece of bread than you.
Just out of curiosity, what would you do?
We did what you asked.
I don't want to be involved in this affair.
I love fresh bread.
Your future is full of possibilities.
Do you have it with you?
We want our money back.
Tom told me he knew where Mary lived.
I go to the beach almost every day.
How did you know Tom was doing that?
I hope that you enjoy spicy food.
Would you like to go to Boston with us?
I thought I'd forgotten to tell you what to do.
There are usually between two and five lunar eclipses each year.
He is still too young for the job.
I bet you're hungry.
Tom refused to answer my question.
The girl we saw waiting in front of Tom's house was Mary.
I know that that sounds naive.
This door is locked from inside.
How old is the captain?
Why didn't you stay in Australia longer?
Do you have bread for lunch?
Did you bring your lunch from home?
Tom read all the documents.
It looks like Tom is really enjoying himself.
Tom saw some dead fish floating on the lake.
In spite of the storm, he went out.
I wanted to sit next to Tom.
This box is very heavy, so I can't carry it.
I know God will forgive me.
Tom is the only boy Mary talks to.
Honey, will you go shopping for me?
Did you skip school yesterday?
My father won't allow it.
I guess I'm wrong.
What's that bird?
Tom wants to go to the movies.
Who taught you how to speak French?
I'll go and see what the children are doing.
Tom can't read yet.
Tom still loves Mary even though she doesn't love him anymore.
You're not God.
Tom doesn't want to do that without the proper tools.
Let me see the pictures you took in Paris.
You don't believe me, do you?
Tom said he didn't know if he had enough time to do that.
We're winning.
I like to sleep on a soft bed.
I hear he is looking for work.
I often see him.
You've already done that.
Have you ever been to Europe?
I don't know which is which.
We've already taken your name off the list.
I know Tom isn't a brave person.
I saw Tom hit Mary.
She got very angry with her children.
I held him by the collar.
Better him than me.
He bought a plane ticket.
I know that you're just being sarcastic.
Tom is taller than me.
With the abolition of African slavery in 1863, workers were brought in from India and Java.
I think watching TV is a waste of time.
Which subway goes downtown?
He started to speak English.
Let's get back to work.
I know you were expecting Tom to be here.
I had to give Tom time to think about it.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I saw that.
For a moment, Tom was too surprised to speak.
Could you ask Tom to stop by after work?
Do you like haggling?
We were surprised to hear the news.
Tom seems to be busy.
The teacher said that he wouldn't give us an exam this week.
I didn't know that we were supposed to help you do that.
I need that tape.
I wouldn't visit Boston if I were you.
I really think you shouldn't do that.
Why did they try to do that?
I stopped drinking coffee.
I can read English.
What do you want to do tomorrow?
There's a dog sleeping on the porch.
Don’t get the phone wet.
Do you want me to come in with you?
Have you ever walked through a graveyard at midnight?
I'm disappointed.
Tom probably doesn't want to do that.
Fill this out.
I don't want to discuss Tom's problems.
I have an appointment I don't want to be late for.
Keep it.
I get phone calls every day from Tom.
The lights are all off.
You need to practice more.
Tom said Mary was afraid.
What color is your hair?
They were ready.
Some words have double meanings.
Tom dozed off in French class.
You aren't permitted to bring dogs into this building.
Let's not fool ourselves about that project.
Nice to meet you.
How do you operate this machine?
I wonder whether I'll be able to do that.
Do you know how to ski?
I plan to stay as long as you stay.
My sister is three years older than I am.
Unfortunately, many people don't trust us anymore.
Mary is a widow.
I didn't eat lunch yesterday.
Double-click on the icon.
Is it a cat or a dog?
Mary is wearing a lot of makeup.
We're running out of time.
It's hard, you know.
I am convinced that things will change for the better.
I don't know for certain.
Tom works at a store that's not too far from where he lives.
Tom asked Mary to text him.
I'm not good at it.
Run faster.
Do you have it?
I'd like to do an autopsy on this body.
Don't say a word to anyone.
He took pictures of me with his camera.
Tom is a Native American.
I think he likes me.
Beware of the dog!
I'm not eating this potato salad.
She plays tennis in the morning.
I can't stop laughing at this video.
This might take a little work.
I'll be at tomorrow afternoon's meeting.
That's confusing.
Can I get Tom to do it?
Tom is a bureaucrat.
The party was fun. You should have come, too.
Will he eat the whole cake?
Stay in your room.
He was called back from his trip.
Why do you like Boston so much?
We learned French.
I like elephants.
Tom put on his sweater inside out.
Don't forget to pay the rent.
Tom's mother was a nurse.
He's coming.
No one is there.

You can't keep doing this to Tom.
Have you ever done anything right?
Where are our friends?
How did you come to that conclusion?
Nobody had ever asked Tom that question before.
I was born and raised in Tokyo.
The fact remains that he is guilty.
He deserves the prize.
This is a fascinating book.
You're cute.
Tom had to go to the hospital.
Everyone has been there.
How about tonight?
I am the fastest runner.
I know the system.

My father neither smokes nor drinks.
Do you want me to walk you home?
I hope that is not the case.

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the seven days of the week.
Can we meet tomorrow?
It gave me a headache.
I can't see.
How much money did you give Tom?
Tom seems shocked.
I think I've never seen you so drunk before.
Everything is back to normal.
What's it all for?
Tom went to Mary's house to help her.
What if something gets broken?
I feel a lot better now.
I want to try something else.
Everyone began to laugh.
I'll make sure.
Tom can be trusted.
Seeing me, they suddenly stopped talking.
I still don't know who I'm supposed to talk to.
Where do you think Tom wants to do that?
I doubt that Tom is still mad.
She wrote him a long letter, but she didn't mail it.
Those roses are very beautiful.
I've never had the opportunity.
Tom is going to be OK, isn't he?
I love cheese.
I want you to help me.
I don't like doing this.
You might be arrested at any time.
Tom was afraid people would laugh at him.
I insist that we leave immediately.
It's interesting, isn't it?
Tom quit studying French.
I thought I could do that by myself.
Tom is also from Boston, isn't he?
The line is busy now.
You didn't go by yourself, did you?
I always walk to school.
That's what interests me.
I've always thought you were a Canadian.
The only one here who can probably go with us is Tom.
I know we've got to keep working.
The fuse blew.
Tom hasn't done that yet this year.
I'm not certain Tom is the one I need to worry about.
Think carefully before answering.
How long will I have to wait?
The dress suits you very well.
Tom doesn't want to take any chances.

I take full responsibility.
I thought you needed money.
Continue working.
If only I knew!
I'll give you a call when I've decided what to do.
I love the sound of rain on the roof.
I've got to do what I believe is right.
I know him by name.
We're conducting a survey.
The event is on Monday.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
Bananas are yellow.
I fail to see the reason.
Tom is unemployed.
Would you like some help?
Nobody has the right to do that.
I borrowed Tom's car.
I'll be back when I'm ready.
I'm going to miss Tom's smile.
The moment they find it, they will be surprised.
Get in. I'll give you a ride.
Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.
You'll get better at it the more you do it.
My watch is ten minutes slow.
We worked on a farm last summer.
What vegetables do you have in your garden?
Tom reads slowly.
Which book did you buy?
Tom didn't want to do that, but he had to.
Can Tom really do the job?
I want to watch this movie.
Men believe what they want to.
You're quite forgetful, aren't you?
I'm just surprised to see you.
Tom went to the city by bus.
They're having a really good time.

He says that he has to go to Vienna the day after tomorrow.
Do you plan to attend today's meeting?
I have to find it.
It seems strange.
Tom wants to party all the time.
I don't know what I know.
Ignorance is bliss.
Tom plays the piano quite well.
How many pens do you have?
I didn't read it all.
Can I have the menu again, please?
Keep an eye on the baby while I'm away.
Why did you do that?
You do have a choice.
I don't think that Tom would let you win.
Mary is brushing her hair.
Tom isn't going to let you win.
I have allergies.
How long does it usually take you to walk home?
Why is that baby crying?
They were playing tennis.
I think he likes you.
Shut your mouth.
Didn't you know that?
I'm pleased with the result.
Thanks for your support.
Don't confuse astrology with astronomy.
It's too late for you.
I'd like to call Tom and see if he can come visit me tomorrow.

Go ahead, shoot me.
You're embarrassing Tom.
I drove across the bridge.
He comes from Wales.
This book is also available in French.

I need a bigger box.
I've almost finished doing what needs to be done.
How long have you been busy?
Did you know that Tom has never learned to drive?
I don't think Tom will be hungry.
The children are hungry.
I decided to wait.
There are about 6 billion people in the world.
I must concentrate.

I'll take charge of the work.
I went to the nearby library to find some books on the subject.
Put the knife on the table.

Tom caught me.
Tom has chickens.
This shower is broken.
I'm sure that Tom is right.
Are you going to help me find it?
You should've listened to Tom.
Take Tom.
I want to know how much it's going to cost me to go to Australia with you.
You must not go out today.
You're asking the wrong person.
Why did Tom ask Mary to do that?
Why didn't you warn us?
Boston is a beautiful city.
Tom is signing documents.
Everyone was wearing gloves.
How can life get any better?
Where ever did you buy it?
I need more supplies.
I have some more bad news.
Why did you stay home yesterday?
The homework is due next Monday.
It's your decision, Tom.
Thanks for the recommendation.
Nobody does that.
Tom needs your attention.
I wonder if Tom is still selfish.
I'm able to read French.
How many hours is the flight?
Where will you eat this evening?
It's a good restaurant, but it's quite expensive.
Tom and his brother play on the same team.
Have a nice flight.
Is this a good time to talk?
We all speak French.
Guess who I am.
I plan to spend all day with Tom.
I don't think so.
He speaks French.
Tom was yelling at Mary.
Tom and Mary usually speak French to each other.
You don't look anything like Tom.
Tom hid the knife under his bed.
I want to go shopping.
He was right after all.
He died of cancer last year.
He avoids me.
It's the ideal moment to buy.
Frankly speaking, he's wrong.
I've never voted.
Tom is never coming home again, is he?
What're you doing with this?
I'm getting married to her in June.
The book is on the table and the pen is on the windowsill.
Please let me carry your bag.
Go there with me.
What'll we do if Tom is late?
When you say this, you sound just like father.
Tell me what I should do first.
The thing I'm planning to do is study French.
Take off your jacket and empty your pockets.
Tom thought Mary was dead.
I've got to do my job.
I know Tom is a good boss.
How long have you been engaged?
I like jazz music.

She was asked to the party.
I've had enough.
Everything that could go wrong went wrong.
Tom said that he needed to get some sleep.
I had to stop.
Why are you upset?
You sing like an angel.
Tom wouldn't do that if he didn't want to.
Don't talk to the bus driver while he's driving.
I'll send you the link.

Tom was wearing sandals.
What subjects do you like best?
Tom went to see Mary three days after that.

What's going to happen to us?
It looks as if autumn is really here.

You must study more.
No, no! That's not right.

For once in my life, I'd like to do something right.
I always eat breakfast.
I'm thinking of you.
Tom will go to Boston.
This circle was drawn by a compass.

What caused the fire?
You're rich.
Tom is a prisoner.
Wait inside the car.
They gave me no choice.
I still don't know the rules.
Tom told me that he'd like to become a doctor.
Tom, it's not your fault.
I am from the Netherlands.
I just hope it's not too late.
Please get off the couch.
Tom gives us what we want.
Mary believes in the power of love.
I know his address.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.

Where were you and Tom?
You shouldn't leave the house.

Do you cry often?
The men are eating lunch.
In the United States, cars drive on the right side of the road.
You have been busy.
She was happy that she passed the exam.
We'll have breakfast at eight o'clock.
I'm going to do that some other time.

This is my apartment.
Tom delivered newspapers when he was a teenager.
The police arrested the man who had murdered the girl.

I don't trust anybody.
My heart was filled with happiness.
Call me at the office.
Tom said he thought Mary could win.
I don't like this song.
I knew we'd regret giving Tom a knife.
We sat together in silence for some time.
I'll talk to you later.
He accepted her gift.
I'm doing my duty.
Great work, people!
Tom stayed.
He read the letter over and over.
Tom is three years older than me.
Who is playing the piano?
I read a lot.
Are you two talking about me?
Where were they?
Tom said he was very tired.
Close your book.
Wait.
Tom bought a used car.
I won't eat here again.
You did good work.

Are you quite sure about that?
Expect more of the same.
I think that that's the case here.
Tom asked Mary a question in French.
I'm still confused.
Do you want to go on a trip with me?
The prominent psychologist resembles my uncle in appearance.
Listen to this.
Don't drop that glass.
We didn't have a fight.
Why is that so important?
Who wants cookies?
Is your watch correct?
Let's go back.
I hope you're having fun.
Did you start to learn the piano when you were three, like Mozart?
You did that the wrong way.
Tom wishes he could speak French as well as Mary does.
I'm not going to do it again.
He's coming closer.
Would you pass me the salt?
I got my leg hurt in the accident.
Tom and Mary played hide-and-go-seek.
You won't be able to bribe Tom.
I've already told you more than I should've.
Shut the door tight.
Tom behaved strangely.
Stuff happens.
I love both cats and dogs.
Tom likes the ocean.
Tom likes you more than he likes anyone else.
Are you in favor of the workers getting more money?
I wouldn't tell Tom anything if I were you.
You are a troublemaker.
We have no way to verify this.
Tom said that Mary likes doing that.
How far are you from here?
He practices playing the guitar until late at night.
You ought to just tell the truth.
You know me well.
I hope you're well.
Tom needs to be more careful.
Tomorrow is her birthday.
Do you like frozen yogurt?
There's not much difference between the two.
I won't sleep tonight.
They rented a house.
He's doing something there.
Tom knew Mary had to help John.
I like studying languages.
He's a year and five months old, but he can't walk yet.

The weather couldn't have been better.
Anything can happen.
How's your wife doing?
Have you finished packing?
They seem worried.
You're free to use this room.
Tom noticed that Mary wasn't wearing the ring he'd given her.
I left at midnight.
My car is parked in the alley.
Everyone went to sleep.
It's a promise.
Everyone believed you.

Don't you ever laugh?
I've heard French is a tricky language.
Don't forget to turn off the light.
She's accustomed to getting up early.
I think that I have a gum infection.

By the way, did you find the umbrella you said you'd lost the other day?
He is in charge of the class.
Tom spent a lot of time writing this report.
Let's wait.
By the time I arrived, Tom had already left.
I call her up every day.

Did anybody eat with you?
What's your favorite open source game?
That isn't the way that my grandmother made stuffing.
Could you please repeat it once again?
We'll be late.
I'd rather go by subway than by train.
I'm trying to think of something to do.
Her hobby was collecting old coins.
That's worth three hundred dollars.
He sacrificed his own life to save them.
Tom looked like he was done.
I'm as tall as you.
I've had to do everything by myself.
He doesn't study as hard as he used to.
They must not have heard me.
I got homesick.
I taught Tom how to drive.
You have to go to the party.
We don't have any other choice.
I can't believe that you love me.
You can invite other people.
Don't let go.
I don't want to be late for work.
There are no strings attached.
I bought a red sports car.
Tom is doing pushups.
There are lots of advantages.
How did you like the film?
Tom was sitting very close to Mary.
Both Tom and Mary were angry.
Form two lines.
Where are we going to go?
She decorated the wall with pictures.
Tom almost never helps us.
Daddy, I can't walk any more. Carry me.
I've never had a traffic accident.
They did it anyway.
Do you know why?
I already have one.
You should work hard.
English is a language spoken throughout the world.
I don't know if you remember me.
I'll never understand why Tom did that.
Tom is driving me crazy.
I think that Mary is more beautiful than Alice is.
It's only another false alarm.
Why are you so quiet?
A day has twenty-four hours.
Would you like a piece of cake?
I think it's time for me to ask for directions.
Don't lie to yourselves.
Tom taught me how to drive.
Do you want it?
Each student has a locker.
Those are Tom's.
She talked to the chairman.
Tom hasn't painted the fence yet.
She asked me if I knew Tom's address.
You owe me three dollars.
I hope your car doesn't get stolen.
Tom allowed Mary to come in.
I had another beer.
How did you get Tom to say yes?
I think that Tom already knows why Mary did that.
What brings you here?
People who talk about themselves all the time bore me.
How much is this going to cost me?
Furthermore, I still don't think this a huge cultural difference.
He probably won't approve your proposal.
There were bullet holes in the windshield.
There are still a lot of things that have to be done.
Tell Tom I'm on my way.
Don't be such a baby.
Wash your face.
They did all they could.
I just want to humiliate Tom.
You're going to pay me, aren't you?
He thinks I'm in love with her.
I was about to go out when he came to see me.
Do you expect me to pay?
I opened the trunk.
Tom is fluent in French and English.
We should leave.
Tom doesn't seem to be as motivated as Mary.
Everyone is welcome.
We won't ask anymore.
Fill out this form, please.
I hope you don't die.
I'm not suggesting that.
What you said was very funny.
We need to hurry if we want to get there in time.
He knows New York inside out.
Tom gave Mary a book about Australia.
There's no one home.
Tom bought a thirty dollar bottle of wine.
I love the way you sing.
I don't want you to make the same mistake I did.
Tom seems biased.
Tom was promoted to first lieutenant on October 20, 2013.
I want to see Boston.
Tell Mary I love her.
Give me that knife.
How did you know I was lying?
I forgot that the daylight saving time ended last week.
We have to find rules that work.
Have you found your ticket yet?
I play the guitar before dinner.
Tom seems to be in a good mood today.

I have several statues in my garden.
I apologize for showing up unannounced.
Birds sing early in the morning.
I heard that Tom wants to swim this afternoon.
Tom is listening to his iPod.
Tom called the neighbors.
Things have calmed down.
They should apologize.
Tom knows where you are.
I don't want to risk my life.
Are you talking to me?
My brother wants to go to the moon some day.
He felt uneasy in his father's presence.
I'm sure he's alive.
I had already eaten before I arrived at the party.
Tom does that, but Mary doesn't.
Does Tom want to rest?
Tom is a hunk.
I feel like having a pizza.
Are you having trouble sleeping?
Are they the people you told me about?
What else did Tom eat?
There were children everywhere.
One boy is taller than the other.
Aren't you going to sit with us?
The picnic was put off on account of rain.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
This was a long letter.
How would that help?
Don't skip classes, OK?
Tom shouldn't have kept Mary waiting so long.
I wanted some more time.
That's very easy to do.
Who was Mona Lisa?
It's nearly six o'clock.
It was a new experience for me.
How much does that cost?
How many flowers are in the vase?
Where were you when that happened?
This isn't real.
I want to see you in my office.
That shouldn't happen at all.
How much does a three-year old weigh?
I can't decode the message.
Go wake Tom up.
I'm glad we were there.
Tom has no idea when Mary will arrive.
Do you think I don't know what's going on?
I'm sure something will work out for you.
How much do we owe Tom?
Don't get your new pants dirty.
I don't believe he's a lawyer.
What's the scariest thing that has ever happened to you?
Tom has just now finished doing that.
I didn't click the link.
I've already done that a lot of times.
I know that you don't want to talk to me.
Tom takes a bath every evening after dinner.
Stop moving.
I can't do that to you.
I hope it works.
Their food was great last time.
Get everyone out of here.
That's a secret I can't tell you.
I stopped smoking once and for all.
Tom got really mad.
My camera is much better than yours.
Can you drive?
I'm going to be in Boston all week.
Romania's capital is Bucharest.
Those are yours, aren't they?
I remember something.
Tom is as tall as you.
This key doesn't fit in the lock.
I used to be a vegetarian.
The trunk is already open.
I know Tom is a showoff.
The exception proves the rule.
I'm a little bit busy.
Close all the windows.
I usually get up at six.
You made the same mistake again.
She was fond of poetry and music.
Tom isn't being very friendly, is he?
Tom is stubborn, isn't he?
I didn't have time to proofread my report.
I didn't have to say or do anything.
How cute!
How naive do you think I am?
You should tell Tom you can't do that.
She was a bundle of nerves last night.
January is the first month of the calendar.
You can talk to me, you know?
Many flights were canceled because of the storm.
We were expecting it.
Who did you write a letter to?
I am full of doubt.
I'm with a client.
They danced.
Do you think you can do that without any help?
Tom knew I was awake.
I feel like walking.
Tom's French is really good.
You look sad today.
How much do the carrots cost?
I sell flowers.
People always complain about the weather.
Is that all you have to do?
I'll ignore that.
I used to love Boston.
Have pity on us.
We're not old.
She ignores him completely.
I wasn't able to stay in Boston as long as I wanted to.
We must do all we can to make Tom happy.
If all goes according to plan, it just might work.
I think so.
He didn't speak to me at all.
I want to know what's going on out here.
I don't want to visit Australia.
I already told you not to smoke in your room.
We often go skiing in the winter.
Tom looks more like his grandfather than his father.
Soccer is my favorite sport.
We don't live in Boston.
I don't know Tom well, but I know his wife.
It was worse.
No one in their right mind would do that.
We need to look into the matter.
She has a cat. The cat is white.
Tom needs furniture.
My appointment is at 2:30.
Aren't you worried?
Tom is often too direct.
I'm telling you this confidentially.
Have you already chosen the songs you're going to play tonight?
Tom is OK now.
Tom can't whistle.
I'm not in love with him. We're just good friends.
I want to talk with my lawyer.
I've no idea.
I think that Tom didn't really enjoy doing that.
I'm sure I'll beat Tom next time.
I bumped into him at the station.
I'll be there Monday.
The man was charged with theft.
It took me several hours to repair it.
Stop apologizing.
He broke his left arm.
That small star is brightest.
Tom deciphered the code.
Bring that correspondence up to date.
The sidewalk is still a bit slippery.
I'm trying to improve.
We have to analyze that.
I want to be a bodyguard.
I'm early.
I have a lot of responsibilities.
It doesn't seem real.
I've just been shot.
It'll take about thirty minutes to get to the station by taxi.
Tom speaks French a little better than I do.
I need a lawyer who can speak French.
What kind of songs does Tom sing?
It's all you can really do.
Tom was the one that was driving.

I need to buy more pens.
I know this isn't easy.
Tom doesn't have to change his plans.
I don't know what to do with it.
That didn't occur to me.
The birth rate and death rate were nearly equal.
Let's order two bottles.
You'll have to do that as well.
It is their only choice.
I haven't seen a single cat this whole trip.
I'll pay you well.
I think that you're a good leader.
I appreciate your family.
What time can you come?

I cut myself shaving.
You're better at remembering things than I am.
I've already forgotten why you said we were supposed to do this.
Do whatever you want.
Tom said he wasn't offended.
Tom can speak a little French.
I have an apple.
I'm quite hungry.
Are you still married?
Are you really planning to do that?
They say that Tom didn't do that.
You look like Harry Potter.
I haven't seen you in ages.
I don't know who won.
This is the key to the whole mystery.
Do you want to help me?
I'm responsible for what my son has done.
I know Tom is creative.
Tom knows I'm homesick.
I was distracted.
It was one of the best movies Tom had ever seen.
I'm nervous.
Tom was one of the last people to arrive.
My friends are very loyal.
Give me five more minutes.
Tom pretended not to know the answer.
You are really talented.
Do you have any cheaper rooms?
Keep the meter running.
When do you need it by?
I'd like to hear what you have to say on this.
We're not poor.
I ran away from home.
Is this what you really want?
Now I'm done.
That's why I came late.
As far as I know, he won't come.
I'll try to keep you informed.
I'm sure that wasn't intentional.
Tom knew I was sleepy.
Everyone deserves a chance.
My fingers are numb.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Words can't describe it.
Few people speak my language.
That building is beautiful.
Can Tom come with us?
It is worth visiting that museum.
Would you look after my children while I am away on vacation?
Go away.
I'll answer all of your questions.
He bought it for five dollars.
It all ended as suddenly as it started.
What do you have in your pocket?
What are you guys going to do today?
He is in need of money.
We haven't been invited yet.
He kept me waiting for a long time.
Tom smoothed his hair.
I'm at the bank.
You have to be very strong.
I insist we do this now.
I want your opinion.
I saw an opportunity and I took it.
Don't waste your time.
I'll tell you a secret.
Tom isn't the only one Mary talked to.
I don't want to hurt her.
I didn't think that you'd buy that.
We must register for the courses that we're going to take by tomorrow.
I'd like to meet Tom's sister.
I wonder whether Tom has a girlfriend.
I will sell it as soon as I find a buyer.
I think that I'm a likable guy.
I'll leave a key for you on the table.
Does she speak English?
I always knew Tom would come back.
You'd better sit here.
It might happen to you.
I don't think I'm the only one here who speaks French.
I've never met a Canadian I didn't like.
Tom isn't back from Australia yet.
Did anyone get hurt?
Go tell that to Tom.
Let's go to the circus.
Tom gets offended easily.
I don't like that sentence.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I finished my math assignment.
Why won't you give me a chance?
Can I ask one more question?
I don't think that it's dangerous.
Tom is in his office working late.
I appreciate your prudence.
You almost hit me.
The events unfolded just as she predicted.
Tom seemed fine.
What do you think Tom did with the money he stole?
Tom was dreaming.
This is the best investment I've ever made.
I know that you have a boyfriend.
I'll wait for you here.
I like cats.
Do you have a Yahoo ID?
He took charge of the firm after his father's death.
Tom doesn't understand why we did that.
A decision has been made.
Tom didn't even look at me.
It's always worth a try.
Why are you so upset now?
Let's not talk about money now.
They are chiseling a statue out of marble.
My name's Tom. What's yours?
It's definitely a nuisance.
Tom knew Mary had a lot of money.
That was unfair.
Tom is still very upset.
You can come if you want.
Tom didn't leave Mary.
A true friend would not say such a thing.
What's your favorite summer sport?
That's the biggest alligator I've ever seen.
I won't be home until Monday.
Attention please!
We got the results that we'd hoped for.
They come from the same country.
I'm drinking milk.
What does this mean?
I'll need some help with this.
I had a chance to do that yesterday, but I decided not to.
Tom could be in Boston.
Did you enjoy yourselves yesterday?
I know Tom.
This car doesn't belong to me.
I won't be able to sleep tonight.
Can you tell Tom I called?
I don't think that it's such a bad idea.
I'm going to take a look.
He lost all his belongings.
Tom is my type.
You must keep your room clean.
Why did it have to be me?
Have you ever thought about doing that?
He has the habit of making others jealous.
I didn't know you could cook so well.
It's the only thing I can think of.
Tom probably could help you on Monday.
I don't want to hurt you, Tom.
How much does a kilo of chestnuts cost?
I need to take a vacation.
You have to do something about it.
We all did that again.
Keep the door open.
Tom is the newest member of our team.
Southerners didn't like people from the North.
Tom bought some rice.
I took off my clothes.
What a bunch of idiots!
I'm not shy.
Stop Tom.
It's dangerous.
Tom never understood that.
Tom remains under house arrest.
Please don't follow this advice.
Did you go to school yesterday?
Tom is running out of food.
I'm not younger than Tom.
I love you more than I love any other person.
Don't listen to him.
I'm going to the bank.
I need volunteers.
Everything in the world is connected to everything else.
That's Tom's step-sister.
My father takes a bath before supper.
I think that helped me.
Why are you taking pictures?
Just looking at her, you can tell that she likes you.
I didn't think I was going to get caught.
What color is your dog?
I'm the only one who's done that.
I'm pretty sure that Tom won't agree to do that.
Everyone knew Tom was lying.
Are you in love?
I don't want to go anywhere tonight.
I signed the form.

Will you help me with my homework?
Don't let her go out after dark.
I honestly don't care.
Is it too complicated?
I want to spend some time with Tom in Boston.
I really like your sweater.
Tom wants to learn some French songs.
Do you think I'm cynical?
I won't give up.
Don't be disappointed.
Tom shouldn't have thrown rocks at those cats.
I don't think it means anything.
Tom has a goatee.
I've read every page except the last one.
Since I was sick, I didn't go to school.
Don't you hate it when that happens?
I'd rather have a piece of cake.
Calm down and tell me what happened.
I didn't ask even one question.
It wasn't me who translated this.
My dad was an actor.
May I see my daughter?
I've come to see Tom.
I've got so much left to do.
I don't doubt your intentions.
I made some stew. Do you want some?
What kind of woman could love a guy like Tom?
Everything was good.
It's hard to talk about things like this.
I didn't see Tom coming.
Tom was screaming.
If you're cold, maybe you should put more clothes on.
I have to make a phone call.
It is he who is to blame.
I waited for hours, but she didn't show up.
We're solving our problems.
Is he tall?
You can listen to anything you want.
Stand at ease!
Tom doesn't want to let Mary go.
When was the last time you played chess?
We're quitting.
Tom peeled the apple before he ate it.
I will never throw away my Playstation.
Even though he lives in the United States, Tom can't speak English.
I already have plans for this weekend.
Do they both understand French?
I'm going to tear down this wall.
I think that Tom is about thirty years old.
I managed to catch the 8 o'clock train by running all the way to the station.
Tom should've invited Mary.
How barbaric!
Well, I can't wait to get back to work.
Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
I don't know the woman who's talking to our teacher.
May we speak in private?
The police can't arrest Tom.
I don't think I have what it takes to be a teacher.
She's happy.
We got separated.
Tom told me he'd cried.
Who are these presents for?
Don't you agree, Tom?
Tom ordered pizza.
She has about 2,000 books.
I wish I were thinner.
If I were rich, I'd buy it.
I noticed that I was being observed.
I was told to go home.
It disgusts me.
I'll let you know if it happens.
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
She types well.
Don't tell Tom what we did.
This is very strange.
May I put it here?
I still want to speak French.
Tom is anxious to know the result.
That's how you do it.
Aren't you coming in?
She has been blind from birth.
Dates will be announced.
What time do you go to the market?
Tom bought a book.
I know that Tom knows that I hardly ever do that.
Will you be home tonight?
Do your best.

He took a deep breath.
Please add my name to the list.
Tom was wearing a blue sweater.
As soon as he returns, I will tell you.
I haven't spoken to you before, have I?
What were you doing in my house?
My wife gave birth prematurely to a 1,500-gram baby girl.
Come tomorrow.
I've never seen Tom cry.
The train is ten minutes late today.

I don't want you to drive my car.
You did that already.
Who'll cook?
Tom knows where you are.
Could you elaborate on your new theory?
I sat up all last night reading a novel.
There's no logical explanation for this.

There are only two possibilities.
Tom is sitting at the table.
I'll try to do that.
I've given you too many chances.
I don't have any books in my room.
Tom is arrogant.

I just want this headache to go away.
There is a man at the door.
I'm creative.
I'm going to level with you.
Are you doing OK?
I enjoyed playing tennis over the weekend.
I've got a better idea.
She stole a lot of money from him.
Tom is disgusting.
You're worried.
Will it clear up this afternoon?
I wish you all the best.
I haven't met Tom's family yet.
I'm not satisfied with your explanation.
Aha! So that's what's going on!
The soldiers were tried in court for murder.
She was dressed in red.
Does it hurt when you chew?
Today I have a lot of things to do.
Why are you studying French?
It seems that no one knew the truth.
Have you ever played Truth or Dare before?
Do you understand her?
Tom is never here in the morning.
It's bizarre.
Some of the bluest water in the world is found in Crater Lake.
Tom thinks that it was a prank.
Do you live near here?
I don't want to let Tom go.
Tell Tom that I want to go, too.
I eat three times a day.
I'm afraid of wild animals.
Tom didn't seem to have a cold.
Should I have my tooth extracted?
Tom is still uncertain about whether to go to college or not.
I need to talk to you immediately.
You should do it.
The dog frightened the children away.
Tom got on the wrong bus.
In case of emergency, call the police.
I was just as surprised as Tom.
I've canceled my trip to Boston.
Tom is a very lucky boy.
Did you lose weight?
Tom isn't in the office.
I didn't expect you to come today.
He was sound asleep.
She was hurt in the accident.
I don't have time to help you with your homework.
Is Tom with you?
Everyone should learn at least two foreign languages.
Is the road open?
I'm a hero.
Tom can speak French very well.
It'll be sunny tomorrow afternoon.
I need envelopes.
The point is that they are hungry.
The children are asleep upstairs.
Tom didn't have any reason not to trust Mary.
Our price is considerably higher than the current market price.
Who drank all the wine?
Tom gets lost easily.
I have a lot of things to do.
There must be a logical explanation.
I think it's the best way.
That's the reason he became angry.
You're only three years older than me.
He needed more time to complete the task.
He loves ceremonies.
I'm dehydrated.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
They'll do it.
Tom's house is haunted.
Have you ever been in love?
He makes life miserable for everyone around him.
Read this page.
That isn't relevant.
The birds are singing.
Mary isn't Tom's biological daughter.
Tom had other things on his mind.
I'm lost. Could you please help me?
Tom is very lucky.
Are you speaking from personal experience?
Tom is allergic to dust.
I can't picture Tom and Mary together.
Where did Tom learn all this?
Tom and Mary bought a home with a pool.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom was mad at us.
He has atrocious table manners.
I came here to see you.
I'd like to be a teacher.
Tom told Mary to stop doing that.
I work at the consulate.
Thank you for being such a good friend.
You're a bookworm.
Goodbye!
How many books do you think you've read so far?
Be serious.
Tom agreed to think about it.
Are you sure you don't remember?
I finally finished the test.
Did everyone agree with it?
What happened? There's water all over the apartment.
Tom said he wouldn't go with Mary.
I hope that you enjoy this holiday season.
I'll have to think about that.
Tom is reading the novel Mary gave him.
Tom took pictures of the squirrels.
Don't eat so much. You'll get fat.
I'm the only one who knows how to do this.
We had to wait.
I borrowed the screwdriver from a friend of mine.
I like this dog.
Let's get some sleep.
The man robbed him of all his money.
I've become very interested in ancient art.
Tom's French is perfect.
This one's a little harder.
Where did it happen?
I can play soccer.
You need to take off your shoes before entering.
It's a good plan.
He shrugged his shoulders.
Have they gone?
What's Tom eating?
She's been in the hospital for a month.
I know it's not impossible.
We estimated the damage at one thousand dollars.
I'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl.
I'm talking to myself.
I'll give you a call later.
She can speak three foreign languages.
Tom said no one was awake.
I paid three dollars for that book.
One of the kids didn't get off the bus.
My tie is orange.
I was surprised by it.
My car was stolen.
They couldn't help us.
Tom has finished.
Stay healthy.
Has Tom ever hit you?
Tom used Mary's credit card.
He is not kind to her.
Don't play baseball here.
I want to go and live in Boston.
Do Tom and Mary know each other?
Please write to me as soon as possible.
My mother has cooked ten eggs.
I don't have any interest in art whatsoever.
Hi. How are you doing?
Let's not let this chance slip away.
Tom is willing to help.
It's mandatory.
I think that that's where we're at.
I want to learn some French songs.
Cut them with a knife.
What do you want to know about us?
His crime deserved the death penalty.
My friend is beside me.
Tom is a little shy.
The police arrested the thief.
I feel like things are getting better.
Are you studying?
Tom took a picture of the kitten.
Tom needs to find some way to do that.
Who sings this song?
Memorize this.
What are you thinking?
Have you called the boss already?
Does Tom work in Boston?
Tom is now the manager, isn't he?
What a cute dog!
You've got cancer.
You are too sensitive to criticism.
I don't have anything to eat.
You may come with us if you want to.
What do you think you're going to do?
Newly printed books smell good.
How long will it take to fix this?
I think you should read it yourself.
Tom's business is doing quite well.
I tried to save you.
I decided to wait.
She's taller than him.
I dislocated my shoulder.
You need to eat vegetables every day.
What happened to your hair?
He began to cry loudly.
I don't know who my mother is.
We're working.
Tom's dog is much bigger than Mary's dog.
Tom is still young enough to do that.
I was just doing my duty.
How close were you?
Did you really think I was the one who painted this picture?
You said I could talk to Tom.
You already know what to do.
I was so unhappy.
I sold my house in 2013.
Tom didn't allow his daughter Mary to go to the party.
The test came back negative.
Tell me what you think about my car.
I no longer work here.
He cut the meat with a knife.
I'm afraid you've misunderstood me.
Tom will be back in about three hours.
Tom will try to persuade Mary not to do that.
Tom's mother is a housewife.
Did you vote yet?
I didn't know that Tom was Canadian.
Tom won't want to be disturbed.
Have you ever seen such a beautiful sunset?
I want to take Mary somewhere romantic tonight.
Are you going to kiss me?
Literature teaches us about humanity.
I'd like to help you.
Tom complained about the test.
Are you acquainted with that man?
I wish I had your problems.
If I had time, I could help you.
We'd better get started.
You must never forget that.
I think I'm in love with you.
I don't want any of the stuff Tom gave me.
Stop making fun of me.
He got very drunk.
The city is two miles away.
You should come to Boston with me.
Where did you get this key?
Say it isn't true.
There's a very good chance that Tom will get that job.
I've started eating meat again.
All of a sudden, Tom and I were alone.
Is there anything else that I can do for you?
The box has holes in it.
Tom asked for my help.
If you're not busy, could you please help me?
I'm sorry I called you a liar.
The train was going 500 miles per hour.
The gas tank is almost empty.
He has a brother in Tokyo.
Is this enough?
He is lacking in common sense.
There are six apples in the box.
Did you really think I was the one who painted this picture?
How was your honeymoon?
I have so many things to do.
I think you've got me confused with someone else.
Tom and I'll miss Mary.
Tom is young.
Tom winked.
You're living in the past.
Tom didn't want the police to enter his house.
Tom wasn't the first boy Mary kissed.
Tom says he doesn't know much about Boston.
I drove Tom to school.
It's very upsetting.
I think that Tom moved to Boston.
It was so dark that they could hardly see.
Are you people stupid?
I don't need him anymore.
What else can I do for you?
We should be careful.
Tom kindly answered questions.
No one has ever been able to enter the room.
I'd be happy here, I think.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
Tom is washing his hands in the sink.
I know you don't like chocolate.
Tom can explain the situation.
Tom is unhurt.
How old is your dog?
All the other boys laughed at him.
Are you feeling better?
Tom said Mary is busy.
I'll return at 6:30.
I sold it for three hundred dollars.
He hasn't had much education.
Don't tell lies. Tell the truth.
I have my passport.
I don't work the same hours every day.
The mirror is very dirty.
It could get worse.
Tom forgot to turn the light off.
I'm fasting.
Don't you want to know what it is?
Tom has passed out.
We pitted cherries for the pie.
It was partly my fault.
We were witnesses of the accident.
Tom knew that he'd be late.
They disappeared.
There wasn't anybody in that room.
Tom knows what Mary's car looks like.
I bet everything will turn out well.
Who is that lady?
Can I see the message?
Stop acting like such a weirdo.
Get off my car.
What does it feel like?
Thanks for your quick answer.
How many pictures do you need?
We use a lot of water every day.
Do you agree?
I need paint.
Tom fell out of the tree.
Maybe you should buy it.
What did you think Tom would do?
I changed my clothes.
I know your language.
I think you need to go home now.
I can look after myself now.
Tom is only trying to protect you.
That's what I like about you.
We'll help you.
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
The others weren't so lucky.
What will they do to us?
Tom is very annoying.
Tom expected at least a ten percent return on his investment.
How long do you think it would take you to paint my house?
He lives in luxury.
You aren't allowed in this room.
You're taunting me.
She sat next to him with her eyes closed.
We have no alternative but to work.
Where is the nearest subway station?
That was fast.
What languages can you speak?
Team members are provided with equipment and uniforms.
That bus will take you to the zoo.
I'm invited to a party tonight.
I still read every day.
You were very helpful.
Some people dream of having a house on a hill.
Are you going to sing here?
Riding double on a bicycle is dangerous.
I was suspended from work for a week.
I know you were proud of me.
I think it's a warning.
How many times a week does Tom kiss Mary?
I'm homesick.
Be careful when you cross the bridge.
I'll keep trying.
Attack is the best form of defense.
Tom put the gun down.
I don't want to scare them.
Who left the window open?
Are you tired?
It's just your imagination.
Tom said that he couldn't speak French.
Tom helped us do it.
I can't buy it because I have no money.
Do you know why Tom and I were arguing?
How are you?
I'd like to make a speech.
One of the dogs started barking.
My boat is small.
Tom is our hero.
He likes to cook for his family.
I was a little surprised.
You're still taller than me.
I told Tom why I went to Australia.
Tom doesn't know what to say.
Category 5 hurricanes are the worst.
I don't want to wait till the last minute.
Please give me some hints.
There's an orange on the table.
Tom wasn't able to answer any of the questions.
I'm not your teacher anymore.
I didn't realize you were interested in it.
You've given me your cold.
What are you going to say to Tom?
That doesn't happen in this part of the country.
We didn't want to do that.
Empty your pockets.
She is very pretty.
That happened a week ago.
I only want to help.
It's a happy thing.
My father took us to the zoo.
She was injured in a fall.
Ask Tom if we can speak French.
I don't feel like eating out this evening.
Tell Tom why.
I've already explained it to you twice.
I'm working on another project now.
I couldn't let Tom go.
How did you celebrate New Year's Eve?
Both pieces are made of metal.
How did you and Tom get here?
I'd like to buy that one.
Tom was late for dinner.
It is necessary to know our enemies if we want to defeat them.
Tom is really serious about learning French.
I think Tom has a girlfriend already.
I went to the beach.
Tom is a bit busy, so he can't help you today.
He introduced his daughter to me.
Tom tried to solve the problem.
I asked Tom to be here 45 minutes ago.
It's amazing.
I'd like three bags of potato chips.
Tom doesn't live with his wife anymore.
Do you have one?
We'll get this one.
"How old are you?" "I'm 16 years old."
She tempted him.
You've got to trust me.
This isn't what I asked for.
Who have you invited to your birthday party?
I will go tomorrow morning at seven.
Your guests are waiting.
If I were you, I'd call a doctor.
I'd advise you not to start anything you can't finish.
He trusted you.
I'm going to my place.
I guess Tom will have to do that.
They kissed in the rain.
Everybody knew her true feelings.
Why don't you believe me?
I was a coal miner for thirty years.
How far did Tom go?
Tom lost the race.
I'm going to kill myself.
I'm a creative guy.
He will come back in a few days.
Did Tom and Mary leave early?
Are you kidding me?
I'm not drunk.
Some of our members weren't at the meeting.
They made me go there alone.
Control your emotions.
Tom is a true gentleman.
No kidding?
Tom's not feeling very well.
Tom was fired because he often showed up late for work.
Tom was supposed to be here by noon.
We walked around the pond.
That's my favorite blue shirt.
We work in a factory.
I guess I should get back to work.
Thanks for nothing.
Tom still loved Mary.
None of them know French.
Tom was about to do that.
She teaches reading and writing.
What's the worst movie you've ever seen?
The police interrogated Tom for three hours.
My father is a bus driver.
Tom recommended that we not do that.
What did your wife say?
Tom was talking to himself.
Tom said he'd consult a lawyer.
I have told you everything I know about Germany.
I don't have to study French.
Clark Kent is the hero of the Superman stories.
It is absurd to try to persuade them.
What do you guys want to eat?
Do those girls wear white skirts?
She took care of my dog.
Tom should be in the lab.
I've been wanting to meet you for years.
The party is just beginning.
Do you use a deodorant?
What time can you come?
You ruined everything.
I weigh about 60 kilos.
Did you find your contact lenses?
What an adorable child!
I know you're probably mad about what I said yesterday.
Do you want it?
What're you good at?
I know you're here, Tom.
No one will get hurt.
It was nice talking to you.
You should have listened to me.
We met at summer camp.
That's not how I want things to be.
Tom sat a few feet away from the door.
Maybe we should wait.
Where is my clock?
It goes without saying that money cannot buy happiness.
I have never seen a red refrigerator.
I found him lying on the bed.
I'm studying English.
I wouldn't tell Tom about that if I were you.
You must come without fail.
You live in Boston now, don't you?
I want to know who gave you that.
What can we do?
Do you think I'm getting fat?
Tom is writing to a friend.
Try it out yourself.
We'll just follow you.
We all know Tom.
This isn't the best one we have.
The more curious you are, the better.
I didn't say it would be easy.
He was so immature, he couldn't resist the temptation.
I hurt my elbow.
When did Tom get back?
I was convinced by his explanation.
My brother is a professor.
Who paid your tuition?
Please stand.
Who did it?
I hope that the weather stays this way.
A few days later, Tom found a new job.
Tom peeled the potatoes.
I like my coffee weak.
The house is on fire!
Keep going.
I can sleep anywhere.
I am willing to help you.
The boy tried moving the heavy sofa.
I love your name.
What time do you think that you'll get to Boston?
I consider Tom a friend.
Let's play football today.
When you come back, I'll be gone.
We visit Tom from time to time.
Tom used to hate Mary. Now he loves her.
I sometimes walk to school and sometimes ride my bicycle.
The calf was born this morning.
Please be very careful.
I'll be right here.
I don't work on weekends.
Do it with me.
Did Tom have any history of heart problems?
Behave yourself.
It looks like Tom was wrong.
We're married.
Tom isn't a diligent student.
You knew I was married.
We're voting today.
Tom opened the drawer and took out a pencil.
Tom soon realized the seriousness of his error.
Tom bought a Turkish rug.
They don't like Tom.
I gave everything away.
Tom was seriously hurt.
I didn't know you didn't live in Boston anymore.
Tom lives in a slum.
I know all that.
Tom was walking too fast for me to catch up with him.
Have you finished your English homework yet?
How do you do that?
This is the book Tom gave me.
I don't know if it's possible.
Tom wants someone to love him.
He can read.
No one can understand your letter.
I'll have to do it myself.
Tom said you're very stubborn.
We don't have to do this.
You must study French.
Why don't you mind your own business?
Have you had dinner already?
He is getting better.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
I think you should speak a bit more slowly.
I don't want you to think I'm not happy with your decision.
Tom didn't remember whether the room was empty or not.
I often go skiing in the winter.
I think granola bars are healthy.
Could you explain to me what happened?
I failed.
Which language do you speak the most often?
I'm still having fun.
I am in the classroom.
I don't want to be negative.
What am I going to do with this?
I know this song.
Tom wants to know what happened to Mary.
If he had worked harder, he might be a rich man now.
I'm a vegetarian.
People like to talk to you.
Tom and John must be brothers.
Tom doesn't seem to understand French.
Tom lives in a rural area.
Don't take this.
I'd like to visit Australia some day.
What are you looking at?
I honestly don't know.
I wonder why Tom shouldn't do that.
I speak French very poorly.
Tom went on board.
Tom was waiting for me to help him.
The faucet is leaking.
This is an important discussion.
Tom talked to Mary in French.
She is an admirable woman.
He misses his family very much.
Don't leave me behind!
You're back again.
I know that Tom is stoned.
There was a traffic jam.
I forgot to tell you the babysitter's name.
She was already in love with him.
My name is Tom and this is Mary.
I climbed the tree.
I'm sorry that you can't come this evening.
Are you sure that you want to do this?
You are free to say what you think.
We need experts.
We love Tom.
Tom is photogenic, isn't he?
I owe my life to you.
They'll be fine.
Who is the group leader?
No one has a perfect body.
Tom is an experienced climber.
The wife of your son is your daughter-in-law.
Tom is trying on shoes.
He came home late last night.
Can you speak slowly, please?
I don't have to be here.
What did you choose to do?
I don't know when I'll be able to help you.
The U.N. monitored the country's elections.
Tom thanked the manager.
He learned to swim.
This is for you, Tom.
We still don't know the truth.
I'm going to my sister's wedding this weekend.
I want to go to Boston, too.
This is easy. It's like taking candy from a baby.
The only one who has a problem is you.
I got very excited.
Tom pretended to understand Mary's poem.
Tom turned the faucet on.
I have no authority to do that.
Don't make noise here.
We need to talk.
Tom is working at a supermarket now.
Do you know what his name is?
Someone grabbed me from behind.
It's a sunny day.
What's your favorite Christmas carol?
That's not important.
Is there anything you want to ask me?
Tell Tom that I'm ready.
I think that I'm going to stop now.
The pain is something I'll never forget.
"Do you like traveling?" "Yes, I do."
Tom doesn't live there anymore.
I don't want to go bald.
Tom is a responsible driver.
Would you like to eat something?
Tom is inspired.
I don't understand a word.
Tom isn't too tall.
I bought her a clock.
I decided to take his side against the others.
Tom has got to get out of here.
You're going with me, aren't you?
She looks young, but she's actually older than you are.
I need that tape.
Think about your future.
She gave him a lot of money.
You have to go alone.
I beat him at chess.
Since there were no customers, we closed the shop early.
I met him when I was a student.
Our bus arrived a little early.
Tom wasn't sitting on the floor.
You actually did that to yourself.
Does it rain there very often?
We count everything.
The broken leg isn't Tom's biggest problem.
We don't have this in Europe.
I don't know why.
I'll never give you permission to do that.
I drive very fast.
He popped the trunk.
Whose phone is this?
Are we making progress?
I'd like to have my hair trimmed.
We've missed our train.
Do what Tom says.
Tom has been gone for three days.
This can't be true.
I demand punctuality.
Can anyone pronounce this word?
May I ask you to do me a favor?
Tom saw the whole thing.
What language do you usually speak at home?
Tom is quite egotistical.
Can you describe the man who took your wallet?
Where are you going?
They've already eaten.
Who are you talking to?
Tom threw his knife at Mary.
Don't leave me alone.
Did you call 911?
I don't want to eat a live lobster.
I didn't think about Tom.
How long has it been since you moved to Boston?
I'd like you to take this.
I wonder what's in that room.
What am I going to do with you?
What's the news?
Sheep feed on grass.
It was a cold evening even though it was summertime.
Why do you study French?
She embraced her brother warmly.
It was cloudy.
I'm doing what I have to.
I'm not going to your house.
I don't know if I could do that.
I like school.
Tom really should've been here by now.
Tom will eat soon.
Tom is reading a book.
With her heart pounding, she opened the door.
Tom went out for lunch.
He's afraid of the sea.
We haven't been invited yet.
Can I open the curtain?
This is my sister's.
I doubt that Tom is still worried.
I think his name is Tom.
I'm sure Tom will be annoyed.
Tom and I've never been apart.
I bet you've never climbed a tree.
Are you scared of something?
Maybe that's exactly what Tom wants.
He forgot to turn off the light.
You don't drink enough water.
Tom's snoring.
I want Tom to stay where he is until I get back.
I am a woman.
Tom won't regret it.
We all want to go home.
He likes walking in the park.
What was Tom wearing?
The poet gave the girl a rose.
Tom saw Mary, and so did John.
I worked in this company for three decades.
I don't remember my mother.
There have been a lot of complaints from consumers that our products don't last as long as we claim.

May I take pictures here?
This room has two closets for clothing.
The more a man has, the more he wants.
I'm tired of listening to all of Tom's bragging.
Tom had no food.
Why don't we get going?
We're not done with this yet.
I'm proud to be Canadian.
The lemonade is cold.
You're through.
Your birthday is coming.
Tom knows that Mary loves him.
These shoes are very comfortable.
It's easy to explain.
I agree with Tom.
You don't care, do you?
Tom is just obeying orders.
Would you open the gate, please?
Tom didn't eat lunch yesterday.
Tom cut his finger when he was opening a can.
Tom complained about the noise.
It won't work.
Tom's password was easy to guess.
Tom wrapped the package with brown paper.
This machine makes 100 copies a minute.
I'm a university student.
I've got nothing against you.
We're tough people.
It's too far.
You must take good care of your health.
It sounds like you're tired.
You don't have to do that, do you?
I'm better.
I want to buy a gift for my girlfriend.
Write carefully and legibly.
They found this.
They went to America last month.
I thought it was Monday today.
Can you believe it? She's even lazier than me.
Everybody knows that Tom likes Mary.
Go brush your teeth.
Let's go home, please.
I knew that my car had been stolen.
Is that a red pen?
Do you still want to be an officer?
What is wrong with you people?
Tom crossed the border illegally.
We hope it doesn't come to that.
You should leave Tom a message.
We were surprised at his conduct.
What do you need exactly?
Tom was told he didn't have to do that.
He wants to learn how to cook.
If you ever need anyone to talk to, feel free to call me.
What game are you playing?
Can Tom speak French?
We'll be heroes.
Have you ordered the pizza yet?
Tom told me that you didn't tell me everything.
I'm extroverted.
Tom likes beans.
I don't think you'd win.
This is the job Tom pays us for.
I am ready.
I forgot my shopping list at home.
Tom heard Mary and John arguing.
What are you thinking about?
Tom got drunk last night.
My grandson loves playing video games.
Tom forgot to bring his camera.
We admire Tom.
I forgot my briefcase.
He plays the piano very well.
This was a really exhausting trip.
Please say hello to her.
What happened was tragic.
I don't usually cry.
How could you be so careless?
They never listen to me.
This dictionary has 12 volumes.
Don't you need money?
Get yourself a decent suit.
Someone put something in my drink.
She's lost her car key.
Tom can't go out today because he's sick.
That was a stupid thing for Tom to do.
Do you envy your neighbors?
There is no salt left.
I know Tom did it on purpose.
That cost a lot more than I expected.
Continue working.
The medicine had an immediate effect.
I lived abroad for ten years.
I ran into some friends at the train station.
Use acrylic paint.
Thanks for dinner.
Don't you like cats?
Tom continued playing.
I gave him what little money I had.
Don't forget to close the door.
What was it you wanted to ask me?
Don't leave here until you've done it.
This watch was your grandfather's.
Where were you when I needed your help?
We were lucky.
No one called the police.
Tom is young, but he's pretty smart.
The thief ran away.
The situation is worse than we believed.
Perhaps Tom will do that tomorrow.
Tom would like to have a word with you.
I'm sorry I've kept you waiting so long.
Tom actually hardly ever studies.
I never went there again.
Do you want these?
Tom was very concerned.
I lost my way in New York.
Who called the cops?
Tom felt himself weakening.
Tom stopped recording.
I can't get used to my new apartment.
I'm no liar.
Tom couldn't remember, but Mary did.
Tell Tom what happened to Mary.
I'm against the bill.
We had to react quickly.
You'd better be right about this.
Tom likes to eat out.
I have a complicated matter I want to discuss with you.
Have you ever climbed a mountain?
Tom told me he had a plan.
Four multiplied by two is eight.
I don't like mathematics very much.
Does Tom have any sisters?
You have no right to tell me what to do.
He disregarded my advice.
You could at least try to be a bit more polite, even though it's not like you.
Just looking at her, you can see that she loves you.
Tom probably won't even try talking to Mary.
Are you coming alone or with someone else?
When do you work?
Tom ate a piece of the cake that Mary baked.
Tom didn't recognize me.
I love to float in the water.
We were busy.
When did they go?
I forbid you to smoke.
I don't want what I'm about to say to be recorded.
I've been living in this house since last month.
I like to write poems.
He who desires too much, gets nothing.
Soldiers are used to danger.
Do you have a better plan?
I want you to die.
His position enabled him to do so.
Tom was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
I couldn't do that, but Tom could.
I can't figure out how to upload an image.
I put the key on the table.
We've taken care of all the details.
How was today's test?
That can be done.
Please go away.
I can prove I'm right.
You cannot kill yourself by holding your breath.
Were you able to do anything for Tom?
Tom and Mary had an enjoyable day together at the zoo.
I want to live in a small town.
He has more than five dictionaries.
I already know what happened.
I didn't know how to react.
I'm sure Tom will be depressed.
Tom lives in a bad neighborhood.
A good password should be difficult to guess, but easy to remember.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom took off his T-shirt.
Most people think that it's OK to eat meat.
Does Tom drive a station wagon?
Tom dug up the potatoes.
Not all Canadians are tall.
Do you read a lot of books?
Don't go home yet.
You look like Tom.
I still don't have a plan.
I have two dogs, three cats, and six chickens.
Is it true that you're moving to Australia?
We can do better.
I aimed at the tiger and fired, but missed him.
What choice do I have?
Tom handed Mary something.
I live in a small town.
I was afraid I might not be able to do it correctly.
Tom kicked Mary.
You may go.
We're going to need it.
What was the name of the last song you sang?
I had to see a doctor yesterday.
Tom is stuck-up, isn't he?
Add a bit of sugar, please.
Have you ever been to Canada?
Tom earned good money.
I've already got a place to live.
Tom has lots of friends in Boston.
I want you to help Tom.
I'm feeling tired.
I was really late.
They're eating their apples.
I'll see Tom again on October 20th.
Why didn't you mention that?
I don't think Tom is hiding anything.
Tom knows how to fix it.
Of course, I had a good time.
The curse was broken.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Tom.
Tom did it for money.
Your ideas are a little antiquated.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
That's the ugliest dress that I've ever seen.
Tom has betrayed me.
Father is going to undergo an operation.
You're the only one who understands me.
I wasn't asleep.
You can see the island in the distance.
It's making me nervous.
You've been there.
I don't believe it any longer.
Tom bought me a hotdog.
This is a fork.
Please wait until Monday to do that.
Tom should live in Boston with us.
Tom spoke without thinking.
Who's that girl?
Tom has a wife and three kids.
Tom went to Boston by car.
I'm sure everything will be OK now.
He's my friend. Do you know him?
We saw Tom get on the bus.
We've just finished doing that.
English is not my native language.
They sang songs around the fire.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
We have an important matter to discuss.
I've got to get something to eat.
There are a lot of people waiting outside.
Tom told me you and Mary were dating.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
Nobody was snoring.
Do you like your teachers?
I've decided to do that.
The number of women who become mothers is small.
I think I'll go buy something to eat.
Tom didn't need to go away.
Thanks to both of you.
Your question is hard to answer.
Where's Tom going to live?
Are those yours?
When does the concert begin?
It's freezing out here.
I want to thank you for coming here.
Tom might not know Mary.
Tom apparently waited.
How much did Tom pay you to mow his lawn?
Who's this one?
The rocket was launched this morning.
Tom may have been hurt.
Tom died when he was very young.
Tom never even tried to help me.
I just wanted to be sure.
I did what was necessary.
You'd never lie to me, would you?
There was blood all over the floor.
Tom isn't photogenic.
He's looking for a place to live.
When the phone rang, he ran to answer it.
Don't be so selfish.
Tom has my book.
I have a slight fever.
Do you have some wine?
I'm going to use your phone.
I have a pain here.
Tom asked me if I was sleepy.
Tom was found with the murder weapon.
Could you bring me a glass of water?
I used to enjoy driving.
She is in need of help.
Tom didn't know anything about Mary's past.
They knew what they were doing.
Tom is still celebrating.
Tom put his iPad on the table.
Let me take your blood pressure.
Would you mind clearing up a few points for me?
If you catch a cold, I'm going to get an earful.
He took out some coins.
I have a dozen reports to read.
Pay attention to what you're doing.
I like it when you sing.
The priest blessed the congregation at the end of the mass.
My luck is turning from bad to worse.
We can't accept all of this.
We're expecting Tom to arrive any day now.
I think we have bought everything we need.
It was really easy.
Could this really happen?
When did you start wearing contact lenses?
Tom doesn't have to call Mary tomorrow.
You have the right to know.
Where are your kids?
Tom didn't remember where he'd put his passport.
I wonder if Prince William lets anyone call him Bill.
I didn't think Tom was embarrassed.
What kind of candy is your favorite?
We had a friendly talk with the gentleman.
I knew we'd win.
Use the front door.
Tom didn't get up early enough to catch the first train.
It's time for us to go to bed.
All the students forgot to read that book.
I know Tom can do that.
You stole the money, didn't you?
Didn't you know that Tom had a lot of cats?
An enemy of an enemy is not necessarily an ally.
No one thinks so.
There's nothing I can do to help them.
This honey is very thick.
I'll take care of your children tonight.
Tom won't be here all afternoon.
You're so generous.
If you mix blue and red, you'll get purple.
It's harder to close a business than it is to start one.
We care about you, Tom.
Tom has some goats.
Tom's answers were wrong.
The boy singing a song is my brother.
Tom said you were busy.
Tom came yesterday.
Tom doesn't know anybody here.
Is this spinach?
I want to find out who broke the window.
I hope nobody saw me break the window.
I don't think I want to go.
I plan to go back to Australia as soon as I can.
Tom gets paid a lot to do that.
Tom grew up speaking both English and French.
If you're busy, I can come back later.
Why did Tom ask that question?
Tom lost the bet.
Have you spoken to your parents about this?
I'll be ready on Monday.
I don't like watching TV.
I hope we can do this again soon.
You won't be able to bribe Tom.
Mary is still your girlfriend, isn't she?
Is Tom a vegetarian?
Tom said he saw policemen outside.
I'm not good at expressing my feelings.
The sun will come up soon.
I paid my son 5 dollars to wash my car.
When can I see you again?
Please come to my office in the afternoon.
The situation won't change.
Tom couldn't have done that better.
This is one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen.
I don't know if I'll have kids.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
Do you know what happened?
I'm going to rest today.
The park is in the center of the city.
It stinks in here.
I want to meet Tom as soon as possible.
I don't know. Let me check.
He got me a watch.
I won't tell you why.
I know you've been trying to help.
If I could be that guy instead of me.
He left his hometown at the age of fifteen never to return.
We took advantage of the good weather to play tennis.
I think I won't be able to do this.
Tom acted out of character.
Are you experienced?
Keep Tom out of here.
I don't want to see your faces.
Tom allowed Mary to play his guitar.
Did you go to the beach alone?
Thank you.
What time do you want me to be here?
I think that's horrible.
It's obvious that Tom is not interested in girls.
I read lips.
I think it's worth it.
This flower is beautiful, isn't it?
Tom used to live in Boston.
I'm sure of my rights.
There is little hope.
The school is two kilometers ahead.
She left the room.
I asked for Tom's help.
What kind of food would you like to eat?
Playing cards is interesting.
They know who they are.
They understood my plight.
You are the one that I was looking for.
That's not the point.
You know that I have to go.
Tom and Mary are both here.
I took a bath.
Tom is a doctor, isn't he?
I thought Tom wouldn't enjoy the movie.
I'm going to be working late.
Who really cares?
Latin Americans know very little about the history of the indigenous peoples who used to live here several centuries ago.
I can't hear you.
How is Tom feeling?
I'll call you a cab.
I don't know when Tom and Mary met.
I've heard this song before.
Tom had jet lag.
I'm claustrophobic.
Who have you helped lately?
Would you like to do something interesting today?
You don't need to do it.
There'll come a day when you'll regret doing that.
Some people don't like that.
I rolled the dice.
What should we do now?
Everyone does that.
They're all waiting for you.
Cats sleep a lot.
Life has its ups and downs.
Tom is very pale.
They live nearby.
What should Tom do now?
I bought a few eggs and a little milk.
You seem very tired.
Tom is a troublemaker.
My ring is gone.
Tom wants to study abroad.
Police continued their investigation.
There was a terrible accident on the freeway.
I went straight to bed.
That song is my favorite.
Did Tom understand that?
Do you know who invented the microscope?
I promise you I'll never leave you.
I wonder where Tom and Mary are now.
I got a nasty sting from a wasp.
Tom and Mary were classmates.
Give us three minutes.
Tom has been doing that very well.
Tom vomited.
There's a beautiful meadow behind the house.
I had no idea Tom was Mary's husband.
Tom doesn't like me that much.
The chicken laid an egg this morning.
I heard that Tom moved to Boston.
Tom is just kidding.
I do that off and on.
French isn't taught in our schools.
Tom spends money as soon as he gets it.
When she heard the news, she was not happy.
I slept only two hours.
Can you talk to Tom?
No one's in the bath.
Everybody began boarding the bus.
The war had lasted four years.
Don't read in the dark. It's not good for your eyes.
He opened the door.
Aren't you busy?
How did you get to know about her?
I'll bring lunch.
I work in the morning.
Who caused the accident?
You must be more careful from now on.
She gave him a sweater.
Tom often runs into Mary at the supermarket.
I asked what he was going to do.
Mary was able to swim across the river.
We bought a new washer.
It is rude of him not to give me a call.
All the people who were here have left.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Tom told me you cried.
Misery and sorrow accompany war.
That's a supposition, not a fact.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
Tom probably thought I was at school.
I can handle Tom myself.
Do you still want us to help Tom?
Do you still have it?
She spoke English to me just to show off.
This turkey is delicious.
I'll be seeing Tom tomorrow.
Do you understand what's happening here?
I'd never ever sing a song like that.
Tom called Mary from the airport.
Tom and Mary both teach at the same school.
Open your eyes.
Gesture is another way of communication.
Tom vacuumed the carpet.
Tom and I have a plan.
Everybody likes you.
I don't want to lose you ever again.
Let's ask some questions.
Tom asked me if I thought Mary was beautiful.
Please go ahead without me.
Are you going to do it?
Tom was plowing.
Tom would never have hurt you.
Tom has green eyes.
I've got an appointment.
I like surfing.
Do you have a credit card?
I think Tom likes his job.
I am trying to make it out.
Tom pretended to be thinking hard.
I passed the exam.
When can we start?
I paid him five dollars.
Tom is being evasive again.
Tom shrugged.
Tom blamed Mary for the accident that killed their son.
Grab my hand.
I wasn't careful.
You're needy.
The movie was good.
Tom enjoyed himself.
I was born blind.
Thanks for the food.
Please don't leave me here with Tom.
Is it okay if I take a break?
It didn't really work for us.
Hold the vase with both hands.
I took an arrow in the knee.
No one finds this interesting.
Many children at this school are malnourished.
You know where the problem lies.
Please don't be sad any more.
I'm sick of eating watermelon.
Will you swim?
We were surprised at his conduct.
Are you sure you don't want to go to Boston with Tom?
Let's hide inside this cave.
Tom said Mary would come.
Do you like mine?
Will you give it to me?
You must never forget that.
Tom won't likely be doing that now.
I'm pretty sure Tom is bluffing.
Tom didn't want to go either.
It's free of charge.
You have to stop them.
Someone's knocking on the door.
My dogs are white.
I don't believe that you only bought that.
There is a cat under the bed.
Did you just call me lazy?
What did I miss?
I don't have to answer your question.
I want something cold to drink.
The audience began to laugh.
Tom showed Mary the note that he found under his windshield wiper.
Is that a bat?
Tom is on cloud nine.
We're the same age.
I baked these cookies for you.
I just want Tom to get well.
Which store did you buy that at?
You should come back here again.
The pen is on the table.
We just moved in.
Tom, you're not funny.
Tom was aware Mary was in the hospital.
Can I borrow your pen?
You have to disappear.
What makes you think that's what caused the fire?
I was disqualified.
I'm going to brush my teeth.
Tom warned Mary not to be late.
He put milk in his coffee.
I wish he were here now.
Please be honest with yourselves.
You're not good enough for my daughter.
It was very cold yesterday morning.
I'm not going to help Tom.
I've never felt so good in my life.
I'd like you to be there.
Tom lost.
You'd better take another look.
Jackson is my family name.
I feel homesick.
Tom retired on October 20, 2013.
What can you teach me?
When did you go there?
Should you be here?
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for us.
We're here.
I wrote a letter to my teacher.
Tom has moved to Boston.
Are those yours?
Tom was ordered to leave, but he refused.
Tom and his friends were playing cards.
We're going to have fun.
I'm beginning to suspect that that isn't going to happen.
I'll be whatever you want me to be.
Everything is OK.
Is it true that Tom tried to drown himself?
Sit on the bench.
You're in better shape than I am.
We went to Australia last summer.
Tom knew he was about to die.
I'll need help.
Please listen to me.
I believe that statement.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
What can I do to protect myself and my family if someone breaks into my house?
Those are the people you have to talk to.
I think I understood.
Were you the one who chose this?
We have a few questions.
Would you like to go to a movie tomorrow night?
What are you having for lunch today?
May I sit in the back?
I don't want to be rich.
What's the matter with you?
I felt like I was going to die.
Tom spent the afternoon cleaning his room.
The driver of the bus wasn't injured.
We were waiting for you.
We all make decisions based on our personal experiences.
What are your favorite movies?
I don't want to go by myself.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't like to socialize.
We've never given a concert in Boston.
They seem to be in a bad mood today.
So it seems to me.
Tom was afraid that people would laugh at him.
We're going to make it.
Let me look at you.
I needed more time.
Keep digging.
This product is made in Italy.
This tastes good.
She has been practicing the piano since morning.
I ate a hamburger.

I have some free time right now.
I tried to sing that new song that Tom wrote.
This building is near completion.
All in all, I thought it was a good book.
Tom is going to help me.
I was hungry and thirsty.
When can I see you?
Tom kicked in the door.
What do you have to eat? I'm hungry.
We're sincere.
Where do I go then?
It was not until recently that she changed her mind.
We have the opposite problem.
I don't know the way.
Let Tom finish.
Can you show me the way?
Tom expected more.
Tom says it's OK.
Who's your teacher?
I don't know exactly.
I think Tom has made a mistake.
That isn't the goal.
What are they going to do?
We've studied French for several years.
Tom is the one that doesn't like me.
I want my money back.
I have borrowed two books.
Tom opened the door and entered the office.
To add a sentence to your list of favorites, click on the white heart icon.
A few days ago, you didn't even want to talk to me.
I can't see.
I'll go there tomorrow.
I wasn't hungry.
I love it when that happens.
I'd never ask Tom to do that.
It has been many years since she died.
She put all her jewels into a little red box.
Is this our hotel?
I haven't done that since last year.
I didn't like Boston very much.
Who did you invite to your birthday party?
You're a scoundrel.
I will have to help them.

I want you to be my wife.
I knew that was Tom.
Everybody is doing that.
Can I do anything?
This megaphone doesn't work.
How old are your parents?
Do you know who stole my bicycle?
I don't feel vulnerable.
Light the candles.
Tom and Mary are very happy.
I can't stop thinking about the stolen money.
The police think that Tom has killed several people.
Tom told me he likes you a lot.
He dropped his books on the floor.
You don't seem to be as impressed as Tom seems to be.
This taught me a good lesson.
He asked me who that man was.
Tom doesn't want to swim.
I will go to New York next week.
Tom returned to work on October 20th.
She has a strong personality.
You're a genius.
Is there anything I can do for you?

He once lied and told her a rare creature lived in her closet.
He has a Japanese car.
Don't do that.
The hen hatched five eggs.
Are you home?

I had to respect Tom's wishes.
I wish we had more time together.
These things only happen to me.
Tom died a number of years ago.
I have been in Japan for two months.
We are speaking on behalf of the young people of Australia.
Did Tom wink at you?
A few days later, he came.
I invited him to my house.
We have to tell them something.
I'm sure we'd be able to do this if we had Tom's help.
Why do you ask?
Tom was arrested in 2013.
I'm going to give them to you.
Tom is the one who convinced me to learn French.
Where did it come from?
What's your last name, Tom?
I waited for three hours.
We want to see Tom win.
Both of them survived.
Do you still live in Australia?
Have you ever eaten teppanyaki?
Tom and Mary don't like you.
You can't park around here.
Mary is still living at home with her parents.
I hate people who do that kind of thing.
Let's all go to Boston together.
Only one little boy survived the traffic accident.
They won't let Tom out.
Someone asked for you.
Maybe we should get there early.
I asked Tom the same question.
Please come home sometimes.
I can wait for you.
Be sensible.
This one's Tom's.

Is it raining?
I don't want to call the police.

The island is situated five kilometers off the coast.
She is older and wiser now.
I like these.
So do you also speak English?
He was a good friend.
I won't tell you this again.
Tom never asked.
I'm not going to show you how to do it.
He is good at golf.
Why didn't anybody tell me?
I screamed.
All I want now is a little sleep.
Tom followed the instructions.
Did you get fired from your last job?
Did you choose an interesting book for your son?
Tom betrayed you.
I'd better get to bed soon.
You're able to do that, aren't you?
I have a lot of homework.
This is not funny anymore.

His brother works for a trading company.
Tom watched admiringly.
I almost got hit by a car.
We have a lot of snow in February.
Get her out of here.

Tom did it more than once.

Your essay has some mistakes, but as a whole it is very good.
I've never been to Paris.
I'm not the one who did that.
I hope no one saw you come in here.

I can't buy it because I don't have any money.
I came home by bus.
His way of speaking offended me.
She has two thousand books.
That isn't allowed, is it?
The boy put his hand in his pocket.
I have the impression that he knows the secret.
Tom's the man.
Don't you have classes today?
Tom asked me to wake him up for breakfast.
Do I know Tom?
Shouldn't we try to help Tom?
You'd better not go there again.
Do you really think Tom is impressed?
Tom took off his sunglasses.
Are you done, Tom?
Are you free tomorrow?

That was the only thing I had to do.

What was Tom describing?
I am no better than a beggar.
Tom is three years older than I am.
Values can't be changed overnight.
