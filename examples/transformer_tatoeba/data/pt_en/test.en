It's going to be very difficult to explain .
Where are you guys now ?
Tom didn't seem too concerned .
I got out of the bath and put my clothes back on .
How old are you ?
Which one should I use ?
Tom won't have to do that again , I assure you .
Tom was told not to do that anymore .
It's all over for you .

Tom said that he was feeling great .

Go and see who it is .
Tom told me he loved me .
I'm kind of busy .
Do you know where I might find small cowboy boots ?
I wouldn't wear that ugly coat even if I were very cold .
Why are you pretending you can't understand French ?
What did you want to say to me yesterday ?
We haven't started yet .
We're right .
The damage amounted to five million yen .
Do you work with Tom ?
I'll call you as soon as I can .
You're illiterate .
Play it again .
The train is sure going fast .
It's your fault .
Have fun while you can .

I'm going to be done soon .
What's wrong with me ?
Tom showed us a few card tricks .
Let's go down the stairs slowly .
Tom had to wait for Mary .
Tom knows better than to disagree with Mary .
How did you get in my house ?
Have you ever tried not being rude to people ?
Tom already regrets what he did .
I tried to run fast .
Maybe now Tom will be in the mood to talk .
I got up and headed toward the door .
I hurt my knee .
Send me a postcard .
I like a lot of things .
I think it's time for me to leave now .
Tom can't remember anything Mary said .
We waited patiently for Tom to arrive .
I'm not interested in doing that with Tom .
I think Tom is still alive .
I didn't know you two knew each other .
Tom was smoking .
I don't know either of them .

What I want is a big juicy steak .
I wasn't writing anything .
I knew that I had something to do .
To edit a sentence , click on the pencil icon .
That's a doll .
Tom knew it was impossible .
Tom and Mary know about it .
I'll show my album to you .
Don't show off .
I told Tom I wasn't the one who did that .
Is Tom still awake ?
That happened in October .
That isn't the way my grandmother made stuffing .
I'd just like to be able to save a little money .
Their contract expired on October 20th .

You may swim .
The furniture was dusty .
I bought some paintings for my apartment .
I'm kidding .
I've already decided what to do .
No one saw anything .
How did you get this picture ?
I was starting to lose hope .
My father and mother are dead .
She writes music for a living .
It isn't there .
He will be a good husband .
I thought you'd be in Boston this week .

It is yet to be seen whether this plan will succeed or not .

Do you have to do that now ?
May I use your phone ?

We work together .
Let me see if I can find it .
I don't want any more trouble with Tom .
He's two years older than I am .
Didn't you hear what I said ?
Where is my beer ?
I think it's very impressive .
I know we're different .
We've studied French for several years .
I'll get off at the next station .
It's hot in here .
I'm sorry to bother you again .
I'm sure things will work out .

You can't go .
The children loved it .
It's worse than that .
Was your mother an only child ?
It's almost six o'clock .
This is horrible .

Why would you need to know that ?
He avoided looking at her .
I apologize for the delay .
I have three questions .
Why is the store closed ?
Can I come with you ?
There are two thousand books .
Why didn't I think of that ?
Few people visit me these days .
It is nothing but a joke .
It's what I want .
I don't believe in fairy tales .
Did you expect something else ?
Some of the college students who are caught cheating on the exams do not even blush .

I'll do whatever Tom asks of me to do .
Why should we care ?
Why did Tom commit suicide ?
That shouldn't be too difficult .

I don't cook every day .

We make milk into cheese and butter .
Do you know how many people live in Australia ?
He gives us money .
He is kind .
You look more like your father than your mother .
I'd like to dance with you .
Have a look .

I thought I was your best friend .
I have a house .

Thank you for the other day .
Who's at the door ?
You're old .
Tom , you've got to help me .
I don't watch TV as much as I used to when I was a kid .
It'd be murder .
Let's play .
What kind of videogames do you play ?
Tom was thinking of Mary .
What languages can Tom speak ?
What food do you like most ?
Tom left in a taxi .
I won't tell you my real name .
I'm going to defeat you .
I'm not very busy .
Get out of here . I need some peace and quiet .
I'm training for a triathlon .
Do I have to make a speech ?
I don't think being poor is anything to be ashamed of .
I don't want to let Tom go .
You were shouting at her and I don't like that .
Do you remember the night you were attacked ?
Time flies .
I'll study your report .
He will have to get up early tomorrow .
Did Tom go to Boston with you ?
Stick to the facts .
You'll get tired .
I wish that I had had more time to help you .
I wonder if you're truly happy .
Tom's parents are both dead .
I like being part of this group .
Tom tried to pry open the box with a crowbar .
I need to find some new friends .
They're joking .
I'm alone here .
I got jealous .
If a cut is bleeding , put pressure on it .
I also noticed that .
Tom and Mary both know John .
Can you play the organ ?
They live in a rented house .
What's your answer , Tom ?
What did Tom do then ?
I have to do what's right .
She is afraid of her own shadow .
I'll see you next Wednesday .
I traveled around Europe .
You don't actually think I'm going to let you do that , do you ?
Go up these stairs .
I want to see you again .
Man , are you OK ?
Everyone escaped .
This is all for you .
I sincerely hope that you will soon recover from your illness .
He listened to music in his room .
We were worried about Tom .
Park next to my car .
Tom left about an hour ago .
That's not cool .
Can you gather all of the papers together ?
Where is your school ?
I like that dog .
Tom opened the fridge .
I'm following you .
Would you close the gate , please ?
You asked too many questions .
You shouldn't thank me . You should thank Tom .
Aren't you going to eat that piece of pie ?
How much did you pay ?
Tom will probably be reasonable .
I spent a lot of money remodeling my house .
Why do you care ?
I have to rehearse .
Didn't you use to have a car ?
He keeps on asking me for money .
I don't think Tom knows what Mary did .
All the English teachers at my son's school are native speakers .
Don't tell me you don't know it .
Tom came in and sat down on one of the chairs .
I know that Tom is obnoxious .
Aren't you ready to begin ?
It isn't likely our team will win .

You can't just change your mind .
My home is far away .
Don't you want to go to Boston ?
It was no bigger than a soccer ball .
I wonder where Tom is going .
He is playing music .

I enjoy that .

You think you know me pretty well , don't you ?
I wouldn't blame them .
I make a lot of money .
The trouble is that you are too young .
That isn't something you forget .
Tom wanted to study with Mary .
Tom isn't allowed to do that anymore .
When was the last time you spent any time with Tom ?
Tom is a man with many talents .
Tom has been in the pool almost all morning .
I know you're writing a book .
Tom says that he's in love with Mary .
My house is dirty .
Tom found something better .
I think Tom still believes that .
He is a scientist .
Your hair's not even wet .
It's a fine day today .
I have a collection of sand dollars .
A link can join two pieces of chain together .
It looks like Tom is in love .
Computers are complex machines .
My bedroom is dark .
Tom wanted everybody to leave .
She made tea for me .
Thousands of jobs were created .
We're tired .
I didn't think I could do it .
Do you love me at all ?
I bumped into him at the station .
I've made a mistake in my calculations .
Is that good or bad ?
It was amazing .
Tom scored three goals .
I don't believe it !
Tom isn't left-handed .
I don't think Tom is irritated .
Tom is under surveillance .
Why did you come here ?
Tom wasn't hungry either .
We divided the money between us .
I need somebody to help me paint my house .
No prior experience is needed .
I should've never gone to Boston without you .
Tom always does that in the evening .
I don't understand the questions that the teacher asks .
I don't know what they know .
Tom looked very unhappy .
Keep your eyes wide open before marriage and half shut afterwards .
Tom likes sports .
I'm going to try .
Tom didn't give me any advice .
Why didn't you read the magazine ?
She persuaded him to do it even though she knew it wasn't a good idea .
He has to repair the clock .
I don't want to buy a newspaper today .
Please come home .
I want my parents to be proud of me .
Adolescents often quarrel with their parents .
Tom tapped on the window .
Are you listening to music ?
Aren't we friends ?
He does well in physics .
You should've followed Tom's advice .
Who did my dog bite ?
We have a theory .
It was just a shot in the dark .
We hope you'll join us .
Tom kept waiting for three hours .
Has Tom ever asked you to help him ?
I'm going to study French with Tom this evening .
To tell the truth , I'm not in favor of it at all .
Tom says he can stay here two or three nights .
Where's my food ?
I want to make my father proud .
She began crying .
These are cakes that she baked herself .
Tell me about it !
Tom used to hate spinach .
I almost got run over by a truck .
What time does that store open ?
Can't you see that we're speaking ?
Tom's not home .
Tom understood everything .
Can you teach me to play chess ?
Whatever happens , you must keep calm .
Please help yourself .
Do you like this color ?
The party was a success .
It's all right for now .
We didn't order this .
Do I have to be there ?
Bring backup .
I don't have my glasses with me .
How do you relax ?
My uncle lived abroad for many years .
I admit I didn't do what I promised to do .
What did you learn at school today ?
I know you can make it .
Help us , please .
Have you seen Tom's new car ?
The singer is as famous as Madonna .
I am eating a cucumber .
It's advisable to go by train .
Big men are not necessarily strong men .
There's nothing else we have to do .
Look who's awake .
Are you sure Tom can speak French ?
"Let's go" , he said to me .
Wash up .
Tom worked here for three months .
I'm the one who always washes the dishes .
Did you learn that from Tom ?
Tom admitted he was hungry .
If you're wrong , then I'm wrong , too .
We haven't yet had time to do that .
Tom doesn't do that every day .
I know you probably don't want to go .
Money doesn't grow on trees , you know .
I think there's a good possibility that that will happen .
That happened a year ago .
Don't move these books .
You might not want to sing right now .
Tom's team suffered a crushing defeat .
Tom and Mary live in a very nice house .
I'd rather study French with a native French speaker .
Do you want to tell us why we're here ?
If I had the money , I would immediately buy this computer .
We have no choice but to carry on .
Tom is very materialistic .
Keep an eye on the girls .
It doesn't work like that .
What're they going to do to Tom and Mary ?
Is this common ?
Who did you do that for ?
Tom earned a lot of money .
I didn't eat everything that she served me .
My parents don't like my girlfriend .
Mary isn't the right girl for you .
Tom wants me to do it .
Don't climb up the wall .
Who will you give the book to ?
I wish Tom were still alive .
Give me a different one .
I saw him jump .
How many hours did you work last week ?
I received a letter written in English .
Tom no longer lives with me .
Do you know a good restaurant ?
Have you already spent the money Tom gave you ?
Tom couldn't look after himself .
I could hardly tell who was who .
Let's go grab a burger or something .
My grandma gave me this necklace .
Tom is a soldier .
Are you able to solve it ?
We know what you told the police .
All you have to do is follow me .
Tom saw Mary smiling at John .
My favorite music instrument is the flute .
Everyone started arguing .
I agree with some of your opinions .
You were delirious .
Tom couldn't even write his own name .
May I help you ?
I have to cook dinner today .
We're in no hurry .
I don't know the names of all my students .
I'm still in Boston , but I'll be back home tomorrow .
I've had enough of Tom and Mary .
Only a fool doesn't fear the sea .
I wish I hadn't given Tom my phone number .
Tom is a professor at Harvard .
An MP3 file is an audio file .
Tom didn't know that Mary was going to do that .
I had no idea Tom was so strong .
I don't believe that Santa Claus is imaginary .
Can I sleep on the couch ?
Tom wants to stay .
I'd like to try this on .
We're through .
You're arrogant .
Her duty was to look after the children .
I didn't know you were finished doing that already .
We're going to Boston .
The city was bombed by enemy planes .
I'm not talking to you , Tom .
I admit I was surprised .
Are you planning to return to Boston soon ?
The treasure could be anywhere .
Sign on this line .
Just answer the question .
We're both very sleepy .
She was the first one to help him .
I'm the gardener .
Tom is folding his shirt .
The man kept talking for an hour .
Tom is driving me nuts .
Didn't you study history at school ?
Don't trample on the grass .
Tom was probably born in Australia .
I love studying languages .
I haven't yet decided .
I wonder if it'll be nice .
I wasn't interested in seeing Tom .
Tom isn't a stranger .
Do you believe in reincarnation ?
Of course I love you .
Better to die on our feet , than to live on our knees .
"Are you a teacher" ? "Yes , I am" .
I've helped Tom a lot .
I found out how to solve the problem .
Have you ever thought about doing that ?
Tom is drinking some coffee .
She forgot to feed the dog .
Did you enjoy the movie ?
Tom's book got published .
He will arrive there about five o'clock .
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link .
What were you hoping to find ?
I met my classmate .
I wrote to my French teacher in French .
I received a letter informing me of his arrival .
Who'll start ?
We found an anomaly .
We gave a party in celebration of his 70th birthday .
I wonder who'll win .
Tom didn't get upset .
I have a tourist visa .
I need your advice .
I wish I could .
My aunt gave me an album .
My luck is turning from bad to worse .
I hate using adapters .
She stays in touch with him .
Mary kissed her husband's cheek .
Tom doesn't seem to enjoy being here .
I didn't know Tom was so interested in art .
Tom came to see you .
It was a secret .
Did you use to live here ?
He's fresh out of college .
Tom obviously doesn't like Mary very much .
There's a grammatical mistake in that clause .
Won't you join us ?
Tom is a rookie .
You really need a woman .
We should do better .
Look what a mess Tom has made .
Tom didn't attend that meeting .
The train was almost an hour behind time .
Tom was the only one who waited .
Tom gave Mary John's message .
Back then it was different .
They're working hard to get the cable laid in time .
Ten years have gone by since my father died .
Tom began teaching Mary French three years ago .
Why do I get the feeling you don't like Tom very much ?
Tom wanted to read this book .
Why are you so smart ?
It was a little tricky .
You know Tom won't do that , don't you ?
Tom has far more experience than Mary .
Tom fell into the water .
There's a lot at stake .
Tom suggested that I study French .
I told Tom I'd be right back .
Tom has never had a good job .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
What are you smiling at ?
I'm pretty sure that Tom didn't know Mary was going to do that .
Please buy me this book .
The new subway enables me to get to school in 20 minutes .
I'm trying to solve the problem .
I wanted to help Tom out .
I have many books .
Can I look around ?
Tom is a lot of fun , isn't he ?
No one knows what Tom looks like .
Tom is your brother , isn't he ?
Does she know your phone number ?
Tom got lost in the woods .
I'm not very hungry right now .
I want you to do what you have to do .
I listened carefully to Tom .
Tom was playing in the backyard .
Tom doesn't like pasta .
You aren't allowed in there .
I told Tom I was lonely .
I believe her story .
What does this machine do exactly ?
Who could possibly believe this ?
He jumped into the water .
We're anxious .
I don't want any of the stuff Tom gave me .
I am drawing a bird .
Can you tell us where we are ?
Tell Tom he has to wash the dishes .
Do you like my new haircut ?
You can't learn that in school .
The insurance policy does not cover acts of God , such as hurricanes or earthquakes .
How much do you want to spend ?
She blew out all the candles on the birthday cake .
Go out and play .
I tried to stop Tom .
Don't tell us what to do .
I'll take care of my parents when they get old .
When it rains , it pours .
Tom has no diplomatic experience .
I'm sure you're very busy .
She's a fox .
What newspaper do you read ?
I am a writer rather than a teacher .
They say that Isabela died .
What a lot of pens !
I think that Tom was trying to warn us about something .
I'm grateful .
The portions at this restaurant are generous .
You have to get up early .
Which newspaper do you read ?
Have you been married for a long time ?
I didn't know that existed .
Tom can't come to Boston this summer .
Tom told me he was drunk .
Where's the post office ?
Tom can't get his car to start .
I know it'll take a while .
I asked for a beer .
Let me ask you a question .
Who are you working for ?
What's Tom going to say about that ?
Shut the door , please .
How long have you lived in Japan ?
Tom is a creepy person .
I'd like to talk to the head of security .
Be polite , but firm .
I want my phone back .
I never know what to say .
He is an English teacher .
You have beautiful lips .
Nobody would help me , not even Tom .
Tom needs to get a job .
I'm not going to do anything about it .
What prevented you from coming here yesterday ?
Tom got here late .
I want your advice .
I was speechless .
She's caused me a lot of trouble .
Please don't do that today .
If you worry too much , you'll go bald .
Can you tell us your name ?
Give me one good reason .
I found it interesting .
My mother knows how to make cakes .
How did you know I didn't want to go to Boston ?
I don't have Internet access .
I'll cut you some slack .
I don't doubt it .
They love coffee .
How did Tom sprain his ankle ?
Tom hasn't washed his car recently .
I'm sick of hearing the same thing all the time .
Cheer up ! Things aren't as bad as you think .
Did you want to speak with me ?
You shouldn't judge a person by his appearance .
There's another mistake here .
They robbed the jewelry store during the night .
Where's the train station ?
Tom is reading a magazine .
Buy some toys .
Tom is pushing his luck .
Let's take the subway .
I own some very old stamps .
Why did you agree to let Tom win ?
Yesterday I got up early .
Let's hit the sack .
I feel sorry for her .
Tom doesn't live with us anymore .
I know that you don't like me very much .
Have a good Christmas .
Tom has found some interesting discrepancies .
Tom hurt his knee .
Tom must be angry with me .
I just don't get it .
We're late because of you .
You don't like Tom , do you ?
We're very happy with the results .
Do you have many friends ?
How long was the meeting ?
Nobody remembers .
You don't have to do that .
There's one thing I forgot to mention .
Tom could hardly breathe after the race .
He's in the well .
I'm not going to shoot you .
Don't go in .
I found your wallet behind the sofa .
I did take a French class , but I still can't understand French very well .
Tom and I accomplished everything we wanted to .
The cold weather kept us indoors .
I heard what Tom said to you .
Tom took out some coins .
They believed that the earth was flat .
You may always use my dictionary .
Life is short .
Do you want me to comb your hair ?
No , I don't think so .
Look at what you did .
Don't ask for money .
Who's your favorite Disney cartoon character ?
We aren't that poor .
When can I see you ?
I knew they were on the list .
This is where we want to be .
I hope that Tom isn't busy .
He's about the same age as you are .
Tom was a little moody today .
Tom is very responsible .
I take back what I said .
I don't want you to know my real name .
Would you like to come to my beach party this evening ?
Don't use this apparatus near water .
Tom won't stop .
He is subject to fits of anger .
Tom didn't like it .
An idea occurred to me .
What does she do ?
I played the flute .
They will come .
Tom taught me to play chess .
I really appreciate all your help .
I wonder why people always want to know the truth .
I really like that car .
I'll meet with Tom .
Is it damaged ?
Whose turn is it now ?
I'm baking a pie .
If he isn't ill , I think he will come .
I don't want to embarrass you .
Tom is smarter than Mary .
She had an appointment with the doctor .
I just didn't feel like doing that .
I've got no friends .
So , what else do we not know about Tom ?
It's so exciting .
His mother was right .
Tom doesn't know who baked the cake .
Where are they ?
Tom often forgets to lock the front door .
We haven't found it yet .
I think it makes sense .
What languages are spoken in Canada ?
I saw Tom at the library .
Do you need a ride ?
Do they still make cassette tapes ?
Don't move !
Tom told his son not to eat with his mouth open .
The poor peasants ate potatoes .
Tom tried to convince me to do that .
We don't want you to die .
You'll miss Tom .
Are you sisters ?
Someone screamed .
You have to spend more time with your son .
Leave me alone , please .
They were satisfied .
We're going to have a baby .
Are there any bears around here ?
Your French is quite good already .
I intend to stay right here .
My son's rubber duck is yellow .
Tom didn't know when he'd be back .
Follow me .
It's a matter of priorities .
It looks like it'll rain .
Tom doesn't know who we are .
The election was unanimous .
People say I'm crazy .
He still rings me from time to time .
I've seen them .
Tom isn't always late , but he often is .
That'll be hard .
Who was punished ?
You wait and see .
Since I wasn't invited , I'll stay home .
I've been real busy .
We've had plenty of chances to do that .
The door would not open .
The boy playing the guitar is my younger brother .
He explained the rule to me .
This isn't a secret .
I saw my sister tear up the letter .
We'll have to try again .
Mushrooms are in season now .
Don't give up now .
I'm wanted by the police .
I don't yet know what I'm going to do .
Don't you have anything smaller than that ?
What do you weigh ?
It is going to be cold tonight .
It occurred to me that he must have lost the money .
I eat chicken .
I think the time is right to introduce this product .
Can you tell me what's bothering you ?
I met her on my way to school .
I had to go back to Boston .
Do you think Tom will come ?
I want to know what you mean .
Tom is fairly pretentious .
I'm ugly .
The bread is fresh .
Why don't you do something constructive for a change ?
Tom is taller than me .
What are you apologizing for ?
Tom swims as well as Mary .
I must confess I haven't read it yet .
I can talk about anything with my best friend .
What car did he take ?
We need to talk about Tom .
Tom prefers blondes .
Tom has left , but Mary is still here .
She spoke to him about the matter .
Tom ordered steak .
This seems risky .
Tom hid Mary's doll behind the door .
Everybody hates Tom .
I'd like some more butter .
The old building was broken down .
Tom left for a while , but he's already back .
Go that way .
That book is mine .
Bring it here .
Tom's life changed drastically .
Tom has about three hundred books .
Tom nearly had a heart attack when he saw Mary standing on the edge of the roof .
We heard the sound of a distant bell .
I didn't take a nap this afternoon like I usually do .
Don't worry about them .
This room is too dark .
Why can't I go to Boston next summer ?
That was my lunch .
Dinner's ready .
It's a pity that you don't know how to dance .
I know that Tom is a good boss .
The sun has just risen .
I feel very lonely these days .
Give Daddy a kiss .
They smiled at each other .
He has been sick for a week .
Everything was easy .
I hope that we don't into trouble for doing this .
Where did you get these old coins ?
Can I ask something ?
Where did you get all those keys ?
You're the only person I know who can help me .
I wish that I knew what to do next .
I used to be lazy .
The cat was purring .
I heard every word .
I assume that you're Canadian .
The dog was digging a hole .
The price of meat dropped .
If I were you , I wouldn't hesitate .
Tom and John are brothers-in-law .
I wouldn't be surprised if it rained .
I don't bite .
Monday will likely be a cold day .
I have absolutely no problem with that .
To tell you the truth , I'm not sure what I should be doing .
I'm in the middle of something . Can I call you back ?
We know who the terrorists are .
I think we're almost there .
I expected somebody to be there .
Tom is going to get married next month .
Tom told me you're famous .
Don't you think you can help Tom with that ?
The window is still broken .
Tom has learned a lot about Australia from me .
Don't you want something to do ?
Can you let the dog in ?
They screamed .
You can't ride a horse .
I know that Tom is optimistic .
Why do you love me ?
"Where do you live" ? "I live in Tokyo" .
I told Tom all about what happened .
To be successful , you need to look like you're already successful .
She handed him a book .
You know that Tom doesn't like that .
I have three cats .
If you drink , don't drive . If you drive , don't drink .
It's a great company to work for .
I didn't need to do that .
Tom is already married .
You arrived too early .
Tell the maid to make the beds .
The two smiled .
The child dragged a chair over to the bench so it could reach the biscuit tin .
I can't eat another bite .
I'd better help Tom out .
Where's my money ?
Fasten your seat belts .
Tom was playing with Mary's dog .
Tom did what he thought was right .
May I ask you some questions about your name ?
Tom got drunk .
Some people started dancing .
Am I going to die ?
My uncle gave me a camera .
Who do you like ?
How did you like the party ?
Tom tried to run away .
It's a miracle I'm still alive .
It's free .
Do you think Tom would give us this ?
I'll let you pay for it .
I knew that you wanted to do that .
I like writing .
It was an excellent game .
We were there last night .
Welcome to Boston .
It won't last forever .
That drum has a very strange sound .
Tom has never seen Mary dance .
You should know that I'm in love with Mary .
I'm trying to quit smoking .
Did you guys sing ?
Are you going on foot ?
I'd like to come and see you .
Tom was my student .
I've already corrected that .
I saw Tom's name on the cover .
The post office is down the street . You can't miss it .
They went out .
Tom said that he was afraid of heights .
Would it be OK if I came to the ceremony ?
I have to be there at 2:30 .
They moved ahead slowly .
Tom scored a goal .
We really thank you for your patronage .
Are you listening to me ?
If you finish your homework , you can watch TV .
Tom seems to be honest .
Tom shouldn't have told Mary what John did .
Tom is always telling Mary that he loves her .
I don't think that she will come .
They're my classmates .
Tom isn't sleeping .
Tom reads a lot of books .
The worst is over .
He's very good at playing baseball .
I'm going to change my shirt .
I fixed it .
We loved you .
I can't go with you tomorrow .
We'll decide .
I saw something that seemed odd to me .
I knew we were going to get married the moment I met you .
This place isn't safe anymore .
The problem is that I don't have enough money .
We're powerful .
Come here and join us .
I didn't know that Tom had a brother .
Tom doesn't want to spend any more time in Boston .
I'm proud of myself .
Do you know us ?
It's a lovely day .
Tom is saving his money up to start a business .
Our teacher permitted us to use a dictionary during the test .
I'm very happy .
He ran into debt .
Don't you want to go with me ?
Why did you buy flowers ?
There's nothing more painful than losing one's child .
It's an old piano .
You said that you needed more time .
I'd like to change my room .
We went to high school together .
You didn't read the contract carefully , did you ?
Some people like it .
May I use this telephone ?
I was able to find the street , but I couldn't find her house .
Could you hold this picture straight for a while ?
What period is this painting from ?
I think it's time for me to get a bit of exercise .
How's your sister ?
When was the last time you ate pizza ?
We don't have time to hesitate .
I've come to pick up Tom .
Chinese food is no less delicious than French .
This is free .
Can I help you with anything ?
Is that table dirty ?
This is a bit scary .
If it rains tomorrow , they will not go .
There are no wrong answers .
"Are you tired" ? "No , not at all" .
Are you coming with me ?
Tom was a prison warden for three years .
What do you do here , Tom ?
I'm the only one who understands you .
We'll discuss that when the time comes .
It was foolish of you to accept his offer .
Who's that sitting next to you in this picture ?
Tom is sitting on a chair .
It may already be too late for him .
This isn't going to work .
Look around .
Our class has increased in size .
They rented a house .
How strange !
I want you to love me .
Where can I buy one of those ?
Do you have paper ?
I've already decided not to do that .
He went back to Japan .
We didn't know how dangerous doing that was going to be .
I told Tom that was a good idea .
What's the Wi-Fi password ?
His house is not far from here .
I love that song .
What page are you on ?
Is there anything else we can do for you ?
My heart wasn't in the work .
What time did Tom come home ?
I am older than your brother .
He was in critical condition .
Tom doesn't pay us . Somebody else does .
The flower shop is opposite the park .
It seemed that he had been very happy .
Tom is the one who told me your phone number .
I drew a picture of a spaceship .
I was happy , wasn't I ?
May I borrow it ?
Tom doesn't think anybody else wants to come .
I'm considering studying in the United States next year .
I know it wasn't easy .
I practice the piano when I'm bored .
After reading Tom's letter , Mary started crying .
Why don't we ask for Tom's advice ?
The drummer is also the lead singer of that band .
Tom says he wants to learn French .
October twentieth was Tom's birthday .
Women tend to put more pictures on social networks than men .
We've run out of kerosene .
"When did you return" ? "I came back the day before yesterday" .
If you hurry up , you will be in time .
I didn't hear Tom enter the room .
Glass breaks easily .
Tom's guardian angel must've been watching over him .
Where is the end of this line ?
I didn't think Tom was asleep .
I want you to promise me that you'll do that .
I was making a cake .
Tom left the house shortly after Mary left .
Tom is irresponsible , isn't he ?
Did you really visit Boston ?
I bought a house in Boston .
I'm here to fix the broken window .
We're all Canadians here .
I think Tom is having a good time .
Tom doesn't want to talk to you .
Why did this occur ?
I have to pick him up from the station .
Everyone laughed at Tom .
I'll be in Boston for three days .
I think you're bluffing .
I don't know where I am exactly .
I had my room cleaned .
Tom shut the drawer .
Tom said he was sorry for last night .
Many scientists knew him .
The radio is too loud .
That's terrible .
That's all I do .
There are a lot of people who want to talk to Tom .
We aren't sure what to do .
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer .
Can you read ?
Tom asked Mary to go to the store to buy some bread .
Tom was a diplomat .
The bus will arrive within ten minutes .
It's OK .
Keep Tom quiet .
He began to look for work .
Is that car yours ?
We're coming .
I'll pay for dinner .
How could you allow it ?
Where did I put my car keys ?
Tom has never played guitar with Mary .
Are you feeling all right today ?
Tom didn't look upset .
We're worried about you .
Tom told Mary to clean her room .
When are you going to the library ?
My fate is in your hands .
Does this train have a sleeping car ?
Is there anything else I can do ?
I had to beg Tom to ask Mary out on a date .
I invited Tom to our party .
The last thing I want to do is make Tom sad .
Mary used her smartphone as a mirror to touch-up her makeup .
It's time to go to school .
How many wives have you had ?
What will you do ?
I can't tell you about it yet .
Who made it ?
Tom ended up doing that last night .
I will stay at home .
Tom touched the hot stove and burned his hand .
Tom didn't miss anything .
Be punctual .
These new cars are on sale .
What Tom really wanted to eat was chocolate pudding .
Just tell me where it is .
I can give you something for your pain .
Does Tom believe in miracles ?
I don't like any of the songs that Tom sings .
Why should I listen to you ?
The woman over there holding a baby is my wife .
I need one more .
The water was hot .
Let me put it in another way .
I wanted to sleep on it .
We recognized Tom .
Were you thinking about me ?
Tom loves cooking .
I got three presents for my birthday .
Mr . Jackson might be our teacher next year .
It's very hot here in the summer .
I rarely eat meat .
You must be crazy .
I think your answer is correct .
My mother left home ten minutes ago .
He picked up a stone .
Tom knows where it is .
You've been busy , haven't you ?
We used to work together .
Aren't you tired of me yet ?
Tom couldn't figure out how Mary managed to stay alive .
Everybody started to panic .
What was I afraid of ?
We have all the information we need .
Please knock before you come in .
Are you sure that's what you saw ?
What are you doing ?
I'm having fun .
The wound on my leg is healing .
Why is Tom wearing a name tag ?
What woke you up ?
Is Tom really Canadian ?
There's a hair in my soup .
Let's follow his advice .
He loves coffee .
Take as many as you want .
Tom didn't want me to phone Mary .
I think you should leave now .
Make a sketch of your house .
It's a good book .
What color are your bedroom walls ?
Here is your bag .
I respect your views .
I want this television .
How long has it been since you received a letter from him ?
Tom has been yakking on the phone for hours .
You must clean your room .
Have you found what you were looking for ?
She has a kind heart .
What was the name of the last song that you sang ?
It must've been quick .
If it rains tomorrow , we won't go .
I'd like to see that .
Tom likes to pretend that he has a lot of money .
What are you going to have ?
I live very close to the subway station .
Did you go to the beach alone ?
Now that you are grown-up , it is up to you to decide what to do .
Four multiplied by two is eight .
Tom still hasn't come back .
Tom fell in love with his next door neighbor .
They said storage costs were too high .
"What's your wife's name" ? "I'm not married" .
Tom takes a shower every day .
Everybody arrived on time .
Tom stood in front of Mary .
Tom isn't very clever .
Tom doesn't know how much the ticket will cost .
We promised .
In December 1989 , he sent troops to Panama .
Rome was not built in a day .
I suspect that Tom and Mary are alone .
I think it's best if you tell Tom .
I want a green one .
Tom needs to take his medication .
I have no money to pay for the bus .
Where is it ?
Tom isn't going to come home .
I have some other appointments .
Mary likes milk very much .
What time did you wake up ?
The only problem is Tom didn't finish his exam .
I almost choked .
Tom laughed so hard he almost choked .
The pleasure's all mine .
How do you like my house ?
There was little sugar left in the pot .
Could you lend me thirty dollars ?
Hurry up .
Tom walked around the store .
Tom couldn't do anything for Mary .
Tom doesn't have to come to school tomorrow .
I've tried everything .
I received a letter from my brother .
Have you made up your mind about what you're going to give Tom for his birthday ?
Tom broke a window .
Tom seemed to be feeling fine .
Tom said he wasn't going to help us .
I'll accompany you to the hospital .
Don't be surprised if Tom does that .
They invited me to dinner .
Tom wanted to talk with Mary .
They're going to kill me .
The people were screaming .
This is one of the worst movies that I've ever seen .
A prolonged silence followed .
There's nothing else in the box .
The old man was accompanied by his grandchild .
I feared the worst .
I do the laundry on Sundays .
He denied everything .
If only I'd left home five minutes earlier , I would've gotten to the train station in time .
Where will we eat ?
Tom knew something was off .
Did your husband foot the bill ?
I went to sleep during the lesson .
This wine tastes good .
How can I make a telephone call to Japan ?
Tom raised his children by himself .
Don't you know what this is ?
Tom knows nothing about Boston .
Where do you think you're going ?
We have to figure out a way to encourage Tom to do the right thing .
Tom realized he didn't have enough money to buy everything he needed .
Tom won't visit Mary on Monday .
Tom wouldn't drive a car like this .
We need to do that before Tom gets here .
Tom started screaming again .
Everyone wants to meet you . You're famous !
Tom and Mary went to the beach by bicycle .
Please forgive me for telling a lie .
Tom doesn't speak French , but his parents do .
What was the name of the last song you sang ?
I plan to live in the city .
How much rent do you pay ?
You might want to bring Tom with you .
I missed you .
Tom is not available .
How many times have you been burgled ?
I prefer riding to walking .
Tom said Mary is afraid .
Tom started crying uncontrollably .
There are no chairs in this room .
They say that Tom didn't do that .
Tom turned on the radio .
I'm helping you .
That sounds very tempting .
Today , I don't feel like doing anything .
I really enjoy surfing .
Never drive faster than your guardian angel can fly .
Tom didn't need help doing that .
I honestly didn't think that Tom would be here .
Tom was standing in the middle of the road .
Which wine goes best with red meat ?
Tom and Mary didn't know each other .
Tom is three years older than you , isn't he ?
He behaves very naturally .
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't include her phone number in her profile .
Close your eyes .
His brother is more patient than he is .
Is Tom still on vacation ?
Somebody made a mistake .
Tom is efficient .
Tom didn't have an umbrella , so I lent him mine .
I'm quite sure .
Tom thought that I was you .
Am I talking too fast ?
You were scared , weren't you ?
You have three cats .
That dictionary is mine .
Tom turned on the car radio .
You like it , don't you ?
Where I come from , people don't do things like that .
There's no escape .
They lost their way in the mountain .
It was urgent .
You don't have to come if you don't want to .
Do you know his brother ?
Tom stabbed Mary with a kitchen knife .
You've made a terrible mistake .
Wait in line , please .
Should Tom be worried ?
Tom is the captain of the soccer team .
Would you like to learn French ?
Why should I do that ?
Are you bored ?
How do you do it ?
I sat under a tree and read the newspaper .
We're wasting precious time .
We are both in the same class .
It had snowed .
Am I allowed to use this ?
I think that that's very important .
I will follow you wherever you go .
He got used to the work .
Tom scared Mary .
They'll fail .
Don't blow your nose like that .
Tom isn't as old as I am .
Our conversation was interrupted by his sneezes .
Tom has a lot of Canadian friends .
Would you tell me why you want Tom to do that ?
That'd be murder .
Are you trying to scare me ?
You can lean on me .
You don't fool me .
I know Tom knows I had to do that .
There are four seasons in a year .
I got a C in English .
I don't know why you're laughing .
Please wash it .
You've just answered your own question .
I figured out how to do that on my own .
I heard someone call my name .
Are you going somewhere with this ?
Tom sells T-shirts at a 30 percent discount .
They're quiet .
Are you absolutely sure it was Tom you saw doing that ?
I'm taller than Tom is .
Don't count on that happening .
Have you ever played Truth or Dare before ?
Tom knew about all that .
Tom asked Mary to walk a little slower .
Birds flap their wings to fly .
I still think that's the most plausible reason .
I'm yours .
Who are we waiting for ?
I think that Tom is strong .
How's Tom doing in Australia ?
It's 2:30 now .
It's Tom's only chance .
Tom isn't doing that the right way .
Can you swim ?
I don't feel like drinking vodka .
I want to live in Australia .
They were not pleased .
I'm still trying to figure out what Tom was trying to tell me .
Do you think yours is better ?
We're back from Australia .
I'm trying .
Can we speak in French ?
You should've called the cops .
Tom didn't need more time .
He really ticked me off .
Tom sat down and wrote a letter .
I made this dress myself .
We split the bill .
Tom got sick and couldn't go .
They always wake up early , even on Sundays .
I don't understand the meaning of this phrase .
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation .
You're twice as strong as me .
It won't open .
How much time do you spend each week studying French ?
I no longer need them .
How much is everything ?
Tom hung up his coat .
I urge everyone to do the same .
I try to stay informed .
What has become of the book I put here a few minutes ago ?
Can you speak a little slower ?
I can see you're working .
I was attacked in broad daylight .
Don't get angry with Tom .
Put out the light .
Tom is in a meeting , but Mary's in her office .
Why did you come so early ?
Tom said he couldn't remember anything .
If I find your passport , I'll call you .
They both lived in Boston .
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there ?
He resigned .
Tom and I have different priorities .
You probably don't remember me .
Can I have some water ?
How did Tom react to the news ?
Will you swim with Tom ?
Tom shoved Mary off the diving board .
It's impossible to fix .
When was the last time Tom came to Boston ?
We'll wait here .
Tom burned the cake .
The store's closed .
Where are you going this afternoon ?
That's not the way Grandma made stuffing .
My eyes are tired .
The price includes tax .
Shall we start ?
We won't leave until Monday evening .
I knew what was in the other room .
Mercury has a very thin atmosphere .
I have a green shirt .
I wasn't the one who broke the window .
I often go skiing in the winter .
Our rent is too expensive , so we're looking for another apartment .
Tell Tom what the problem was .
Do I have to decide right now ?
Thank you in advance for your help .
Tom is a good person .
Nice to talk to you .
I know you're still angry with me .
I am a vegetarian .
You'll have to pay .
That is mine . I don't know where hers is .
I'm going to sleep now .
I'm trying to calm Tom down .
I think that I can do that again .
You have no proof .
I nearly starved .
I want these .
It isn't an easy subject to talk about .
The boys were quiet .
What time do you get up on workdays ?
Isn't that him sitting on a bench ?
Bring your student ID .
How much have your lives changed ?
Tom's last name is unknown .
My name isn't Tom anymore .
We work about eight hours a day .
I want you to tell me what you really think of me .
The car is ready .
All I have is books .
I'm not going to do anything about it .
I can't be fired .
We live in a very complicated world .
The boy who lives next door helped me paint the fence .
The judge laughed in spite of himself .
Tom laid the newspaper on the table .
Maybe Tom's car broke down .
Everybody yells at me .
No one cried .
It's a quote from the book .
I don't know many people in Boston .
Tom doesn't have enough friends .
I'd never seen a raccoon before .
I got married 8 years ago .
Tom wanted to help Mary rake the leaves , but she was using the only rake .
Be nice .
How long does a butterfly live ?
Luck's on my side today .
Tom was sitting alone in his room .
We should do something about that today .
I thought it was a bit much .
We understand that completely .
I hope Tom understands .
I've lost my sense of smell .
It'll just take a second .
Do you want to go with us ?
It's hard to get rid of bad habits .
Is that fair to you ?
Mary went to the beauty salon .
She called up her mother on the phone .
What do you like about it ?
I hope no one saw you come in here .
Tom wants to get married again .
The captain of the ship decided to change course .
Have you finished breakfast yet ?
I can see that .
I want to sing with you .
I only have eyes for you .
Have you checked under the couch ?
That's all that I can tell you .
What's the horse's name ?
I wonder what Tom is going to do .
Tom doesn't understand how this works .
What are we going to do if that happens ?
The king crushed his enemies .
It's locked .
I'm taking them with me .
My knee is bleeding .
That's not exactly an accurate comparison .
I won first prize .
Tom is wrapping Mary's present now .
Tom brought a cup of tea to me .
Thanks for the compliment .
Did Tom bribe Mary ?
Tom says he doesn't need money .
This coat doesn't fit me .
There is one big difference .
Does Tom know we're here ?
My friends are waiting for me inside .
He lived an unhappy life .
Tom became a teacher .
Whose house is that ?
What if he's wrong ?
When he was a child , he went to Paris three times .
I've found a place to live .
Why don't you just quit your job ?
Tom winced with pain .
I'd like to see the Statue of Liberty .
I was eating dinner then .
I'm unmarried .
He doesn't want it .
Tom washed his socks in the sink .
When do you eat breakfast ?
Tom seemed oblivious .
Tom reached under his seat .
We all die .
All the guys were laughing .
I come to Boston about once a month .
I'll never forget your kindness .
Fantastic !
Tom confused us .
I was just joking .
Tom will pay for that .
I sometimes watch TV .
We took a taxi so we wouldn't be late .
Do you know where we are ?
You're not afraid of me , are you ?
Do you speak my language ?
Tom spent years living on the streets of Boston .
I'll make a note of that .
My job is taking care of the baby .
You are a patient man .
If Tom ate more vegetables , he'd probably be healthier .
Don't try to make me angry .
Are you brushing your teeth properly ?
I just want to be certain that it's OK .
They must be brothers .
It won't take so long .
Today's paper says that another typhoon is on its way .
I'll sign it tomorrow .
It isn't an easy subject to write about .
I don't take drugs .
Tom sat next to Mary .
I don't study as much as I should .
They made me go there .
I realize it's hard to believe .
My client isn't saying another word .
Tom told Mary that he was busy .
He can speak Japanese .
Look closer .
I knew you wouldn't like the way Tom did that .
Tom liked horses .
Everybody was tired .
The Japanese have dark eyes .
The money you have is more important than the money you had .
Tom smelled a rat .
We're still discussing that matter .
We're sad .
They won't know we're there .
The parents are playing a game with their children .
Most writers hate being criticized .
The water is hot .
I'd like to send these to Japan .
The amount of paper produced by a country is closely related to its cultural standards .
Was your father right ?
We need to keep our cities clean .
Can't we break it ?
I have no more ideas .
I thought Tom was your cousin .
I have no food .
Please take a look at this picture .
What language do you use when you talk with your parents ?
Does Tom still like Indian food ?
Which is your pen ?
She is an appalling cook .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Are you sure this is Tom's room ?
I know you love me , but all I feel for you is just affection .
They fight constantly .
She achieved her goal .
Tom admitted that he wasn't prepared .
Her bike is blue .
You have no idea what it feels like .
How do you know I'm not Canadian ?
Make sure you haven't forgotten anybody .
Isn't one of you enough ?
Let's stop wasting time .
Tom's dog was run over by a car .
Tom deceived Mary .
I'd rather stay here in Boston .
That's how Tom makes his living .
I've already fed the dog .
I've already spoken with Tom .
Don't stop him .
Tom was the last one to show up .
I don't want to do it like that .
What's Tom look like ?
I wanted to talk to you about something .
The members of the jury listened carefully to the attorney .
Tom is absent because he has a cold .
I'm trying to remember Tom's face , but I can't .
Hold me closer , Tom .
She can do both at the same time .
There isn't any milk left .
What did they do ?
Tell Tom what you'll do .
What did Tom borrow from you ?
Today my son turns four years old .
Don't worry . It won't take very long .
Does Tom have children ?
I lent my umbrella to Tom .
I have dandruff .
I don't want your help .
Look who's there .
I can handle the situation .
She never thought her dreams would come true .
I thought Tom might be the one responsible for the problem .
Lemon tea without sugar , please .
I was so unhappy .
Tom only shaves once a week .
Tom dug through his pockets looking for money .
Tom knows who won .
Don't buy it .
I worked in this company for three decades .
Take your meds .
She left her children behind .
She was very busy .
When did you go to Boston with Tom ?
Tell Tom the problem is solved .
Do you think that Tom will help us ?
I'm not as rich as Tom .
Tom has been living in Boston since 2013 .
I like the view .
Don't tell me Tom finally said yes .
I know you're going to learn a lot .
When the thief heard the dog bark , he ran away .
You're up to something .
He attended the party yesterday .
Tom doesn't like to be outside .
I don't see Tom going anywhere .
You seem sad .
There's a problem .
You did your part .
I don't really want to go swimming with you .
Why are you all still awake ?
The Japanese take their shoes off before entering their homes .
Their wedding will be tomorrow .
You're lost .
I'm getting tired of your complaints .
Don't do that , OK ?
I didn't know that Tom had a girlfriend .
I'm not sure that that's what Tom needs .
Can you explain it briefly ?
I'm the one who has the key .
Tom is playing poker with his friends .
It's just started raining .
I talked to her .
I like to eat out .
I didn't know that Tom was capable of doing that .
Tom is still a policeman .
I want to speak to my lawyer .
The bus is still half full .
Are you Tom's girlfriend ?
I need some time .
I was deeply ashamed .
The cancer had spread to several organs .
She has a good figure .
I'll return it to you right away .
It can be done in a day .
I think married people have more problems than single people .
She looked sadly at me .
You told her that you had finished the work three days ago .
Please call an ambulance .
Tom has to be more careful .
I don't want to say anything .
Listen .
We need to maintain focus .
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me .
Tom counted the money twice .
Tom will find you .
I know what you've done .
Earthquakes destroy buildings .
This is definitely not what I had in mind .
Two heads are better than one .
Do you want us to kill Tom ?
Tom was able to get into the house through a window .
Turn the radio down .
Tom and Mary are still here .
Take a whiff .
I think that Tom is impolite .
I work in marketing .
I think Tom is in love .
I am his friend and will remain so .
You should call a doctor right away .
This is my life .
How did you actually find that ?
You're not having much luck , are you ?
You're stronger than Tom .
Everyone had fun .
Tom knew how to do that already , so I didn't have to show him .
Tom perjured himself .
I wonder if this is love .
I know you're frustrated .
Tom had to admit that Mary was right .
Why are you so late ?
I'm not the one who takes out the garbage .
I have to change the batteries in the radio .
Tom is my ally .
Tom's room is ready .
Do you want to stay ?
It's only a slight cold .
I made other plans .
Her eyes were filled with tears .
Everyone's there .
They have come .
Tom doesn't think that we should even consider doing that .
Tom opened the door and the dog ran out .
Tom and Mary argued a lot .
Everyone wins .
Tom went over there .
I prefer to work on my own .
Don't you like my cooking ?
I'm too young to drive a car .
You should join us .
Tom has gone missing .
I know who I'd recommend for the job .
Did you sleep here ?
The concert is about to start .
I buy things I know that I'm not going to use .
My parents and I drove all night .
This is difficult to believe .
Pleased to meet you .
It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice .
Tom is reading a gardening manual .
She likes jazz , and so do I .
Where do you live , Tom ?
They're lying .
I love my dad .
That's how it all began .
Are you going to spend all of this money ?
I feel blessed .
Tom wants Mary to go to Boston with him .
Was that all you said to Tom ?
Tom was fluent in French .
I expect your help .
Today is Monday .
Listen , I really can't talk right now .
Tom doesn't want to play .
I shouldn't have left you alone .
There's something going on here .
Will you come or not ?
Let us tell you why we came .
Tom was happy about that .
Tom still doesn't speak French very well .
We've written to them .
We're three hours from Boston .
The game was probably canceled .
It's mean to do that .
I don't want one .
Don't worry . I'll take care of you .
They're preparing for another attack .
The plan is subject to his approval .
We need to have a talk , Tom .
I had no intention of doing so .
Please phone Tom .
I'll be counting on you to bring the drinks .
You give me so much .
Have you ever had a serious illness ?
I'll visit soon .
Can you speak English ?
They relaxed on the beach .
Who do you think you're talking to ?
I have to go now .
Tom told me where you hid the gold coins .
My grandfather turned 89 years old .
We have absolutely nothing in common .
I think Tom is drunk .
I was being eaten alive by mosquitos .
He traveled on business .
He hid behind the tree .
I hope they agree .
I found the keys .
His name was Tom .
Tom eventually left Boston .
She's way out of my league .
Tom says he heard Mary yawning .
Is your husband also from Boston ?
Let's come back .
Let's visit Tom .
Tom followed in his father's footsteps .
I had a strange dream .
Who do you want to win ?
I don't know whether I can go or not .
Tom can drive a car .
Tom has a white dog .
Where do you live ?
We've already spent too much time doing this .
How do you do ?
I would really like to study French .
I didn't feel a thing .
He was driving a car along the street .
The truck collided with the bus .
I have a dentist appointment on Monday .
You've won .
White bread , please .
Tom doesn't really have much choice .
If you can't have children , you could always adopt .
He has four mobile phones .
Tom said yes .
Why would you want to hurt Tom ?
That seems simple enough .
Come forward .
Why are you always so busy ?
Don't be so mean .
What happened ? You look pale .
Tom used his head .
Tom bought a Japanese-Chinese dictionary .
Stop stalling and do what I told you .
I was scared , too .
I was impressed by Tom's honesty .
Tom took something that didn't belong to him .
Good movies expand our horizons .
Tom doesn't realize how smart Mary is .
I'm taking a walk in a park .
Tom's not a bad kid .
Tell Tom I'm joking .
I hope Tom is all right .
They asked him .
Tom is trying to learn a few card tricks .
I never was very good at math .
We took the quickest route .
I don't understand why people do that .
I don't want to remain here .
Tom is still married , isn't he ?
I'm the captain of this ship .
I think that I'll enjoy doing that .
Women loved it .
A girl drowned in the pond yesterday .
I'll be there in a minute .
How does this disease spread ?
Tom shaves three times a week .
I say it's OK .
I have only myself to blame .
My life is like a test that I haven't studied for .
I met a friend at the airport .
It's a sad story .
I think that I soon will go to sleep .
He was not born blind .
Tom and I are going swimming tomorrow morning .
I feel guilty about it .
Do you know his father ?
What do you think is going on ?
Who did you meet ?
I have great friends .
I've never been so humiliated .
We learned how to read French .
We saw a castle in the distance .
You are in my way .
I wish I could do that myself .
That's my seat .
I think that that was very special .
I think that Tom and Mary are related .
I was having lunch .
I commute to work by bicycle .
What you just said isn't relevant .
Where's your car ?
Tom didn't like Boston very much .
To tell you the truth , I don't like him .
There are other options .
May we go now ?
Australia is a beautiful country .
Aren't you sleepy ?
How can I ever forget Tom ?
We're not hiring right now .
Tom wondered why Mary wasn't happy .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Tom said that he didn't know French .
It snowed last night .
Where's Tom been all day ?
I wanted to buy the book , but I found I had no more than 200 yen with me .
We need your help .
I've been paying attention .
Neither Tom nor Mary has to go anywhere today .
Tom will probably not do that today .
I thought he wouldn't recognize her .
I want to spend the whole summer in Boston .
We were glad we had each other .
I think he is honest .
We're sorry we weren't able to help you .
You've got to take care of yourself .
I'll never give up .
Traveling is a lot of fun .
I think I forgot to tell Tom that .
Tom isn't very good at it .
I want to drink coffee .
How much is that mountain bike ?
Tom certainly seems to have a sense of humor .
Tom and Mary have been arrested .
I love you more deeply than I can say .
I'm still not sure why .
Tom put the envelope on the table .
You're not stupid .
I'm worried about the baby .
Will you go to school tomorrow ?
What were you hoping to find ?
I don't want to do any of those things .
It's not something that I want to do .
Tom said that he wasn't afraid .
We arrived at the airport three hours before our flight .
Stop !
Tom and Mary had three children .
Don't write in red ink .
Tom hid his worries from his wife .
Tom's greedy .
I do some work for Tom from time to time .
Would you please turn down the TV ?
Is there snow on top of the mountain ?
Tom will dance .
Well , what shall we do ?
A person who is addicted to work is called a workaholic .
Retrace your steps and maybe you'll find your keys .
I'm not proud of this .
The challenges are enormous .
Leave Tom .
Look at this stuff .
Why are you asking ?
Tom just wants to help you .
When I painted this picture , I was 23 years old .
There are no towels in room 15 .
Why don't you grab yourself something to drink out of the fridge ?
Will you travel alone ?
The water was cold .
I want to do this .
Are you and Tom still dating ?
I already feel better .
Tom didn't write back to Mary .
The couple had a son .
I see Tom .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn't get into trouble .
Is that Tom's bedroom ?
I estimate that the work will cost more than $10 , 000 .
Tom hasn't dropped out of the race .
Something drastic needs to happen .
Why weren't you paying attention to what the teacher was saying ?
The cops are here .
It suits me .
Hello , may I speak to Tom ?
I am sure of winning the tennis match .
We've got nothing in common .
Tom doesn't smoke weed .
"Will the project be completed on time" ? "I can guarantee it" .
You seem very nervous .
We need to burn all these leaves .
This is the book that you're looking for .
They're playing cards .
She studies English every day .
Turn the kitchen light off , please .
I have to get home before 2:30 .
Please take this medicine .
Let's play some football .
Did you really plan this all yourself ?
Tom left a note .
Bring your student ID .
It's quite different .
Tom didn't want to invite Mary to the party .
What did you think Tom would do ?
Tom is sensitive .
She couldn't have said that .
I sleep on my side .
I don't like costume parties .
Tom got tired of waiting for Mary , so he left without her .
Shut up ! You're talking too much .
Can you read ?
Who are you ?
This car needs washed .
You know that once you're inside , you'll never be able to get out .
Tom is going to find us .
History is replete with the stories of unappreciated genius .
Tom finally gave up smoking .
I want to give up .
Give me the ball .
You're quite smart .
I hear that you married a rich man .
I realize that there's a problem .
Therefore , it is necessary to reduce the cost .
If for some reason I don't make it , go alone .
How long do you think it would take you to paint my house ?
I've changed departments .
Who's dying ?
Don't you want to do that with Tom again ?
I'll finish this later .
I'm worried about Tom's health .
Don't worry . I won't tell Tom .
It is by no means easy to master a foreign language .
I always do that wrong .
You're avoiding me , aren't you ?
What's the weather like this morning ?
I saw Tom get off the bus .
Tom blinked his eyes .
Go to the hospital .
Some people believe in ghosts .
Welcome to the family .
The concert is over .
The cup broke .
Will Tom do anything about it ?
I'm sorry for dragging you into this .
He gave up .
I think you need to tell Tom how you feel .
The participants were for the most part women .
We were Tom's mentors .
Welcome to our home .
I forgot to wear a belt .
Look at that mountain .
Tom is crying again .
What are they after ?
There is a church near my house .

About this time tomorrow , we'll be climbing Mt . Fuji .

My girlfriend is an actress .
Tom and I'll miss Mary .
Somebody called .
I'll be back at six-thirty .
Tom is rich enough to do just about anything he wants to do .
You ruined everything .
Please remind me to phone him tomorrow .
Do you understand me ?
We'll scream .
Is Tom partly to blame ?
I like to take a hot bath every night before bed .
Nobody cares for me .
Sometimes I feel like living a more peaceful life .
Join us .
Mix three eggs and a cup of sugar .
We kissed each other .
Have you seen this man ?
I don't want to make the same mistakes over again .
Tell me something I don't already know .
I can't put up with Tom .
Don't you want to go to school ?
Would you like me to help you with your homework ?
I know that we can help each other .
Tom thought it was a bomb .
Our apartment is on the third floor .
We can't go back out there .
You did it again .
Keep away .
She wouldn't give him a gift .
I think it's better for Tom to stay here .
I'm never late .
That door won't open .
I retired three years ago .
Your help is vital to the success of our plan .
The sky was gray .
Hey , you ! What are you doing ?
Tom wasn't sleepy , and I wasn't , either .
Which one of you arrived first ?
Mom , when's supper ?
Tom is doing fine .
Tom says he's not tired .
Visitors may not feed the animals .
Do what you consider necessary .
Please make yourself comfortable .

I appreciate your family .
Isn't this against the rules ?
You're old .
I was happy there .
We'll never forget your kindness .
A lot can happen in three hours .
She doesn't know how to play golf .
I've already told you that several times .
You two stay here .
We found a great restaurant on Park Street .
I've got nothing to say to him .
Tom ate part of the ham , and then put the rest into the refrigerator .
There's a house behind the trees .
Are you threatening me ?
She can't live without him .
Sport knows no borders .
Tom saw a doctor .
This is the best seafood restaurant in the neighborhood .
I have to water the flowers .
Tom told me that he wanted to win .
Tom asked Mary why she was late .
Be quiet . Don't talk in the theater .
Tom is buying us a round of drinks .
Do you want to get fat ?
Tom and Mary live near the library .
I don't like talking about my family .
Four multiplied by two is eight .
How old is your grandson ?
Tell me what really happened .
I have cash .
Tom came out of his hiding place .
Tom has an iPhone .
Call my husband .
I'm very nervous .
I want to eat something good .
Are you sure you don't want anything ?
Tom didn't buy Mary anything .
We'd like to ask you a few questions .
I don't have any Canadian friends .
No one can achieve anything without effort .
I've never seen Tom wear a hat .
I made up for lost time .
Tom has been sleeping on the couch .
I can't believe Tom did that .
They bought a car .
He asked his teacher stupid questions .
You are very kind to show me the way .
I would like to see you before I leave .
Tom is one of the nicest people I know .
Don't laugh at him for making a mistake .
Tom gave Mary CPR .
Even though the weather was bad , I decided to go out .
See you !
Is Tom also studying French ?
We know why .
As the saying goes , "Nothing ventured , nothing gained" .
Tom is a pretty good French teacher .
What are you selling ?
What are you reading ?
I don't think I'm biased .
Let's have lunch here .
Tom told me he'd be here at about 2:30 .
I still haven't paid last month's rent .
I'm looking for some regular work .
I have no time to read .
How many foreign languages can you speak ?
I like your T-shirt .
That would be interesting .
Is there something else you can do for Tom ?
I'll be back at half past six .
I've never noticed that before .
It's just your imagination .
Tom forgot to pay his rent .
Tom is the person who does that .
I get phone calls every day from Tom .
I'm afraid you've misunderstood me .
You're bright .
I wonder how Tom got away .
We're all Canadians .
I can't tell you what we ended up doing .
I left my wallet at home on that particular day .
Tom handed the envelope full of cash to Mary .
He will learn the facts in the course of time .
You're scaring the kids .
I'm sure Tom misses Mary .
I really liked what you cooked for me .
Marriages are made in heaven .
Tom mistreated Mary .
It's a cheap restaurant .
They play in the afternoon .
I should have told you before .

Can I open the window ?

Speaking French is easy for me .
I boiled an egg .
Tom suggested we do it tomorrow .
Mary is beautiful .
Where's the compass ?
I was running .
I love studying languages .
My mother is sick with a bad cold .
What are they asking you to do ?
I think they know us .
May I pay by check ?
Tom just wants to be left alone .
Manga are to the Japanese film industry what bestsellers are to Hollywood .
I did well .
I'll be here till next Monday .
You can't ask me to do this .
Have you still not finished paying for my bike ?
Several apples fell from the tree .
I really think that you shouldn't do that .
I wasn't busy yesterday .
I didn't think you'd be interested .
How did Tom know we were coming ?
Tom is going to sit here , isn't he ?
I'll teach you .
I'd like to send this package to Japan .
They felt their candidate would win in 1860 .
I didn't care for that .
I'm very busy today .
Tom has gotten married .
Do you have a subway map ?
I did speak , but no one listened to me .
Tom likes to read English subtitles while watching movies in English .
What's your favorite drink ?
I'm proud of you .
What did you get me ?
All your questions will be answered .
He explained in detail what he had seen .
Has anyone tried this before ?
That's a pathetic excuse .
We'll be fine .
Thank you for coming to see me .
Tom tried to talk to us in French .
They are my friends .
My mom doesn't speak English very well .
I'm still taller than Tom .
I think that that's up to you now .
Do you have professional experience ?
Did you know Tom had a twin brother ?
Why would Tom do that to us ?
Tom has only known Mary for a few weeks .
My father has never been abroad .
We ate way too much last night .
We live in Boston .
How many employees do you have ?
Boston is my favorite city .
That dictionary is mine .
I like watching movies .
I arrived too early .
What a bizarre story !
We have achieved all our aims .
We loved Tom .
It's very cold today , don't you think ?
I won't say much .
I tried to talk to the waiter in French .
I forgot to give you my phone number .
I know that Tom is awake .
I hope you don't think I'm as obnoxious as Tom is .
His name's Tom .
Are you really ready to help ?
I would like to see it .
I was really young when I met you .
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter .
That sounds incredible .
Do they sell tangerines ?
He attempted to escape .
I'd just like to eat my breakfast in peace .
Tom isn't funny .
What's the most delicious fruit in Japan ?
Tom is suffering .
Tom crammed everything into his suitcase .
Keep quiet . The baby is sleeping .
Tom likes coffee without sugar .
Tom wasn't here when I got home .
Perhaps you're right .
That's blackmail .
We tried everything .
How is your father ?
Time is our generation's worst enemy .
I haven't learned much yet .
The cat is sitting on the chair and looking at the meat that's lying on the kitchen table .
I want to hear all about your trip .
Thanks for helping .
That's all I really need .
We study French at school .
We want to have a baby .
You seemed to like that .
She was brought up by him .
May I ask you a favor ?
He might change his mind .
It's been three years since Tom came to Australia .
I almost cried .
I saw the dog .
There's nothing in the trunk .
I wouldn't do that if I were you .
Does Tom have a younger brother ?
How old is Tom ?
She is not afraid to die .
Put your hands on your head .
I didn't have enough time to do everything that needed to be done .
I intend to meet Tom at the airport .
The thief used a screwdriver to break into the car .
We'll find another way .
Is that allowed ?
What did you think Tom would do ?
We don't have any bread left .
Tom lost consciousness .
Tom didn't take his hat off .
Tom treated Mary like a queen .
They are not sisters .
Everyone knows .
I got up thirty minutes ago .
My client is willing to make a deal .
I handed the mike to Tom .
This T-shirt is too small for me .
I would have been happier if I had stayed there .
Stay away from here .
I understood everything you said .
What is your occupation ?
I assure you that that isn't necessary .
I'd explain it to you , but your brain would explode .
I asked Tom why he was crying .
She promised that she would pay me this week , but she didn't keep her word .
We often play chess .
It'll probably rain tomorrow .
I asked Tom for permission to do that .
"Doc" is an abbreviation of "doctor" .
The flights haven't left yet .
May I smoke here ?
You're the one who got me in trouble in the first place .
Where did you go ?
We want to talk with you .
She seems to know something important .
It was a beautiful speech .
I asked Tom if he wanted to go abroad .
I don't know when he came back from France .
Can I go to the mall with you ?
I can't help doubting his honesty .
This is our job .
It was time to leave .
I want a new coat .
He was severe with his children .
Tom saw Mary sitting on her porch as he drove by .
I haven't read all of these books .
She assembles computers .
They don't help .
Tom is walking up the stairs .
This is our last chance to do that .
I didn't believe anything Tom said .
I'm a human being .
You should be brief .
He has no children .
We should talk to Tom .
You need this .
Are you in this picture ?
You ought to thank him .
I didn't buy anything .
We've run out of gasoline .
The rich are getting richer .
Tom looked after my dog while I was away .
How exactly did Tom die ?
Tom seemed to be unwilling to do what we wanted him to do .
You're so helpful .
We're flying over the Pacific .
I've never noticed that before .
He gave me several books .
You know the law .
Are they pacifists ?
She has shoulder-length hair .
He threw a stone at the dog .
Money can't buy happiness . However , it's more comfortable to cry in a Maserati than on a bike .
I think that Tom should stay .
To the best of my knowledge , the lake is the deepest at this point .
Tom has a twin brother .
He adhered to the original plan .
How do we get out of here ?
When did Tom die ?
My father is a native French speaker and my mother is a native English speaker .
Have you lost weight ?
We need more money .
I love what you've done with the place .
I want to talk to your mother .
Tom seems very busy .
I think he is angry .
Just look at what Tom did .
Can you drive a car ?
I pulled the trigger .
Tom doesn't like coffee with sugar .
Does it taste okay ?
Does Tom know you were born in Boston ?
Tom felt sad .
I was invited to go abroad , but I don't want to .
Change your clothes .
That helps sometimes .
We can run away from everything , except from our conscience .
That's going to be difficult .
I want you to be my coach .
They all looked busy .
Tom is willing to try new things .
Tom was very slow .
Tom is willing to do almost anything for Mary .
It happens all the time .
I want to eat some chocolate ice cream .
It's a fish .
The flame flickered for a moment , then died out .
We're best friends .
Where do we go from here ?
When I went into his room , he showed me the numerous trophies he had won during the twenty years he had played golf .
Tom won't go see Mary .
I'm supposed to go .
Tom left his wallet at home .
Tom is a pig .
I think that we'd better buy more food .
He asked me if I wanted to go abroad .
I want to buy some dark glasses .
There's a magazine in my room .
Tom handed the broom to Mary .
I'm not an engineer .
Feel free to get yourself a drink if you are thirsty .
Have you ever heard of a man named Tom Jackson ?
Tom isn't going to do that until Monday .
Tom is looking at me .
We've got a question .
Have you ever been to Boston in the summer ?
What's the weather tomorrow ?
Check that car out .
Are you paid well ?
You should call the police .
I'm not pessimistic .
In doing anything , do your best .
We're scared because we've heard two people are going to be fired .
I will show you around the city .
I'm smarter than you are .
I've won three times .
This isn't right .
We had no choice but to return home .
How's the food in that restaurant ?
Tom said he'd help me .
Have you dyed your hair ?
It may be that he likes his job .
Tom kissed Mary .
I thought you said you were going to buy me a drink .
Exercise every day .
I can't give you the answer today .
Are you happy , Tom ?
Tom has lived in Boston since 2013 .
Try this candy .
This is never going to end .
I've already told you I don't plan to do that .
The people are friendly here .
I tried to persuade Tom to come home .
You're supposed to be in bed , aren't you ?
Tom often doesn't keep his promises .
I looked around for my glasses , but I couldn't find them .
My parents aren't home .
Mary is Tom's aunt .
Tom started sweating .
Open your mouth and close your eyes .
Tom didn't do that the right way .
This is my friend .
My liver is heavily damaged .
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013 .
I'm rarely this angry .
The cab arrived late .
Thirteen people are injured .
I appreciate your coming all the way .
I don't think that it means anything .
Tom needed our help .
I'm very bad at chess .
What have we got to lose ?
I still need to pay my rent .
I'd like you to pay the money in advance .
Tom can't play the piano .
Is it your birthday today ?
Please tell Tom Mary called .
It's so nice to finally meet you .
It was a mess .
I wonder whether you really understood .
I love your house .
Swimming is good for your health .
I'm worried about all of you .
Are you already drunk ?
Tom didn't even try to do the right thing .
Tom left his hat in my room .
The train was derailed .
Tom may have heard us .
Tom is washing the car .
Leave those here .
I don't see your name here .
You are strong .
I'm afraid he is ill .
Tom is going to sit here .
You disappointed me .
I need sugar .
Man is the only animal that can use fire .
I was going to share it with you .
I met him recently .
Tom wants you to get here as soon as possible .
Tom is looking for something .
I'm a client .
Thanks for showing me the way .
Tom doesn't know who Mary's boyfriend is .
Tom took his daughter Mary to the park .
Have you seen Tom recently ?
How does he do it ?
Every religion prohibits murder .
I have nobody to talk to .
Let's listen to some jazz .
Tom didn't go to Boston .
When I opened the door of the refrigerator , an apple fell out .
I was kicked out of the store .
Tom has been a very good friend .
Many families left to make a new life on the frontier .
I heard a bell ringing .
Could you knock a little off the price ?
This is no joke .
Tom knew he no longer needed to be there .
Tom is the one who taught me how to play tennis .
We didn't wait with Tom .
Tom was playing basketball with a group of friends .
Tell Tom how much you paid for that .
Tom won't be home until tomorrow .
The bear ate an apple .
What'll you have to drink ?
You're too drunk .
I am afraid of dogs .
Let us know whether you can come .
Tom is good at golf , isn't he ?
I cleared the table .
My shoulder hurts .
Tom is really embarrassed .
This cake is sweet .
Tom isn't scared to die .
This bridge is made of iron .
I'm looking for Tom right now .
The trouble is that I don't have much money now .
You're going to need help .
Tom was one of the best .
It's very likely that someone will be waiting for us .
Take it .
I used to smoke .
It's a chance we've got to take .
There's a time for everything .
That's exactly what I've been saying .
This is the first time I've heard that word .
Drink in moderation .
Tom told me he thought Mary would be ready by the time we got there .
Tom challenged me to a duel .
It sounds like a fun job .
She never thinks about him .
I'll wash the apple .
I thought you needed money .
Tom is angry at Mary .
You're a philosopher , aren't you ?
What more do you want me to do ?
Do you have a larger size ?
I think Mary is very attractive .
Such accidents can happen from time to time .
Tom gave the money back to Mary .
Tom has never been much of a talker .
I'm too tired to argue .
I still don't write Chinese well .
You'll find a job .
I used to hate Boston .
Do you want something to do ?
Welcome to your new home .
Thai is the official language in Thailand .
Let's wash the car .
I honestly didn't think Tom would be here .
This is my favorite movie .
I'm very fortunate that I wasn't hurt .
At last , you've hit the nail on the head !
You have to share the cake equally .
Six divided by two is three .
We want to rent an apartment in the city .
Why would Tom want to work for Mary ?
I don't think that there's anybody in the classroom .
I'm one of your students .
Do you want me to stay with Tom ?
We can get you help .
I don't know where Tom goes to school .
I didn't recognize Tom's car .
I don't eat pork .
Jump !
You can make a cake with flour , milk and an egg .
Mary denied having stolen the money .
Tom isn't sure Mary will do that .
Could you help me , please ?
I don't have my driver's license with me .
I looked around me .
Say goodbye to your friends .
We'll attack .
Why me ?
My new assistant is eager to learn the ropes .
My wife is very upset .
Are you in Boston ?
I've never beaten Tom .
I thought that maybe you could use some company .
Everybody gets what they deserve .
I know that .
You've said nothing so far .
Tom can swim faster than Mary can .
I hope to see you next year .
Is there anything else you want to know ?
I can't go back to prison .
This isn't the first time .
Does Tom know a lot about Australia ?
Do you know this word ?
Tom barely passed the test .
I like to read .
I wasn't aware that Tom wanted to do that .
I have a lot of friends in Boston .
Get out !
Tom doesn't give up .
The installation is now complete .
My priorities aren't the same as yours .
Do you want Tom to go to Boston ?
Can coffee stains be removed ?
Be kind to the children .
Tom wasn't sure he wanted to do that .
Take off your jacket .
I want ten plates .
Does it make any sense ?
Just because I'm a wolf , everyone thinks I'm the bad guy .
Nobody will listen to you .
Have you ever given money to a beggar ?
What has Tom done now ?
Have you ever actually seen it ?
Tom said that it was too risky to go there alone .
I want to kill somebody .
She doesn't like being alone , but I prefer it like that .
The war has ended .
Tom wasn't able to concentrate .
I wonder if you'd do me a favor .
Tom is very good at playing the piano .
When will you be coming back to Boston ?
Stop shooting !
What did you eat last night ?
It was chaotic .
I didn't know what Tom's plans were .
Tom cheats .
I don't want it .
Do you think Tom might like to go to Boston with us ?
I'm not a good swimmer .
Tom must be asleep .
Everyone was wearing gloves .
Can we talk with Tom ?
I never realized how much I'd miss you .
Tom wanted to study French with Mary .
While in London , he visited the British Museum .
I'm not worried about Tom . I'm worried about you , Mary .
Tom found a golf ball in the garden .
I think Tom is mistaken .
Tom wanted to call Mary .
Didn't your mother teach you to say thank you ?
My father died of lung cancer .
Tom died yesterday .
He gave me what money he had .
Tom was coming down the hill .
We don't have any choice .
I swim very fast .
Where's your girlfriend ?
He's the laziest person I know .
Do you know what your name means ?
Can you come ?
I come from a small family .
This fruit tastes bad .
Tom was on the same plane that I was .
He turned the corner .
We have a lot of fun together .
Which sport do you like the most ?
The trouble is that he thinks only of himself .
A doctor quickly cut off his left arm and stopped the heavy bleeding .
I don't know French .
I'm not very religious .
What were you fired for ?
I think that's a hoax .
Have you already decided where to go ?
He feels happy in spite of his failure .
What's the nicest thing Tom has ever done for you ?
I thought Tom was with you .
If you had a time machine , which year would you visit ?
Why didn't you stop them ?
I don't remember anything .
Go and sit by your father .
Tom will never come back here .
Tom went on board the plane .
What good would that do ?
Are you very hungry ?
You have to choose one .
She is an appalling cook .
It's not you I'm worried about .
I was afraid to say no .
Tom has stopped going to school .
I'm only interested in nonstop flights .
Tom has already forgotten all about you .
You know that isn't true .
Have some ham .
No one could've predicted this .
I fell asleep on the sofa .
My older sister is beautiful .
Fire !
You can't leave Tom behind .
We walked here .
It would be better for you to stay away from such a man .
Tom looked great .
Are you trying to blackmail me ?
"I was just talking to Tom" . "About what" ? "About what Mary did" .
Tom had a rough couple of years .
Do you know me ?
My father is at home .
Is everybody happy ?
You know her .
This time it's my turn to pay .
The children are afraid of Tom .
Our kids need something to do .
Did you read the letter that Tom wrote ?
She has a good figure .
We were like brothers .
Do you like cities ?
We need to find out who did this .
We enjoyed playing chess last night .
Tom doesn't want you .
I'll go .
He made me a suit .
There is not much hope .
I oppose it .
What were you dreaming about ?
It's work .
I'm glad to see you , Tom .
Tom's answer surprised me .
One must do one's best in everything .
I think it's unhealthy to eat more than 20 oranges a day .
They skip school all the time .
You'll have to get off at the next station .
His poetry does not translate into Japanese .
We actually saw the accident .
Tom left the book on the table .
Tom got here ten minutes ago .
Tom returned the book to Mary .
I heard that she came here .
Tom wants to sell his house .
The concert was broadcast live .
Why didn't I die ?
It may be true .
I'm very grateful for your help .
Why can't I stay here ?
I wish I could buy a motorcycle .
I'm unable to translate this sentence .
Ain't she cute ?
Aren't you forgetting something ?
No one believed him .
It's a lot of fun going on trips .
Don't do that in this room .
Tom doesn't have many weekends off .
It'd be better if you didn't associate with men like that .
Do Tom and Mary like each other ?
How much does it cost to get in ?
You're a valuable client .
You don't have to thank me .
What are you doing ?
They should thank me .
I should be back here by 2:30 .
I don't know either girl .
It amazed us that she had been to Brazil alone .
A lot of Canadian tourists visit Boston .
I could use some sleep .
Prices were strictly regulated during the war .
That's very kind of you .
He continued walking for a while .
You're the smartest person I know .
Tom is honest .
French was the only foreign language they taught at my school .
That blue dress suits you very well .
Many accidents happen every year .
This is the culmination of years of work .
I wonder whether I've done everything I was supposed to do .
Do you think I should take it ?
Are you just going to stand there all day ?
Why did you think it was a bad idea to do that ?
Who gave Tom that recipe book ?
Tom is a teacher , right ?
Tom stood , too .
There are no strings attached .
They reached their goal .
This flower smells nice .
Don't throw that out .
You're impatient .
Do they have money ?
Is that going to be OK ?
Moving to a smaller place will reduce the expenses .
When did you come back from Australia ?
We're all praying for Tom's recovery .
I never go out without buying something .
We know you're busy .
I wrote Tom a long letter last night .
Never forget that .

It's difficult to understand his theory .
They're all the same size .
I can't remember what we were doing at that time .
They don't have one .
That's not going to change .
I suspect that Tom knows Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore .
I cried all night .
It's all Greek to me .
Tom doesn't want to fight .
Can you give an exact report of what happened ?
This isn't easy .
Why are you wearing my dress ?
Tom is a good actor .
I thought you were joking .
Let's wait until October .
I'd like to leave this book with you .
Nobody hurt me .
The sauce needs more chili .
Everyone began boarding the bus .
What else did Tom say about me ?
You have a very beautiful daughter .
My cat is hiding under the stove .
I think I did that once .
I'm getting closer .
I'm tired today .
Try explaining that to Tom .
He's feeling well .
This is a dog .
I swear I didn't see anything .
I'd like to go .
I think Tom did a good job .
I've decided to watch this movie .
You speak French , right ?
According to my calculation , she should be in India by now .
I thought Tom had answered all your questions .
I can do my job without your help .
Both of Tom's sons died in the war .
I'm convinced Tom killed himself .
We saw you come in .
I want to be alone .
Tom brought along his younger sister .
I've never eaten alligator meat .
It was a bad situation .
When did she say those words ?
I can't bear the pain .
I didn't like living in Boston .
Nothing was out of place .
Was it you , Tom ?
I wasn't avoiding you .
What are you doing for New Year's Eve ?
You're a great writer .
School is over at 3:30 .
Do you plan to buy that car ?
Will you join us ?
I'm able to read French .
Tom , I must talk to you .
Tom knows that Mary is wrong .
I won't eat here again .
I think Tom is still in Boston .
I'm very sorry about Tom .
Boys , as a rule , are taller than girls .
I don't want anything from you .
Tom didn't let his children go to Mary's party .
I was shaking like a leaf .
I like pizza very much .
He did the reverse of what I asked .
I'm in love with you .
What do you want me to do about it ?
It’s such an honor for me to be here with you all .
I don't like living in Boston .
The wind slammed the door shut .
Do you want this or don't you ?
Tom isn't richer than me .
I never want to see you again .
I know what Tom did to them .
This is the first time I've seen one of these .
How are you going to do that ?
Please think about that .
Tom's password was easy to guess .
I don't want to say that to Tom .
What's in your closet ?
Who wants to cut the cake ?
He speaks five languages .
Do you believe in omens ?
Nobody's busy .
There is a library in our city .
Tom told me that he likes to swim .
Tom told me Mary was sick .
They monitored the enemy's radio communications .
Are you a doctor , sir ?
I'm sure you can do it .
You're here awfully early today .
You'll forget about me someday .
They were satisfied .
She tried .
I don't like spring .
I'm lying in bed with a killer hangover .
Tom served five days in jail last year after pleading guilty to drunken driving .
I think we should stay and fight .
Everyone's worried .
Some apples rotted on the tree .
You are lying .
Tom lives near me .
I have a daughter living in Boston .
Lock the door .
"You can't wear that" . "Why not" ?
Tom doesn't have to take the test again .
I want to know when Tom is planning on doing that .
You are hopeless .
I don't think Tom kissed Mary .
I will obey .
I loaded the dishes into the dishwasher .
Her house is surrounded by a white fence .
They will cut down on their expenses .
The prisoner was released .
You're too weak .
This isn't French .
You need my help .
I've been able to drive for more than twenty years .
Is there a post office around here ?
Tom handed me the letter .
I think we're going to need it all .
My family are all very well .
They were from Australia .
We only have a few hours .
The room was quiet .
There's a problem I have to talk to you about .
I can't drink milk .
Late autumn in Scotland is rather cold .
The judge's decision is final .
As soon as she got on the train , it pulled out of the station .
Let me tell you something about Boston .
Tom jacked up the car .
Tom woke up earlier than Mary .
When was the last time Tom helped you do anything ?
Let's play badminton on Monday .
Who owns that car ?
We're from Boston .
You'd be surprised how well Tom can speak French .
I studied for a year in Boston .
She's still under age .
I'm a busy person .
I would've done the same thing Tom did .
I finally washed the car .
You missed .
My children are at school .
Everything is upside down .
I hope that tomorrow isn't too bad .
Tom is going to try it again .
Please tell me about your problem .
Eventually , she succeeded .
Tom turned off his desk lamp .
Sit here .
Everybody thinks Tom is a little crazy .
Tom refused to talk to me .
Forty people were present .
Somebody forged my signature .
It's hard to believe .
You left your lights on .
She has 3 , 500 books in her library and many of them are first editions .
Tom comes here practically every day .
I've never seen this design before .
I sang a song .
You can come with us .
Tom didn't need to take a break .
My sister is younger than me .
Why did Tom not want to go to Australia ?
I eat a lot .
The reason I came to Boston is to meet the woman I hope to marry .
Tom is no longer my friend .
I forgot to pay the electric bill .
He who laughs last laughs best .
Hey Tom , I want to talk to you .
How're we doing ?
Tom has to pay .
I am afraid you are wrong .
Nobody was home .
How did your students like that ?
That's what we'd like to do .
Some animals don't have blood .
It's time to show your cards .
Tom left his coat downstairs .
Mary folded the clothes and put them into the laundry basket .
We both cried .
Would you like to play soccer with us ?
My pen has been stolen .
I couldn't understand Tom .
We spent a lot of money on furnishing our house .
Can we go to lunch now ?
I've always hated you .
I'm throwing in the towel .
It's not a money issue .
Tom is very worried about Mary .
Tom found the door closed .
Actually that's a smart idea .
I'll ask Tom .
You must write more neatly .
I suppose you love her .
They laughed at his mistake .
It's in my jacket pocket .
Tom noticed that Mary was smiling .
How long will this cold weather continue ?
Tom can't fire Mary .
I don't know how long I'll need to stay in Boston .
Be good .
I am better .
What kind of movie do you want to watch ?
Tom said Mary was likely to be early .
This is all I need right now .
What do they look like ?
Where and when did that happen ?
I hope you're wrong about that .
I'm too tired to help you do that now .
The boy carved his name on the tree .
Tom grew up in the same neighborhood that I did .
I've been in Boston for a few months .
Tom has told me everything .
The food athletes eat is just as important as what kind of exercises they do .
Was it thrilling ?
He added a little sugar and milk to his tea .
Write something .
You like chocolate , don't you ?
I'm going this way .
I just wanted another chance .
Why are you being so kind to me ?
Tom is going to quit doing that .
You could talk to Tom .
I don't know if she will go there with me .
The dog is afraid of the horse .
Tom says he feels better now .
He is living in Tokyo .
We'll need it .
I think they both are married .
I'm a dog trainer .
She smiled , waving her hand .
I haven't even thought about that possibility .
Tom is going to be angry .
I missed the last train .
You need to take care of this right away .
Look up the number in the telephone book .
I'm a deeply religious man and believe in life after death .
We're friends .
Business is slow .
How do you think Tom will convince Mary to marry him ?
We understand .
Stop being so naive .
Which one will they choose ?
I want soup .
My silence made Tom angry .
I left the window open all night .
Everyone knows it .
Tom always lies to me .
There are 150 museums in Kazakhstan .
I don't see Tom every day .
Tom told me I'm overconfident .
Tom hates raw onions .
He doesn't have any friends to play with .
We overslept .
French is an interesting language .
Tom and Mary voted for John .
Tom will be fine .
It's so boring .
Don't forget to turn the light off .
I thought I'd be able to help you do that .
I don't understand your question .
What am I supposed to do after I finish doing this ?
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary hadn't done that .
She got him to do anything she wanted him to do .
You do want that , don't you ?
You seem to be suffering a lot .
How long will you remain in Boston ?
The police officer put the cuffs on Tom .
Let's go celebrate your promotion .
Tom found Christmas presents hidden under his parents' bed .
Have you decided whether or not you're going to sell your house ?
Are you sure that that's the only solution ?
I'm a lot bigger than you are .
Tom said he was willing to pay up to $300 .
I go to school .
That wasn't hard .
My sister was a beautiful woman .
I'm coming back to Boston in October .
Laughter is contagious .
It was perfect .
Tom has a private yacht .
I already have this book .
Go to your room and wait there until I call you .
You're driving me crazy .
Explain yourself .
The government is trying to bring things back to normal .
I hope Tom doesn't tell Mary about what we did .
Those hens lay eggs almost every day .
Did you return Tom's books ?
I'd like to lie down .
Can you drive me to the airport tomorrow morning ?
The movie has already begun .
Why are you making us do this ?
How much do you owe me ?
Do you know anything about his family ?
I'm untalented .
Tom got a bonus .
I'm not listening .
I woke up late yesterday .
Do you like to cook ?
Tom lived in Boston three years ago .
We just don't think it's cool .
Would you be able to do that today ?
Tom didn't need a ride to Boston .
Does Tom ever snore ?
I hope that somebody will do that .
Tell Tom why you did that .
Tom can't help me today .
Bring your brother with you .
Tom should've told Mary about what happened .
I finished my sandwich .
Tom drove very fast .
You're going to miss the train .
May I use your dictionary ?
I am eighteen years old .
I'm against the death penalty .
Take care .
Did you go to the book fair ?
These things only happen in Sweden .
I like mysteries .
Please ask Tom to come inside .
How are you feeling , Tom ?
Tom needs to change his eating habits .
I used to think Tom was cute .
I guess I'm wrong .
Tom isn't going to leave us .
You've lost a lot of blood .
I hope you come to my party .
How much longer am I going to have to do this ?
I won't tell .
What are you punishing them for ?
My grandfather was an archaeologist .
Tom said that he didn't have insurance .
We're not going to sing that song .
Tom is handsome .

I want to talk to you about last night .
Who did you learn that from ?
Part of the roof fell off .
We were just going .
They don't care about that .
Tom goes to school on foot .
Did you return the books ?
Tom doesn't think I can do this .
You do know how to do that , don't you ?
You know that I'm telling the truth .
Tom doesn't trust us .
You were delirious .
What are you humming ?
You're single , aren't you ?
Tom crawled underneath the bed .
Maybe you should quit drinking .
I will try as hard as I can .
Are you sure ?
Let Tom eat what he wants .
The glass is full of water .
We have no secrets .
I owe you nothing .
My suitcase got lost .
I don't think Tom is home .
Mary is your older sister , isn't she ?
Tom tried to impress a girl .
He assured me of his help .
Everywhere seems to be crowded .
Tell Tom to stand .
Please don't leave me again .
Tom arrived with three other people .
Give me that magazine , please .
What else can they do ?
Why don't we explain it to the jury ?
Tom didn't go to the dance .
I didn't recognize your voice .

Tom doesn't understand why we did that .
I can't decide what to do next .

In an effort to declutter his apartment , Tom is going to get rid of one or two unneeded items per day for the next twelve months .
Where have you been ?
Why doesn't Tom like to eat fish ?
She went on a trip for a few days .
You're among friends .
If you don't want to say anything , you don't have to .
Tom gave Mary a kiss and got out of the car .
That sounds strange , doesn't it ?
I knew Tom didn't know that you were the ones who had done that .
You ought to see a doctor .
This chair is very comfortable .
That country has natural resources .
Tom used to play guitar .
I'm ready to leave .
Do you think that Tom will do that tomorrow ?
I'd like you to come at nine .
Why are you sorry for something you haven't done ?
I was alone .
You've never had a pet , have you ?
Tom is no longer working for us .
You're concerned , aren't you ?
I really need to go to the bathroom .
Tom thinks I don't need to do that .
I'm guilty .
I know somebody who speaks French very well .
I failed to get there in time .
I remember Tom .
Why do you always do that ?
Let me help you . Your bag looks very heavy .
I don't know what more I can do to help .
I hope you're OK .
I'm very glad that you're here .

Mary is very pretty .
Guess what happened to me .
How long have you been doing this ?
I need to ask you for a little favor .

It'll take a few seconds .
Tom can get to work faster on bicycle than by car .
I'll be OK .
I already know .
I'd like to make an appointment for tomorrow .

Tom lived in downtown Boston .
It's getting darker and darker .
I just want a fresh start .
That's not what I mean .
Tom shook Mary's hand .
I'm not who you think I am .
You're going to electrocute yourself if you aren't careful .
What happened on the bus ?
This doesn't concern me .
England was invaded by the Danes .
Correct me if I'm wrong .
I think Tom's cheating .
Was Tom the one who told you that you ought to do that ?

When I was in high school , I woke up at 6 every morning .
I didn't have any friends in Boston .
What Tom predicted would happen has happened .
I'll let you know .
We want to live here .
Have I come to the right place ?
Can you remember that ?
We'd like to ask you a couple of questions .
Are you saying you can fix it ?

You won .
I still don't know how that happened .

Tom and I like the same kind of music .
We all have missed you .
You're sarcastic .
I'll do as you advise .
Tom took his glasses off and put them on the bedside table .
I'm diplomatic .
Rents are high in this area .
Give me some beer .
I'm getting tired of your complaints .
I didn't even think about that .
Many animals are nocturnal .
Are you ready to go to the mall ?

They are in favor of your plan .

Here is your change .
Tom was tried for carjacking .
I worked as a piano tuner for many years .
Everyone stared at me .
Tom said that Mary didn't cry .
The parrot is dead .
Mary is a formidable woman .
Is your wife home ?
I see you've already met everyone .
I am badly in need of your help .
I'm not fussy .
Do you know where she is ?
Why don't you come , too ?
At the top , there was a clump of trees .
You'd better get started .
I'm surprised to see you .
I haven't found the antidote .
"Thank you" . "You're welcome" .
I'd like to go out with you .
I need a new chainsaw .
Tom opened his mouth wide .
I think it's over now .
Tom woke up around noon .
The money on the desk isn't mine .
Thank you for the flowers .

I know this is tough .
I think you're lost .
She painted the wall pink .
If I die , I want you to keep this ring .
Tom was brought up in Australia .
Those things happen sometimes .
Have you been promoted ?
War affects us all .
I have an idea for a movie .
You don't know what it is , do you ?
Don't let her go out after dark .
Which university are you studying at ?
Be watchful .
Tom asked a stupid question .
You've outdone yourself this time .
Tom is afraid of Mary .
That's how it should be .
Tom was completely clueless .
Somebody was murdered .
Tom isn't into first-person shooter games .
Was it a full moon or a new moon ?
This is for internal use .
I agree with you on that point .
I'm not going to talk about that .
Why do people kill themselves ?
Pick up your trash .
I'm not sure .
I haven't told Tom .
What country would you like to visit next ?
You have a kid , don't you ?
I think that's why Tom didn't do that .
We didn't have much rain last month .
Have you ever talked to anybody about this ?
She is unsociable .
Tom didn't write this .
I want to give you the chance to do that .
Tom's dad is rich .
We have a wide choice of books .

Do you want milk ?
You're ugly .
I made you feel uncomfortable , didn't I ?
I'm used to this sort of thing .

Tom is pleased with his success .
Tom's a klutz .
I can do that in thirty minutes .

Tom's house is for sale .
Tom stole some money from Mary's purse .
Tom has finished eating .
It's a full time job .
Tom is stronger than I am .
You are in my way .
I'm not going to get up .
I didn't think you would want to do that .
Why did we fail ?
It isn't easy to make women happy .
I bought this shirt yesterday .
I haven't heard from him since last June .
You're making a big mistake .
Could you pass me the pepper , please ?
I can't help you right now .
Did Tom help his mother yesterday ?
My neighbors are my friends .
I need to talk to you about your grades .
Tom told me he wasn't upset .
Tom is one of John's buddies .
Have you brushed your teeth ?
I do not want any bananas at all .
It's snowing there .
That was our last chance .
Tom isn't bluffing .
Where's the airport ?
The topic is worth discussing .
Do you really want to learn another language ?

When in doubt , consult a dictionary .

I'm going to go wash my hands .
Tom will always love you .
These glasses are cool .
They're children .
I'm sorry . I don't have a lot of time .
I'm a beginner in French .
Forget about that right now .
It may not have been as difficult as Tom said it was .
I know that some people appreciate my work .
Do you like chocolate icing ?
Tom signed the document .
Something offended Tom .
I'm just not sure what to do .
We played chess all night .
I'm surprised Tom accepted the offer .
I'm waiting for a friend .
Please let me explain .
I'm doing what I want to do .
Tom chased Mary .
This is never going to end .
It's not that far .
Somebody's got to stay with you .
Tom hung his coat up behind the door .
Tom pretended not to notice .
It was nice and cool there .
You were busy last week .
I am going to stay here for a couple of days .
We'll be OK , Tom .
I didn't think that you were allowed to do that .
Would you like one of these ?
Tom had to pawn his guitar in order to pay his bills .
There's nothing you can do to help me .
Tom could do a lot better if he tried .
Why don't you rest a bit ?
What did you think of that book ?
He was brought up by his uncle .
Don't ever do that again .
I haven't missed a single meeting .
Tom said Mary was crying .
I didn't even know you had a horse .
Everything changes .
Why are you two fighting ?
She has gone shopping .
The first lesson is easy .
The weather is beautiful .
Everything was where it was supposed to be .
I was third in line .
My cousin's house is small .
"Shall I take a message" ? "No , thank you" .
He did a good bit of waiting .
You can't skateboard here .
I think he's an honest man .
I'd like to buy that one .
Look out for Tom .
I'm sorry , I dialed the wrong number .
Tom was one of three contestants .
We're still working on that .
I know who killed Tom's dog .
I don't want to eat a live lobster .
It's a shame the way natural resources are wasted .
I think we'd better get out of here .
Let's hope the weather is good tomorrow .
This housework is driving me crazy .
Tom is not interested .
I'll make sure Tom writes to you .
How do you say "I love you" in French ?
I'm still having fun .
Tom barely ate .
What's the third choice ?
I think Tom was right .
Tom says he's not happy .
The kitten wants to sleep .
Don't worry . You'll make it .
Our teacher speaks French as well as English .
I need printer paper .
I found something .
I want to open an account .
You don't sound so sure of it .
I'm sure they'll win .
I'm busy , as always .
I used to live there .
I agreed to write that letter .
They're unreliable .
Tom put the key in his pocket .
I hope that you enjoy spicy food .
It was a pleasure meeting you , Tom .
I'll see you next Wednesday .
How does it help us ?
My friend doesn't believe that ghosts exist .
Tom told us you were busy .
Tom is still in Australia .
You have plenty of time to catch the train .
I think this shirt can be thrown away .
Not even Tom knows the truth .
I thought I had paid the monthly fee , but I received a phone call from the school saying that the bill still needs to be paid .
We've met several times .
Tom was afraid of that .
I lost my wallet .
I have to help Tom clean his room .
What else do they need ?
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that , but he was unable to .
Hi , I'm Tom .
Please stop looking at me .
He has large blue eyes .
What's wrong with Boston ?
I saw Tom and Mary .
I don't think we should drink this water .
I forgive you .
I asked Tom if I was on the list of people invited to the party .
Do you remember that night ?
I can't talk to women .
I hope it's enough .
Stop embarrassing me .
Tom was at school yesterday , wasn't he ?
I took Tom's hand .
Tom can drive .
What kind of monkeys are those ?
As far as I know , I'm in perfect health .
I wasn't invited to the party .
We all laughed .

We hope you'll succeed .
Would you unlock the gate , please ?
I think I've broken my arm .
Can you see without your glasses ?
Tom wanted to play .
I usually study about three hours a day .
He sang and sang .
I thought we were going to crash .
Tom was doing that the wrong way .
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow ?
Speak louder , please .
I guess you don't read much .
Tom eats a lot more than Mary does .
Send Tom to me .
Tom became confused .
Are you well ?
Tom sat on the sofa , flipping through the pages of a magazine .
She always complains of her teacher .
Mine is better than yours .
Don't you understand what's happening here ?
I didn't realize you were interested in it .
Tom won't try it again .
Tom stopped .
I couldn't help myself .
You're too young to die .
Would you look after my cat ?
I just got here yesterday .
We're replaceable .
Tom was very slow .
I've got to speak to Tom .
I was ordered to wait .
My car is in bad shape .
I'll stay here .
This is the spot .
Tom chickened out .
How did you come to know such a wonderful girl ?
You should be more careful .
It was irresistible .
Tom wants to do his homework right now .
I'm trying to do my best .
Did Tom say something ?
We're going to take good care of Tom .
I never understood that .
If that were true , what would you do ?
I've never been so proud of you .
I think my mom knows .
They'll get caught .
It's as easy as that .
Tom said he would come to the party .
My sister has been knitting since this morning .
Frankly speaking , he is wrong .
My wife did not attend the party and neither did I .
Tom looked in the wrong direction .
I still have work to do .
Making friends is easy when you're young .
You've already won .
She has a degree in biology .
Tom doesn't seem to know the answer .
The cost of living in Japan is going down .
I have lots of work to do tomorrow .
You work hard .
I know you have a girlfriend .
He sent flowers to his mother .
Go drink some water .
You can come at any time .
Why do you ask ?
I will read a book .
This book is worth reading twice .
The siren blew .
Am I the only one who doesn't agree with you ?
We both are friends .
Tom was finally captured .
I said I wasn't hungry .
The speech lasted thirty minutes .
Tom will come to my house tonight .
Tom wants to get married , but not to Mary .
Thanks for believing in me .
We're on your side .
I like this drawing .
I'm doing this for my family .
Don't copy my answers .
I know the rules .
Tom hoped that the war wouldn't last long .
It probably wasn't Tom who did that .
Would you like me to help you with your suitcases ?
They're kids .
Are you going to cry ?
You'd better look at it .
You really are rude , aren't you ?
Did Tom have any enemies ?
Tom seems to be very confused .
Everyone changes .
I hope Tom isn't pessimistic .
Where did Tom live ?
Tom likes playing basketball .
Have you ever eaten in a restaurant alone ?
You wanted me to get a job , so I did .
They're in danger .
He used me as a guinea pig .
The African elephant has bigger ears than the Asian elephant .
Tom couldn't eat solid food for a week .
There's hardly any coffee left in the pot .
He was about to speak .
Is it Japanese food ?
They stayed at a luxury hotel .
She shooed him outdoors .
I know three guys named Tom .
Tom spends money as soon as he gets it .
I threw a stone at the bird .
I have returned .
We'll do it .
It was too difficult .
No one was awake yet .
My father is tall .
I didn't tell him everything .
I am fortunate enough to have access to an excellent library .
They live in another country .
After the work day was over , Tom went home to his wife .
Elephants have two ears .
Tom opened his laptop .
Open your window .

I bumped into your dad yesterday .
I couldn't have been more wrong .

Tom is the one who did that .
Tom ate half the cake by himself .
Tom goes to mass every Sunday morning .
Tom can speak three foreign languages .
You've been paroled .
Sorry to be so direct , but how much did you pay for this ?
My brother pretended to be working very hard .
Don't let the dog inside .
You're too gullible .
I saw him first .
Tom didn't know Mary was engaged .
Can you please tell me what's happening ?
Why don't you want to wear a tie ?
To my surprise , he had a beautiful voice .
Tom will talk .
There were only six people in the meeting .
I wish I had a better memory .
I know you want to go home .
How do I turn off the projector ?
He is not the shy boy he used to be .
The city of Boston has one of the best children's hospitals in the United States .
I'm not going to take the job .
You're agitated .
Tom will probably be upset .
The glass dropped from his hand .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary's father .
What a day !
You can't come tomorrow .
That's exactly what I meant .
That is very expensive !
Tom won't name names .
Take things as they are .
You look serious .
You did not say so .
Paper burns quickly .
Tom didn't know Mary was lying .
I'd do it .
You misinterpreted what I wrote .
She doesn't want him to buy an expensive engagement ring .
A chain of events led to the outbreak of the war .
Tom bought a large house on Park Street .
We never spoke about that .
I have insurance .
I'll take a look at it .
Would you like to go to the movies with me ?
I didn't know Tom had a sports car .
The lake water is very cold .
She listens to him .
I hope you and your friend have fun here .
How come you know so much about Japanese history ?
Lunch should be ready soon .
We didn't know the whole story at that time .
Tom said that he didn't like chocolate ice cream .
I'm afraid you've misunderstood me .
Mary is my niece .
Even Tom thinks so .
We stayed in Hawaii over Christmas .
A stray dog bit Tom .
Tom pumped up the tire .
This is the first time I've seen one of these .
Many attended his funeral .
Do you see them ?
Many thanks .
I can't go home .
That's hers .
You always do that for Tom , don't you ?
I can help you , too .
I didn't eat anything .
Can't you speak English ?
The actors appeared in historical costumes .
I'm unenthusiastic .
I want to learn as many languages as possible .
We can do a lot better than this .
Which way did they go ?
I couldn't have done it without you .
This is the best restaurant in the city .
Are you in there ?
Do you see a bear now ?
They didn't listen .
Tom spent New Year's Eve with his family .
I'm scared of dogs .
She will give a party next week .
I have a radio .
I liked climbing trees when I was a kid .
I know that Tom's upset .
I swept the kitchen floor .
It was a horrible scene .
I don't see that happening around here .
Hands off .
I closed my umbrella .
The Great Wall of China is more than 5 , 500 miles long .
All the guests have left .
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that .
I thought you were a ghost .
I am reading a book .
Do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
Mary was beautiful .
You're depressed .
Please don't laugh at me .
I got her a doll .
Does that clock work ?
We should build bridges , not walls .
Tom is helping them .
Some water , please .
I'd like you to do that for me .
Be careful when you cross the street .
We're very busy .
I made a deal with Tom .
Tom said that he was busy .
I'm a little tired .
Do you want to buy this ?
This chair is made of plastic .
Tom works .
They asked for help .
Tom returned before 2:30 .
It's identical .
That's what happened the last time .
It is unfair .
I knew you'd show up eventually .
Have you finished reading the novel ?
Do you use a deodorant ?
I heard what Tom said to Mary .
I have three children .
My birthday is close to yours .
He is a very smart boy .
She made up her mind to go to college .
He disappeared without a trace .
The soldiers on the boats would be easy targets .
Why do you keep saying things that you know aren't true ?
Tom seems to turn into a different person when he speaks French .
I asked Tom to go check on Mary .
Why did you hang up ?
I saw one .
He won't beat me .
Can you open it ?
Are you hot ?
The pain was mainly in my lower back .
What can I do for you ?
I can't say I wasn't disappointed .
Tom is scared to death .
Did you win a ribbon , too ?
I haven't eaten since breakfast .
We have many rainy days in June .
What would you like to do while you're in Australia ?
Tom seems to be jealous .
I'm not ugly .
I know you still love Tom .
Look at this photo .
I used to stay up late .
We have to figure out a way to keep Tom from seeing Mary .
Everyone saw what happened .
I don't think they're capable of doing that .
It couldn't have been easy .
I didn't like the plot of that movie .
I gave the dog two pieces of meat .
He made up his mind to be a doctor .
How was the concert ?
I drank a lot and can't remember much of what happened last night .
I hope Tom doesn't do that .
He knocked his knee against the chair .
Tom isn't even trying .
Tom didn't have to do that .
I really like you .
Safety is the most important thing .
My mother packed my suitcase for me .
I'm always on time .
You ought to see a doctor .
We're moving to Boston next week .
Tom didn't go alone .
Most people don't have a problem with that .
Tom helped a little .
Tom stepped on Mary's foot .
Most people want to experience happiness .
The doctor advised my father to give up smoking .
Tom realized Mary wasn't kidding .
We're twins .
It looks like Tom was right .
I can't believe you chickened out .
This is the best dictionary that I have .
The outcome of the upcoming election will be the hardest ever to predict .
I like the options that I have here .
That never happens here in Boston .
Take this medicine every six hours .
I didn't know you were looking for me .
An error was made .
We're going to go .
Is there something wrong with me ?
Can you explain what this means ?
I'm taking care of Tom this week .
She admired him .
My mother can't ride a bicycle .
Pray for me .
I'm sorry , but my answer is no .
I hope the work is finished .
Tom fell off the horse and broke his arm .
Put the cornbread on the table .
I didn't know Tom was so old .
It may save your life .
I'm twice your age .
Tom has a son and so do I .
You can't judge people by their looks .
Tom is sound asleep .
It's an adventure .
Do I have to go with you ?
That kind of complicates things .
I could've done that faster by myself .
How was the French class ?
Tom is very choosy .
Did you know Tom didn't like doing that ?
We're not perfect , but we try to be .
Which cup is yours ?
I'm eating rice now .
I don't have a wife .
I want to become a doctor .
I'm accustomed to getting up early .
I know you have to do that .
We are flying over the Pacific .
I really don't feel like talking .
Did you notice anything strange ?
I've bought myself a trumpet .
I know Tom started to do that .
You like elephants .
Is this what you were searching for ?
I used to paint .
African elephants are larger than Asian elephants .
My taxi should be here soon .
I know where Tom lives .
Do you like robots ?
You're a good mom .
How did Tom and Mary come to Boston ?
Tom is a plastic surgeon .
You don't deserve any of what I do to you .
We need to be ready .
I'm sure Tom misses Mary .
I heard a nightingale .
Hand me those papers .
I'm surprised it hasn't happened sooner .
Tom said that he understands why Mary doesn't want to do that .
What is it you'd like me to do ?
I don't think Tom knows that I think he's stupid .
I did my best to help Tom .
I wonder why Tom is being so quiet .
I'm originally from Australia .
I can't find my shoes .
How's your mother , Tom ?
I broke up with Tom .
I'm getting married to her in June .
Don't tell Tom what we did .
What sort of person are you ?
Tom never woke up .
Don't you ever get tired of doing that ?
Don't just eat fish . Eat meat , too .
I like to do my homework .
Ten years have gone by .
I went to his house at 3 o'clock , but he was out .
Must I hurry ?
I have two nephews .
Tom said he thought he could pass the test .
Do you have a ticket ?
Tom hasn't told us what he needs to do .
I'll have to come here every year .
I almost got fired .
Don't get angry , Tom .
I don't want to walk home by myself .
What do you know about him ?
When she was thirteen , she ran away from home .
My mother is constantly forgetting people's names .
I'm helping Tom .
Did you lock the doors ?
I appreciate your interest .
Can I spend the night ?
Why don't you come visit us ?
Tom does thirty pushups every day .
I was oblivious to the whole thing .
Do you want to know what Tom did ?
Tom was scared of me .
He's an author .
Where do you live now ?
Tom said he wasn't bored .
She is really cute .
Can I go in there now ?
I don't believe in luck .
I'm very excited .
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't having fun .
Tom ran barefoot on the beach .
Why did you get up so early ?
Tom needed to decide whether he would continue working in Boston .
Each of them has his own car .
Don't interrupt me again .
To drive a car , you need a license .
Turn it off .
I've been a lot worse .
We are hungry .
This kind of work makes me hungry .
Tom has a son and I do , too .
He spoke .
I just want you to know that I forgive you .
Tom is getting ready to go to work .
Tom didn't wash his hair .
I don't have vodka .
At first , I thought Tom was joking .
I haven't gone anywhere recently .
We miss you .
Are you watching the game ?
I still love you .
He is unmarried .
The meeting was canceled .
Tom will miss you .
Tom said that he didn't do it .
You've haven't paid me yet .
This is the first airplane to land at the new airport .
Why were you absent yesterday ?
We have to do it .
Mom , Tom pinched me .
A penguin is a bird that cannot fly .
Hasn't he looked at himself in a mirror ?
My sister's going to kill me .
The cat was curled up asleep .
She introduced her sister to him .
Walking along the street , I met an old friend .
I'm a citizen of the world .
What did Tom say this is ?
I want coffee , toast , and jelly .
We're almost out of soda .
No one can understand your letter .
I'm surprised to see you .
I wanted to see Tom again .
Tom has two sons . Both of them live in Boston .
You won't be on your own .
You're so late .
Don't let him do it by himself .
War suddenly broke out .
He was blue from the cold .
I don't know for sure .
Those are my cats .
I don't want Tom to go .
Be watchful .
Where did that ship come from ?
I hope this never happens again .
You look good in white .
I honestly think it's better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate .
Where is the notebook that I left here on the table yesterday ?
Tom has asked me not to do that anymore .
That's not important , is it ?
I'll be arriving at 2:30 .
I was hoping to surprise Tom .
You're good at that .
You like tennis , don't you ?
He may be a genius .
You'll get nothing .
This seems to be what we're looking for .
Do you study French at school ?
I don't like riding the subway .
Determination is everything .
Why is taking pictures of trains so interesting ?
Tom wasn't wearing sunglasses .
Just stay at home .
They all went to the restaurant .
Tom does that very rarely .
Today is election day in Poland .
May I have a glass of beer , please ?
I'm not angry .
It's pretty ugly .
What's the weather like this morning ?
I thought that Tom would find that interesting .
Aim . Fire !
Leave me .
I've been meaning to speak with you .
I want you to keep an eye on Tom .
Nothing would make me happier .
Tom's fever is getting worse .
I liked talking with Tom .
Is Tom still there ?
My brother and I are in the same class .
Can you make it go any faster ?
What do I owe you ?
Nobody warned me .
I can get us out of here .
When are we going back to Boston ?
That's easier said than done .
Tom's illiterate .
I like that one .
These are great .
How's this possible ?
I didn't know that Tom liked to play volleyball .
I had a bad night .
The Maori language is spoken in New Zealand .
Tom thinks that Mary won't say yes .
Nobody reads long messages .
It was already too late .
They set up a bronze statue of the hero .
Tom ended up winning .
What happened afterwards ?
I came to tell you that you don't need to worry .
These flowers are beautiful .
I think I've been brainwashed .
Tom won't likely be busy .
I never read that book .
He was the last person to arrive .
I will learn .
Can I borrow three hundred dollars from you ?
I'm glad you're glad .
I think it's better for Tom to stay here .
This is Tom's room .
Have you called an ambulance yet ?
Can you run as fast as Tom ?
He repeated his name slowly .
Tom plays the guitar almost as well as Mary does .
He wanted the taxi driver to turn left .
Do you want some help ?
So what did you think ?
Everybody was laughing .
You brought them here , didn't you ?
Let me tell you a secret .
Tom pinched my arm .
I will write to you next week .
The question was answered .
You work for me .
I'm feeling sick .
Did you see any planes today ?
It's not like I want you here .
Right now , we have to find out what happened .
Their confusion is understandable .
He's an aristocrat .
Tom helped with the dishes .
I'm a French teacher .
Come tomorrow morning .
I think he is from Australia , but I'm not sure .
I saw a man stealing clothes off my clothesline .
How did you know that I was going to ask you that question ?
It would be great if you visited your friends in Poland someday .
Mary is a very pretty girl .
I'm a little bit tired .
I wish you success in your work .
I just want to find out what happened .
Tom isn't going to the conference .
Are you enjoying it ?
Do you like to play computer games ?
I need to study math .
They married when they were young .
Tom is the captain of this baseball team .
Was everyone listening ?
You should do it .
There are lots of presents underneath the Christmas tree .
Prices depend on supply and demand .
We're going out .
I live next to a dam .
Who's the captain of this ship ?
Tom took off his coat because it was getting too hot to wear it .
Tom isn't immune , but Mary is .
If you are interested in studying English with a native speaker , please contact me .
Tom tried to break up the fight .
It's about time you were independent of your parents .
I am probably lost .
Don't ask .
I sincerely hope that you're vegan .
It is very kind of you to invite me to dinner .
This banana is rotten .
Tom is overjoyed .
How do I get to the zoo ?
Tom was rude to the waitress .
I'm just as scared as you are .
We're talking about you .
You forgot our wedding anniversary .
I just felt a drop of rain .
I don't want to talk about it now .
What if Tom doesn't agree ?
Tom is timid .
Why did you decide to sell your car ?
Tom is a Canadian who lives in Australia .
I'm feeling confident .
No news is good news .
Tom doesn't like talking to strangers .
I wonder why Tom has to do that .
Our air is polluted .
Is anybody going to eat this ?
Tom knew Mary was married .
She is loved by everyone .
You're an awesome teacher .
Tom was hiding behind a tree .
Tom owed Mary money .
Times have changed .
Does Tom still believe in magic ?
Tom is young , but he's pretty smart .
Tom is still in the classroom studying .
I was trying to help Tom .
Everyone arrived on time .
I missed you so much .
How long have you been teaching English ?
Try to understand it in Spanish , without translating to English .
I'm not sure I want you to see this .
Tom set the basket on the table .
We've run out of milk .
I have to hurry to the station to catch the last train .
Be kind to the children .
What's the Wi-Fi password ?
I didn't do it for you .
It's delicious .
Don't eat my fries .
We'll get this one .
We liked Tom .
I asked Tom to drop me off at the train station .
Hello , I'm Tom .
Is Tom still playing outside ?
He has to be in love with you .
I ran into Mary at a party last week .
Are you crazy ?
I guess I could use some advice .
Tom is the only one crying .
Is that really allowed ?
I hope Tom sees this .
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting .
France is in western Europe .
Is this book Tom's ?
Tom said he had plenty of friends in Boston .
I couldn't come because it rained .
You had it right the first time .
Wouldn't you like to know ?

I don't think Tom has ever been to Boston .
Tom heard a gunshot just as he was opening the door .
Are you calling me a coward ?
One of the bulls pushed the fence down .
Tom took the orange juice out of the refrigerator .
Remind me to never do that again .
I wanted to make sure it wasn't us who caused the problem .
I'm taking you with me .
Tom was the only one that got arrested .
How many close friends do you have ?
Go ahead , open it .
Nobody talks about Tom anymore .
We told Tom not to stay out late .
Tom told me he wasn't sure .
Tom may not be hungry .
We were relaxing .
I've already finished it .
You're a big help .
Tom works as a security guard .
I'd like to go skiing .
It was Tom .
I'm getting worse .
I think that that's all very important .
I don't know exactly what the problem is .
Tom is too tired to help Mary do that today .
The names are sorted alphabetically .
What do we have to lose ?
You'll do fine .
Tom called the bank .
You'll have a rough time .
Tom works from nine to five .
We're tired of waiting .
Always tell the truth .

I can eat insects .
Did you go to Tom's funeral ?
He doesn't like to wait until the last moment to do something .
You don't need to think about that now .
"I can't do everything you've asked me to do" . "Then just do what you can" .
Tom is sometimes disrespectful , but Mary isn't .
Where can I get tickets ?
The atomic bomb destroyed the entire city of Hiroshima .
I'll look around .
They were both naked .
Tom is ready to work .
No one knows that .
How did the police find out ?
Could we speak to you ?
Too many cooks spoil the broth .
I'm not sure that Tom should do that again .
I won't eat here again .
Tom is from Australia , isn't he ?
Where are you from ?
He's not a hero .
I didn't wait for Tom .
I think that Tom would've disagreed .
Mom bought a pretty doll for me .
Tom woke up the next day feeling better .
Don't stay home all day .
I wish you had told me the truth .
Tom is good at diving .

I rarely catch a cold .
Who do you think is cuter , Mary or Alice ?
Tom wanted to know what had happened .
I don't think Tom needs to do that today .
What's your favorite Johnny Depp movie ?
I don't think I'll make it .
They aren't mine .
I love this album .
Is Tom doing okay ?
I'm sure Tom will be sympathetic .

Please think before speaking .
All the food was gone .
You wouldn't happen to know where she lives , would you ?
What do you think now ?
Tom really needs our help .
This house is haunted .

Tom hung the ornaments on the Christmas tree .
Your passport , please .

I don't think he has anything to do with the matter .
Are you going to go there ?

Who taught you how to swim ?
Are you sure we have to be there by 2:30 ?
I still haven't done that yet .
Make sure you tell Tom .
Why should Tom apologize ?
I don't really expect Tom to win .
Could you move forward so we can close the door ?
Tom is going to have to do that .
Our restaurant is better than that restaurant .
You should tell Tom that Mary is planning to join the team .
I used to be fat .
You have to be honest .
You can't count on his help .
Tom and Mary are carpenters .
Tom opened the doors .

She is a hysterical woman .

Is that briefcase Tom's ?
He's open-minded .
I made you coffee .
He asked her seven times to marry him .
I caught a beautiful butterfly .
You need to speak more clearly .
How far is Boston from here ?

How'd you find it ?
What do those lights signify ?
They say Tom is gone .

Can you forget your native language ?
I don't want to be a burden to you .
I don't have much faith in his ability .
I'm a little worried about Tom .
I'm sure I'll regret this .
There is one problem .
Can rabbits swim ?
These ideas are embodied in the constitution .
I don't think that Tom is concerned .
You're unbelievable .
I completely gave up .
I used to play alone when I was a child .
There won't be so many people there .
Can Tom do that ?
Can we talk about this later ?
Tom is very tall .
Why won't you tell me ?
Tom suggested that we postpone the meeting .
You'll find somebody .
I know that look .
I understand that sooner or later Tom will want to do that .
What were you expecting ?
Do you want me to go ?
I was born on the twenty-second of June in 1974 .
That would fix the problem .
We tried to persuade him .
We met them at the youth hostel .
What are you drinking ?
They're not sure .
Have a nice weekend .

Are you flirting with me ?
Tom wants to relax .
Tom is so much younger than Mary .
Goodnight , I'll see you in the morning .
His life is hanging by a thread .

You do know I can't do that , don't you ?

Tom has a scar on his face .
Whatever makes you happy makes me happy .
It looks like rain .
I'm just a little confused .
We got out of bed early on Christmas morning .
Wait for a few seconds .
Tom didn't seem tired tonight .
We don't want to pressure you .
You saw what happened , didn't you ?
They couldn't stop laughing .
I can't imagine what Tom is feeling now .
I want to know how much it's going to cost me to go to Australia with you .
"Will he come home soon" ? "I'm afraid not" .
I stopped to ask Tom why .
You recognize her , don't you ?
We've got plenty of time .
Don't you have a TV ?
I'm testing it now .
How much do you want ?
This CD costs ten dollars .
I don't know what Tom did yesterday .
It was fabulous .

Get away from me .

I play tennis every day .
The number of stars in the sky is infinite .
Tom studied medicine in Boston .
Tom didn't do what he said he was going to do .

I'd never betray you .
Let's lie on the sand .
Tom is sincere , isn't he ?
I enjoy watching soccer on TV .
I'll be in Boston for three days .
Tom said he didn't need a lawyer .
I'm right-handed .
Tom was walking down the street .
Tom is sending Mary a message .
I asked where to go .
I think that I can do that again .
I forgot to call her last night .
Please eat some cake .
It's very stuffy in here .
Tom isn't the one who suggested that .
Tom would've eaten more if he hadn't been sick .
Why did you do that ?
Are you listening ?
I'm being sincere when I say that I love you .
I know everything about you .
I think that it was strange that Tom didn't say anything .
I'm the one with the car .
I like sleeping .
All that you have to do is to follow his advice .
My home is my castle .
I'm not the one who paid the bill .
Who became the new director ?
Tom will save us .
Diligence is essential to success in life .
What's the new teacher like ?
That's why I'm late .
Tom is a wolf in sheep's clothing .
I hope Tom stands firm on that issue .
I hurt my left arm .
I'd like a sandwich , please .
I can't stand people like you .
How old is your brother ?
Although she is rich , she dresses quite simply .
I know both of them .
My gums are swollen .
Tom apologized to the audience .
I've lost my watch .
I spend a few hours a day maintaining my website .

I don't want to see you again .
I'll wait here till he comes back .
I don't like horror movies .
Tom snores loudly .
Nobody says you can't go fishing .
Do you remember the name of your first French teacher ?
Let me know when you hear from Tom .
Why doesn't Tom like me ?
He is about my age .
You told me to do that .
I had to get a molar extracted .
We got robbed .
He kept me waiting .
We'll need to talk to Tom .
I'm watching TV now .
If you listen closely enough you'll be able to hear it .
Give me the map .
I need one more .
I can't stop her .
He will be busy tomorrow .
He loves them .
Tom told me Mary was tired .
You can drive a car , can't you ?
Tom is out , but Mary is at home .
You need a lawyer .
President Hoover tried to solve the crisis .
We need that woman's name .
I hardly ever throw food away .
I don't know what you do .
Let's synchronize our watches .
Who are you thinking about ?
Tom is still talking to Mary .
Your support means a great deal to me .
Why didn't you say goodbye ?
What did you buy at the supermarket ?
We will see whether he will recognize me or not .
We have no time to waste .
Tom has a headache .
Tom said that a woman answered the phone .
I have abandoned the idea of buying a house .
In case of emergency , call 119 .
I want to stay as long as I can .
Common causes of stress are work and human relationships .
Get up .
I don't know why you want me to do this .
Tom injured his elbow when he fell .
I don't do that .
Are the arrangements for your trip complete ?
Why don't you get a job ?
They fight like cat and dog .
The man who was smoking said , "He doesn't come here any more" .
Must I write in ink ?
How is the weather in Boston ?
I'm not ashamed of what I did .
I do not understand her .
Tom filled Mary's wine glass to the rim .
Tom knows you're a Canadian .
I met him at the station .
We need more doctors like you .
You're going to be fine .
My father made me wash the car .
Karaoke is good for reducing stress .
We're going to stay at home today .
Don't carry more money than you need .
You can't go where I'm going .
I couldn't prove my theory .
How did Tom die ?
I am a boy .
We play chess every evening .
I'm not going to do anything about it .
Disneyland was built in 1955 .
If you think that this is going to be easy , you're wrong .

Are you hiding ?
My eyes hurt .
Do you want it ?
Solve this problem on your own .

I won't be able to visit you tomorrow because I'll be busy .
Stay cool .
He jimmied the lock .
You're taunting me .
Who helps your mother ?
The phone rang for a long time .
Tom began talking immediately .
They believe it .
What time do you usually have lunch ?
Tom was eventually convicted .
This is my house .
The printer broke down .
You have an hour .
I , too , would like to know .
Do you see that house ? That's my house .
I feel safer now .
He threatened me , but I didn't get scared .
Didn't you know Tom liked Mary ?
I hope you've enjoyed yourselves .
I swear it's the last time .
I got stabbed .
He is nervous about it .
Let me get you some tea .
I'm happy Tom managed to change his name .
I've already finished reading this book .
Tom doesn't have to leave tomorrow morning .
I think what Tom did was intentional .
Is this water OK to drink ?
Do we have to get up early tomorrow morning ?
I hate quarreling .
We were having so much fun that we lost track of time .
You're on my side , aren't you ?
We can't stop it .
Tom succumbed to the temptation .
Look , Tom , I'm sorry that I hurt you .
Don't walk so fast .
Both of them were not present at the meeting .
What a loser !
I don't even have a car anymore .
I'll get fired if I don't do that .
Bad news travels fast .
Did you go to see Tom ?
Is it worth something ?
Why don't we order pizza ?
I want you to think about this again .
I don't know if that means anything .
I was out of town on vacation .

The sea gulls are flying low .
Black and white photos have a special charm .
Can you help me solve a mystery ?
Why are you wearing my shoes ?
It was partly my fault .
What's that got to do with you ?
Please explain the rules to me .
Are you two busy right now ?
Tom is a very smart guy .
I'm so happy .
It looks like rain .
They went fishing .
We'll have lived here for two years next April .
Tom comes here practically every day .
I came to like him .
Tom will make it .
He gave the cat milk .
Who are you talking with ?
Tom has almost everything a boy could want .
No one knows where Tom is .

He died recently .
What are you doing tonight ?
Be objective .
Why didn't you go with your mother ?
Let me have a look at those photos .
We know him .
Tom has more money than brains .
Did you learn that from Tom ?
Tom is a ballet dancer .
You are my mother .
I couldn't be more disappointed .
You're quite forgetful , aren't you ?
We have lots of snow in the winter .
May I speak frankly ?
I didn't know where to hide .
Tom is a hard person to please .
Does your wife work ?
I'm learning so much from you .

You should work more .
Tom said he didn't understand anything .
Tom is a terrible father .

I'll finish it in one hour .
There are only two correct answers .
We're still in the initial stage .
I've never heard her speak ill of others .

My friend lives in this house .
It is bad to steal .
It's very rare for that to happen .
Do you want to see something funny ?
There's something I need to tell you before you leave .
Do you think that we'll get there on time ?
I asked Tom to tell the truth .
This conference room is too small .
Bread and milk are good foods .

We can get a beautiful view of the sea from the hill .
I don't want you to know my real name .

Don't be so unkind .
Listening to a language being spoken is very different from reading or writing the same language .
Tom is a good husband .
Do you know how to count to ten in French ?

I think it won't rain tomorrow .
It's strange that no one knows the victim .
Tom needs no introduction .
I had no choice but to take the plane .
Tom will do this .
We appreciate your kind advice .
It isn't hard to do .

I was sent home .
I didn't have to study yesterday .
I wonder whether you understand .
About how many hours do you sleep every night ?
I'm not good at French .
Many of the people in the crowd were wearing masks .
You have to try to stay awake .
It won't change a thing .
Please accept my condolences .
I'm going to close the door now .
My grandfather was an archaeologist .
He will survive .
This is a road map .
Thanks for your help .
I didn't know that Tom used to be a policeman .
Why did I trust you ?
You're honest .
I doubt very seriously that will scare Tom .
How can I get there ?
Thanks for being so tolerant .
Did anybody tell you what's going on ?
That's not possible .
Peace is on the horizon .
I don't get it .
You have to wait in line .
It isn't the same thing .
I want to lose weight .
Our teacher seemed surprised .
He combed back his hair .
We're proud of Tom .
Talk to my attorney .
In the year 2012 , there will be flying cars everywhere .
Does it snow much in your country ?
Tom can't stand being interrupted .
We stayed at home all day .
Ask Tom what to do next .
I don't like going to bed early .
I want to pretend it never happened .
The more you know about him , the more you like him .
You've betrayed us .
Are you sure you don't want to stay for dinner ?
Tom no longer wants to go to Boston .
Tom picked Mary up .
I'd like to live in a decent house .

Tom and I got married in Boston three years ago .
This was Tom's chair .
Is that a good or a bad thing ?

Who are you afraid of ?
We love this school .

May I ask you a favor ?
Could you guys help me ?
The movie was a lot better than I expected it to be .
I baked a loaf of bread .
I like you a lot .
I haven't ever studied French .
That doesn't solve the problem .
There's no evidence Tom did that .
I wonder whether Tom knows how to play the flute or not .
Turn right there .

You are in love with him .

That's the last thing I want to do .
Where do you have pain ?
Why don't you ask Tom ?
Millions of farmers had to look for other work .
I like studying French .
He asked her why she was crying .
We both know what'll happen if we don't do what we're supposed to do .
You have lots of friends .
Cancel all my appointments .
You should've warned me .
Tom was born on a plane .
You've got to carry a gun in this area .
We just ate dinner .
When can we see each other again ?
This tape recorder is not new .
It looks very expensive .
I am all but ready .
I'm still trying to convince Tom to help us .
Remember to flush the toilet .
I've never felt this way before .
We just have to keep winning .
That's not a cat . It's a dog .
Let me stay here with you .
Tom didn't seem to understand what you were saying .
Who got married ?
I think it's time for me to get my own place .
Your help is necessary to our success .
I work at the airport .
She suggested that I take him to the zoo .
Someone is lying .
That kind of story appeals to me .
I promised Tom that I wouldn't cry .
In August , I'm going to Japan with my friends .
I could actually have broken a leg .
Listen to the music .
You are my prisoner .
Who's the composer of this symphony ?
Is there anyone in the room ?
Was Tom on drugs ?
Do you know how to play mahjong ?
I woke up with a sore throat .
She didn't take many photos .
Are you alone ?
That's why I was absent from school yesterday .
This writer is Russian .
We heard a gunshot .
Tom could get hurt if he does that .
I know people .
I must buy some milk .
Does it taste good ?
Can you do it by yourself ?
I'm happy you came .
I don't think that Tom knows I'm a vegetarian .
He was standing at the gate .
What caused the crash ?
I'd rather study French with a native French speaker .
I need a driver to take me home .
Is it true that Tom used to live in Boston ?
I didn't know you were planning on doing that .
Have you ever studied archeology ?
You like doing that , don't you ?
I didn't take very many pictures .
When I got home , I found I had lost my wallet .
I still have some doubts .
Hang in there .
Be careful not to make a mess .
The explanation is clear .
Lots of women both run a home and go out to work .
Let's get off the bus .
I can't tell you what Tom told me .
I think it's doable .
I'm getting a lot of complaints .
Which one will you choose ?
You only die once .
I quit smoking a year ago .
I can't believe Tom would just give up .
I don't want the same thing to happen to us .
Why are you so pessimistic ?
He has been speaking for an hour .
I was asked to show my passport at the border .
This is offensive .
You can't be my teacher .
Our kids hate us .
Where is the school ?
You're so selfish .
The Italian food was delicious .
You always talk too much .
How did they manage that ?
Set the alarm clock for seven o'clock .
Sorry , I was busy .
Can you really do it ?
Which one was your favorite ?
Tom refused to sign the contract .
I want to ask you a question .
It's hard to stop smoking .
We want to leave .
Tom is very angry with Mary .
Will it matter if I do that ?
Shouting isn't singing .
You could've gone .
Would three o'clock be all right ?
Do you think Tom would know how to fix this ?
Tom is still having doubts .
I hate working .
I hope you're happy .
Canada has a cold climate .
Stop here .
Where did you buy this coffee ?
They're foreigners .
Don't eat before going to bed .
I've explained all that .
I think they were all fired .
Not everyone is honest .
My mom works in a factory .
Tom didn't want to go to Boston with Mary .
I am a shy boy .
It's a beautiful story .
This concerns you .
Tom painted the doors blue .
Who were you there with ?
She forgave him for losing all her money .
This song sounds sad .
Is this about me ?
Tom still doesn't know what to do .
You'll get fired .
Are you the one who saved me ?
Tom travels around the world playing concerts .
I cut a branch from the tree .
Los Angeles is the second largest city in the United States .
You're behaving like a spoilt brat .
Tom is convinced Mary stole his clarinet .
I wasn't sure that you'd like that .
She couldn't utter a word .
Are you children all right ?
I haven't eaten or drunk anything since yesterday morning .
I'd like to have a glass of water .
Don't interrupt me ! Can't you see I am talking ?
They visited us .
You should've come with us .
I do not have a cat .
Look , I want you to do me a favor .
I'm sorry , but you've got to go .
Tom did something crazy .
We want a new carpet .
Nobody knows that you're my cousin .
I don't want Tom going to your office .
This is the most beautiful country I have ever visited .
What did Tom's house look like ?
Is there a supermarket near here ?
It's good exercise to climb hills .
Go , before I change my mind .
I know I should've gotten here earlier .
Hopefully , everything will be OK .
I've given my best for the company .
Mary is the prettier of the two .
He didn't go to school .
I hope that you're not planning on doing that .
I just can't believe that really happened .
I'm getting used to this .
Tom didn't have to wear a suit and tie , but he did .
Tom reminds me of his father .
He is not what he seems .
When did you start studying French ?
They're strong .
I don't know a whole lot about fishing .
Give me Tom's phone number and I'll call him .
Your advice has always been very helpful to me .
I'm sick of drinking apple juice .
That's a lot of food .
You look like you're in pain .
What did Tom forget ?
She loves coffee .
Tom wanted a new car .
I hardly know you .
It'll be forgotten in a few months' time .
Tom is playing .
I was wondering if there is any way you could deliver that today .
I didn't expect it .
This is Tom's handwriting .
Do you want to leave it like that ?
Tom wouldn't go back to Australia if he didn't need to .
I think they'll win .
They visited me occasionally .
Some women are very dangerous .
They kept him waiting outside for a long time .
Does Tom dye his hair ?
He's my younger brother .
I can't help you until Monday .
Tom and I weren't completely alone .
His new book will appear next month .
Do you know anyone who's not on Facebook ?
The peace treaty will be signed tomorrow .
I've decided to tell on Tom .
The sand was so hot that it burned our feet .
I know that isn't Tom's signature .
Hang on tight !
Tom has many friends who can speak French .
He was eager for news .
Are you Tom's friend ?
The prisoner was set free yesterday .
Your mother would be proud of you .
He was afraid of his wife .
I'm going to talk to them .
Have you been away ?
When did you learn to do that ?
Are you for or against the plan ?
Tom is at the top of his French class .
I love your accent .
His higher salary allows him to live comfortably .
I think I'd better stay here .
We have to start over again .
The waiter spit in the soup .
You didn't eat that , did you ?
Tom is thorough .
He went there to learn English .
Tom wasn't in love with Mary . He was in love with Alice .
Tom asked me what the problem was .
He said he did not know the man , which was a lie .
What're you thinking ?
I moved here three years ago .
What am I supposed to do with this money ?
Am I going to be OK ?
Some diseases are incurable .
We don't like Tom's dog .
Tom and Mary are both good students .
Tom thought Mary was wasting her time studying French .
I don't want to be in your way .
Have you seen any movies lately ?
Isn't that sad ?
I'm surprised it hasn't happened sooner .
He can be counted on .
I just hate when that happens .
I think both Tom and Mary are lying .
Things change over time .
Tom hasn't brushed his teeth yet .
He told me about the accident as if he had seen it with his own eyes .
They accused me of having broken my promise .
She invited me to her birthday party .
I never tried to do that again .
Tom and Mary are very interested .
I wish you weren't so far away .
Are you up there ?
Have you called the boss already ?
They are both colleagues of mine .
I wonder if Tom will call me .
You spend too much time with him .
We have to keep going .
The snow was knee deep .
They don't want you .
Tom doesn't think before he speaks .
I think of you all the time .
We're running out of water .
Tom came to see us yesterday afternoon .
Tom is the one who showed me how to do it .
I'm just trying to do the right thing .
Tom is planning to meet Mary at the airport .
I don't know why Tom didn't want me to do that .
Did you close the window ?
You have bad manners .
The dog is jumping .
What kind of ship is that ?
I'm angry at you .
You're not allowed to park around here .
Tom tried to cheer Mary up , but she kept on crying .
I can only see it getting worse .
We want to talk about it .
Your way of doing things will have an effect on your future .
All were present .
Are they coming as well ?
I don't know anyone named Tom .
Tom didn't want Mary to know .
Tom wanted to be a doctor .
Keep them .
Give me that bottle .
Can I help you clean up ?
Did you know Tom was a vegetarian ?
Tom liked to swim when he was younger .
I hope that she'll get well soon .
Elephants don't eat meat .
I think his life is in danger .
Tom jumped over a ditch .
I have to do it now .
My father took out his wallet and gave me ten dollars .
Just be sensitive .
I'm not going to go to Boston with Tom .
I want to be as happy as Tom .
Tom didn't answer all the questions .
I was scared , too .
I think that I see something .
Tom wasn't home alone .
We played on the same soccer team .
That's what I want to do .
I wasn't having as much fun as Tom was .
I thought we were going to win .
We have different color eyes .
I was just nervous .
I think it was Tom who volunteered to do that .
Your opinion is important to me .
Do you like Tom ?
I was once like you .
When I got up to go to school , the moon was still visible in the sky .
We don't know .
You are free to go or stay .
I bet I know what's wrong .
Who are you and what do you want ?
I'm an Aquarius .
Tom is paid to do that , isn't he ?
Are you off duty tonight ?
I'm willing to do anything you ask me .
Tom wasn't aware of what was going on .
Tom takes very good care of his car .
Watch this .
Did you wait ?
I wonder how Tom got away .
I don't like it .
May I help you find something ?
You know who we are , don't you ?
Do you have any milk ?
I do not understand .
I'm not calling Tom .
Is the castle open today ?
I want to win .
I know it's terrible .
I feel just fine .
Did you spend Christmas with Tom ?
A drunk man's words are a sober man's thoughts .
I know that Tom can do that again .
Tom is wearing a black hat today .
Tom is old enough to drink .
He as well as you is tired of this work .
I want to know now .
Tom is afraid of the dark .
Breakfast is at half past nine .
I don't have kids .
Don't ask me if I'm happy .
Tom's unconscious .
You don't have to say anything you don't want to say .
This is so stupid .
What happens if Tom doesn't pass ?
Can you tell me what this says ?
Please wait thirty minutes .
Is Tom still living in Boston ?
She leaves for New York next Sunday .
Store in a cool and dry place .
You must pay attention to him .
I'll take them to Tom .
They went there .
How many dozen pencils do you have ?
I bought a ticket .
I think it's time for me to spend a little time with my children .
He will survive .
Tom is going to talk to Mary .
Why does he want to join the army ?
I wasn't aware of what Tom had done .
I have nothing more to say .
Tom isn't eating .
They adapted themselves to the change quickly .
We don't have to do this now .
Tell me where she lives .
It's up to you to decide .
We were all rooting for you .
See that the door is locked before you leave .
I'll be in my study .
Love is not a crime .
Tom is younger than your daughter .
If I pay you a dollar , we'll be even .
Where can I buy silk ?
We had to let Tom go .
Please at least think about it .
I think Tom is afraid .
I couldn't believe Tom did that .
Time flies .
I have no fever .
Get out .
There are a lot of French books in the library .
We came here to buy headphones .
I want to rent a car .
She doesn't seem to be an American .
When will that new school open ?
Were you thinking about me ?
I was thirteen years old then .
The door won't close .
Tom said that I looked uncomfortable .
Their business is expanding .
Tom said that he wants to go .
I need advice .
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship .
Get me my glasses .
How are things ?
Tom walked home .
My father didn't say anything .
You should ask Tom first .
We need to get this done before we can go home .
That's so cute .
Tom opened the cage and let the monkey out .
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger .
I'm afraid that I have some bad news .
Tom is a professor of Chinese literature .
I swear I don't know anything .
As long as you live in my house , you'll follow my rules .
Nobody asked for your opinion .
You should ask Tom about all of this .
The discount is included in the price .
They can't stop us .
That game was awesome .
You don't want that , do you ?
Do you think that anybody would care if we did that ?
I didn't want my mom to know .
That is rather unexpected .
Tom commutes to school by train .
Tom asked Mary if she trusted John .
Tom is always asking me for money .
All of my things are gone .
You're a beautiful young woman .

That's what I saw .
I came upon an old friend of mine on the train .
That's something special .
How far away do you think that ship is ?
You're replaceable .
I told him what to do , but he wouldn't listen .
Who's that boy ?
Tom and Mary were staring at each other .
Do you think Tom is still suspicious ?
Tom isn't an athlete .
The best way to predict the future is to invent it .
Tom was my neighbor three years ago .
His name is Tom , not John .
Forget it .
None of this makes any sense .
Tom , I want to hear it from you .
I entered Tom's room .
Their house is being remodeled .
Tom is here with me .
Have you been thinking about me ?
Do you know French ?
He is Japanese .
Is it still snowing ?
I freely admit that I'm not the world expert in childrearing .
I bought him a tie .
It's completely dark .
He showed me his new car .
Let me tell you something else .
What's your address ?
Tom talked to Mary almost every day .
It really gets on my nerves .
I'm 25 years old .
Are there any famous musicians on the stage ?
He has money , but he's not happy .
I want to go to the lake .
Everyone went there , didn't they ?
We were sitting peacefully at dinner , when all of a sudden the lights went out .
We won the battle .
I hate it when Tom does this .

We're from the same neighborhood .
I talked on the phone .

Tom is going to move back to Boston .
He's really angry .
I spent the day with Tom .
I'd like to have your answer right away .

I'd rather be at home .
That happened decades ago .
I was assaulted .
Who's gonna be there ?
Tom doesn't like to ask for help from people he doesn't know .
I'm from Boston .
I should've eaten more .
Why are you being so mean to me ?
I stayed home all day instead of going to work .
Tom threw the dice .
Get changed .
Shut it down .
We can't choose who our parents are .
Tom can make himself understood in French .
May I visit your office tomorrow morning ?
Tom dressed up as a pirate .
They have families .
Tom was sent back to Boston .
What would you do , if you lost your job ?
Tom said that he's always been interested in sports .
I'd like to see Tom , please .
I don't know where Tom goes to school .
Can't we fire Tom ?
I don't feel much like talking right now .
What's new ?
A little mischief can be a good thing .
I have at least ten books .
I swear I'll always protect you .
Tom wrote a book while he was in Australia .
Why don't you answer ?
No one owes me anything .
Read the instructions carefully .
We should've stayed home with Tom .
Why do you want to commit suicide ?
Tom held his breath and waited .
He drove a nail into the board .
It's a fake .
I promise that it won't happen again .
I'm not good at anything .
Tom said he doesn't think Mary needs to do that .
I lent Tom my car last week .
I'd love to know if my luggage is arriving soon .
Tom is the one we want .
Tom and I were alone .
What else do you want from me ?
Tom still lives in the same house that his parents bought when he was three years old .
Hey , I may have no money , but I still have my pride .
I need to talk to one of you .

It is one thing to make a plan and quite another to carry it out .
Can I get Tom to do it ?

They're family .
I don't like this one .

Guess what Tom bought .
Today is the tomorrow we worried about yesterday .

I don't know what to say .
I hate doing this stuff .

Don't forget me .
The nation ceased to exist .
I sat back down at my computer .
I won't bother you again .
How can I lose ?
I heard the doorknob jiggle .

I was aware of that fact .

You may use my bicycle if you want to .
That's unreasonable .

I don't think that that's going to work .
Tom doesn't want to eat .
Tom wanted to become a diplomat .

I was impressed .
Just for the record , I totally disagree with this decision .
Tom doesn't have to let me go .

It'll snow tomorrow .
Tom and I like to sit on the porch after dinner .

I am going to miss you .
My car broke down , so I had to take a bus .
I haven't had this much fun in a long time .
I know we can do that .
Which sports do you like ?
I guess that doesn't make sense .
In English the verb precedes the object .
I'll get up early tomorrow .
Is there a bank near the station ?
Please be careful not to break this vase .
Do you know those men ?
What went wrong ?
Are you athletic ?
That's not something that you forget .
I've never had one of those .
Give me back my pencil .
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't walk alone after dark .
We should keep ourselves clean .
It's much more expensive to eat out than to eat at home .
I want to know why .
Tom is a biologist .
"I met the new teacher" . "What's he like" ?
Many young people were present at the party .
She really takes after her mother .
The blade was very sharp .
I think we should attack immediately .
It's what I want .
It's a luxury we can't afford .
Does that work ?
I find this kind of work very tedious .
Tom is likely to still be suspicious .
You can't show this video to anyone .
What's Tom going to do ?
There is another option .
Tom has almost no income .
Tom isn't in his seat .
We need fresh ideas .
The mood in the courtroom was tense .
I think that we'll always be here .
I started learning Chinese last week .
The new telescope was shipped in a huge wooden box .
She's already forgotten about you .
I love teaching children French .
I am driving a truck .
I wasn't on time for school this morning .
Do you think that listening to music while you study is beneficial ?
Who else do you know in Boston ?
I wonder if he enjoyed the last match .

I have to leave earlier today than usual .
Do you see anybody ?
What's your favorite action movie ?
I've known Tom since I was little .
Tom picked Mary up on his way home .
Let me use your computer .
You haven't told me your name .
Children like to pretend to be adults when they play .
They're Tom's .
Do you want this back ?
German is the best language in the world .
Hold this ladder steady .
I should've seen that coming .
I do want it .
You bought an expensive coat , didn't you ?
I will have some vacation days .

I feel bad for him .
Do you enjoy living like this ?
You're hiding something .
If you call me ahead of time , I'll be ready .
The teacher approved his plan .
Did you enjoy the game ?
When do you plan to visit Tom ?
As soon as she saw me , she started to cry .
It wasn't where Tom said it would be .
Tom divorced Mary last year .
You're absolutely right .
We just don't believe it .
You'd better come .
I didn't fall asleep .
I can speak French a little .
It's too ugly .
It's getting colder and colder .
I didn't flirt with Mary .
Tom didn't want a wife .
Schools will be closed today due to the weather .
The jury acquitted him of the crime .
Did you find out where Tom goes to school ?
I want to practice with you .
I can't talk now .
My bed is more comfortable than yours .
I was playing the violin .
I have not eaten breakfast yet .
You should get some exercise .
You're taunting me .
Be careful what you tell children . They'll believe anything .
We did that as a publicity stunt .
Why are you sorry for something you haven't done ?
I changed my mind .
Tom quickly fell asleep .
I'm asking your opinion .
I think Tom and Mary are Canadians .
We want to work with them .
Think before you speak .
The day was hot .
Have you already paid ?
Tom counted the money two times .
Her house is at the foot of the mountain .
Listen ! She is going to explain that rule again .
Tom stutters .
He is twice as old as she is .
I'm so tired that I'm going to bed as soon as I get home .
We're going to be OK .
I'll do it now .
Tom didn't have enough experience in dealing with that kind of problem .
I do that a lot .
Tom ate all the bacon .
Tom probably thought Mary was going to want to do that today .
Tom gave some very sound advice .
I can't help doubting his honesty .
I must go to the station at three o'clock .
Do you plan to rent a car ?
Don't give Tom what he's asking for .
Can I help you do something ?
I didn't notice what Tom was eating .
Tom is in a panic .
The cat is snoring in my lap .
Tom is desperate to win .
Please be honest .
Tom barely recognized Mary .
May I ask you a favor ?
Everybody was wearing a mask .
I love traveling .
Is Tom staying at the Hilton Hotel ?
Are you kidding me ?
The Soviet Union launched Sputnik I in 1957 .
They said they never saw Tom .
Is Spanish spoken in Mexico ?
I can't look at this anymore .
You're beautiful , you know ?
If I'd wanted your opinion , I would've asked for it .
Where are the apples ?
I waited all day for somebody to come and help me .
The cat is sitting on the table .
Maybe it's not fair .
I want to become a journalist .
I should've done this a long time ago .
Why is Tom wearing a coat ?
You were a big help tonight .
I enjoyed playing tennis over the weekend .
Pleased to meet you .
Duty calls .
I didn't think it was real .
I'm in town on business .
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't live in Boston anymore .
All of my friends can speak French .
My eyes were tired .
I'm doing okay .
I think that's very bizarre .
He broke up the concrete block with a hammer .
I didn't know Tom was sleeping .
These are Tom's .
Come and see me anytime you want to .
Tom is looking at the map .
You remembered that a little too late .
Don't let that dog go .
She always cared about my health .
They are sitting at the table .
She spends a lot of time helping her children learn to deal with money .
I was stung by a bee .

I know you're hungry .
I'm sure he'll pass the next exam .
There's something I have to do .
Tom and Mary were also in the room .
I wonder if Tom realizes how many hours a day I work .
Guess who this letter's from .
Tom's hair is curly .
Tom and I got along fairly well .
Tom slowly drew back .
Please tell me you're joking .
Have you brought me what you said you would ?
There's a catch .
Tom is eager to go to Boston .
I need to remember to tell Tom to do that .
You'd better check that .
I'm cutting down on sweets .
Tom said he was in a hurry .
This is what I have to do .
I don't like this episode .
It could be a huge opportunity .
Now I understand .
I wish I'd helped Tom at the time .
If you didn't have him to exchange letters with , you would be lonely .
Tom hid behind the tree .
Tom was the last to arrive .
I know who the killer is .
Let's do that first .
Tom wrote a story about that .
I think I'll always love you .
We will never agree .
I want to know why you were absent yesterday .
Tom gave Mary a key to his apartment .
How do you like your new apartment ?
It is on the left side of the street .
It's hard to imagine a life without pets .
Tom is being blackmailed by Mary .
Tom let Mary pay the bill .
You're cute .
Is it true Tom won the race ?
I don't know how it happened . It just happened .
Do you know whether Tom did that or not ?
Are you able to do that ?
I would like to meet you .
Tom ran out of food .
My mom worries all the time .
I'm trying .
We threw it away .
Tom seemed to like Australia .
The bus should be here in thirty minutes .
I love my job .
My son is going to leave for France next week .
I usually get home by six o'clock .
Tom didn't stay out for long .
I'm sure it wasn't me who did that .
She forgot to write him .
Watch carefully .
Have you ever seen Tom angry ?
I have many enemies .
The job has already been done .
I don't like to be judged .
I don't know what I'm going to do with my cat now that I'm moving to another country .
Tom has really taught me many things .
You've never done that , have you ?
Tom and Mary chatted about the weather .
That's how I do everything .
I have to leave early today .
That didn't work out very well .
You'll never know unless you try .
I'm not going to say no .
Did you buy Tom a dog ?
Can't you just fix it ?
I'm going to study French for one semester .
Tom got tired of waiting .
I don't have it .
Try it without sauce .
You're going to miss me .
This is everything that we'd hoped for .
She turned down our offer of help .
You can't fire us .
Why are we laughing ?
Does anyone here speak French ?
Are you sure you aren't cold ?
I know you better than your wife does .
Vaccinations help prevent childhood diseases .
Tom can't play tennis .
She lives with him .
I didn't know you were dating .
He is my colleague .
I'm beautiful .
I'd like to kiss you .
There's no need to be embarrassed .
I can't walk another step .
Cut it into two pieces .
I think you need to go home now .
Tom foolishly dove into shallow water .
That's a copy .
You've let me down .
You have no idea what this is , do you ?
Do you think Tom saw me ?
Tom said he grew up in Boston .
He never tells lies .
What are friends for ?
We know what happened last weekend .
I met a dog on my way home .
I've been captured .
I won the lottery .
We're not perfect , but we try to be .
Tom wants to be like me .
We were very disappointed with the results .
There is no doubt .
Which bag is yours ?
Tom drove Mary home in his sports car .
They applauded .
Do you know how much Tom paid for that ?
I had no idea who she was .
I already know who you are .
You don't need to stay if you don't want to .
I am planting beans in my garden .
I don't like it when you bring work home .
She asked him for some money to buy a new dress .
Do whatever needs to be done .
I thought I might be able to help .
He is said to be a genius .
I'm going to sleep here .
Tom recognized me .
I want to rent this room to a student .
Continue working .
There isn't anyone in the room .
Tell us a story .
I'm not afraid of spiders anymore .
Tom doesn't have any friends in Boston .
I hope you've learned something from your mistake .
I just wanted to go home .
I won't let anything stand in my way .
I'm happy enough .
I'm not interested in learning French .
"Are you still mad at me" ? "No , not at all" .
Tom may not want to go to Boston with you .
I'm getting hungry .
It would be better to stay at home .
Tom must've taken the wrong train .
I think that I'm ready to go .
This video is boring .
It would take too long to explain to you .
Do you love me ?
It's a shame Tom didn't know .
I suppose that you did it yourself .
Is that unconstitutional ?
Tom didn't want to be a teacher .
Newscasters blink a lot .
I wrote this book .
Where's the bathroom ?
After they argued , they didn't speak to each other for a week .
My kid was in the car .
That was so amazing .
I need to ask you a silly question .
I looked for the key .
Do you want me to call Tom ?
I will pay for it by check .
I'm thirty years older than you .
We went to a restaurant .
I tore up the contract .
This is not a good idea .
I think Tom is insecure .
Tom said he didn't mind .
Shouldn't we go now ?
I don't think Tom will be sympathetic .
You don't need to worry about us .
Where can I park ?
I've never gone out with a Canadian girl .
I'd like that .
We never saw Tom after that .
Tom wants Mary to apologize .
Tom led the guests into the living room .
I was admiring the view .
I can't undo it .
I know exactly how to do it .
I think Tom speaks French well .
We have had fine weather this week .
I don't need that .
Tom will wait for Mary .
Tom is lying on his back .
You are absolutely right .
The Pacific Ocean is one of the five oceans .
I'm sometimes lonely on weekends .
Tom's father , who is in prison , never writes to Tom .
It's compact and lightweight .
Tom wanted to be a farmer .
Now be reasonable .
The skeptics were right .
I am 19 years old .
Tom has done that at least once .
I don't really know anything about Tom .
Can we close the door ?
I don't understand what you are saying .
That's Tom's mother .
Please don't worry about me .
I'll see Tom again on October 20th .
Tom is writing a book about his father .
My sister will prepare breakfast .
Tom gave me advice .
It is rude to speak with your hands in your pockets .
I wonder what Tom did for Mary .
Slander is a crime .
He had three sons .
I didn't fall in love .
You're highly intelligent .
I don't give my children an allowance .
Are you hungry ?
I spent a lot of money remodeling my house .
It's still being tested .
You're not a musician , are you ?
Did you buy a gun ?
That's our baseball field .
Tom yelled Mary's name .
I already told you he isn't here .
The restaurant was almost empty .
Could you be so kind as to speak more slowly , please ?
I don't know why I just did that .
There was nothing to drink .
Tom opened the pizza box .
No one will believe Tom .
Was Tom murdered ?
Tom wasn't a suspect .
All of Tom's children are able to speak French .
My girlfriend is Canadian .
They're back .
Tom never walks to school .
I have just what you need .
She shook hands with him .
He enjoys a good social life .
A kiss without a mustache is like an egg without salt .
The ice is very thick .
Tom does that , doesn't he ?
Does Germany share a border with Switzerland ?
Your dreams will come true .
What's Tom all dressed up for ?
Tom put out the fire with a blanket .
You need to talk to Tom .
Have you sent in your report ?
I knew you weren't from around here .
Is Tom still mowing the lawn ?
Have you discovered anything new today ?
One word is sometimes enough .
He emigrated to Australia .
You're the laziest person I know .
Would you mind me smoking here ?
I will ask him tomorrow .
Thanks for reminding us .
I'm considering studying in America next year .
I hope that works .
What conclusions can be drawn from this ?
I am loved by my parents .
Tom drank a couple of shots of tequila .
We might be in Boston next spring .
He is a perfect gentleman .
He told a good joke .
He is twice as old as I am .
I've got plans .
Tom doesn't know how to ride a bike .
Spanish is her native language .
What motivates you ?
Please lend me this book for a few days .
You must never forget that .
Are they sisters ?
The students didn't know how they should answer .
I was given a nice present by my uncle .
No students could answer the question .
How many people were present at the meeting ?
What is his nationality ?
I guess I was mistaken .
The two languages have a lot in common .
You're really gorgeous .
Tom is the same person he always was .
Tom's lunchbox is in the car .
I know that you miss your family .
The prisoners were set free .
That's not my decision .
Your feet will lead you to where your heart is .
Tom wants to surprise Mary .
It is far from here to Tokyo .
I don't have to know why .
I'm afraid of cats .
I want to visit Tom .
I still can't understand that .
Am I really the only one who thinks this is a bad idea ?
Why won't you answer ?
Please enter now .
What do you want me to do , Tom ?
Tom wished that he could play the guitar .
He lost his eyesight in an accident .
I will write to you next week .
Tom lives a few blocks away from Mary .
Are you saying you aren't going to do that ?
Tom was here all day .
Step to the side .
Is this mine ?
I should've waited for Tom .
What's that building ?
Would you like to stay here ?
Tom manages a hotel .
I bought a book of jokes .
Tom's brothers are still doing that .
How do you heat the house ?
Somehow , he saved himself .
Germs can cause sickness .
Tom has worked hard all his life .
Leave Tom out of this .
I ate too much yesterday .
Does Tom have a beard ?
I'll have it ready for you by tomorrow .
If you're interested , I'll add your name to the list .

He's like a brother to me .

I'm not getting up .
Tom clapped .

When did you get out of jail ?
I had a dream that I won the lottery .
Auguste Comte is regarded as the father of sociology .
I think Mary is beautiful .
We need to leave soon .
If anything comes up , I'll let you know .
"Where is my phone" ? "It's on my desk" .
Let's get together .
I know why Tom is doing that .
Tom usually sleeps with his window open .
I know you didn't do that .
We gave up the plan .
Does Tom know we're here ?
Tom wanted to drive the car .
I haven't sent those pictures to Tom yet .
Tom didn't answer the question directly .
I will write to you soon .
We're sorry for any inconvenience .
Have you changed your profile picture recently ?
We all miss you very much .
That was a waste of time .
Tom is just plain ugly .
Tom must've been mistaken .
I don't have a bicycle .
Does the store you're going to sell rice ? If so , please buy me some .
One cup of coffee , please .
Boston is a wonderful city .
I'm not going to forget you .
You're quite drunk .
Tom won't have to help me .
That's the reason that I accepted the offer .
I don't think she would understand it .
I'm sorry for calling so late . I just wanted to hear your voice .
I didn't think Tom was confused .
We're not doing anything .
He can read well .
Is it true that "Thank you" sounds like "Come on" in Vietnamese ?
Tom told me that he liked rain .
I look forward to meeting Tom .
You'll do it .
I'm thinking about changing jobs .
Do you think Tom is innocent ?
It doesn't matter what he said .
How can I tell if I'm really in love ?
He shot a tiger through the head .
Were you there ?
What should I bring ?
Do you like rock and roll ?
Why don't you tell me ?
How can I find Tom ?
Later , more people were killed .

Is it not black ?
You are such a liar !

Is it going to hurt ?

She woke him up .
Tell me what you saw .
I want to sing a song .
My work is not as easy as yours .
Tom was the one who stopped us from doing that ?
Tom doesn't have time to relax .
We were saved by the bell .
You're not doing this right .
Tom said he's still afraid .
Tom didn't complain .
Tom doesn't know you as well as I do .
I don't know where your painting is .
Sorry , but your brother is an idiot .
I thought that your house was downtown .
What's it made of ?
The glass is full of water .
I don't like hot coffee .
I had lunch with Tom yesterday .
I need to know what happened that night .
He made several corrections .
That's alright .
Answer me .
I pray for you every day .
Tom and I helped each other .
Who'll pay the rent ?
He has worked in the embassy for three months .
Which is correct ?
I think that Tom and Mary are cousins .
We should make it in time if the traffic isn't too heavy .
I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly .
The window was open .

Tom threw out the garbage .
He is no fool .
I felt like God .

I was told to do that .

I don't think Tom lives in Boston anymore .
Tom is eating lunch now , isn't he ?

We don't come to Boston very often .
When do you study ?
The movie was really good .
Let's make sure .
Just get out of here !
When will you be coming back to Boston ?
They ended capitalism and built a socialist society .
How did you find me ?
Who lives with you ?
I wonder if Tom isn't happy here .
I love hot dogs .
Where is the problem ?
Please forgive me .
This is for internal use .
Can you open it ?

It was believed that the sun went around the earth .
I'm happy Tom did that .
We only do what we've been told .

I've made a list of things I'd like to buy .
I'll stay here till you get back .
There is a hut at the back of our house .
This is the house where I lived when I was a child .

Please bring the others .
There are various kinds of coffee .

I've never been lost .
Are you free ?

I'd like to be rich and not have to worry about money .
Have you ever been to a high school reunion ?
Tom wasn't my commanding officer .
We've been living here since October .

Don't worry . I won't tell anyone a thing .
Tom lost his son in the war .
The plane's doors were already closed when Tom got to the gate .
You know what I want .
Tom should've sung the song Mary requested .
Who's older , your mother or your father ?

You don't have to say anything if you don't feel like it .
How dare you say that to me !
You've come too early .
Tom watched cartoons with his children .
"We have a problem" . "What sort of problem" ?
They seem happy .
I wanted to know what was happening .
The crowd moaned .
If I read this book once more , I shall have read it three times .
What do they want with Tom ?
Can you stay for a few days ?
Tom is wise enough not to do such a thing .
This tool is inexpensive and easy to use .
I'll do what Tom says .
I'm very curious about that .
What do you think I've been doing ?
Tom began to have second thoughts .
I love playing chess .
I didn't write that .
Behave yourself .
Tom doesn't want to be lonely .
I will leave as soon as the bell rings .
Why should I leave ?
I'm not going to die today .

Tom doesn't like the way Mary looks at him .
His family is large .
Tom started up the car .
I must do something .
I still really like it .
Will we be allowed to do that here ?
Have you prepared everything for tomorrow ?
I never for a moment imagined that I would win .
We have arrived .
I want to dye my hair red .
How did Tom and Mary meet ?
The sea is rough .
He said he was tired , so he would go home early .
Everyone danced .
Tom is my kid .
We're going to tell Tom tomorrow .
Tom's father was very strict .
I want to know if you're planning on going to Australia with us next month .
I have a friend whose father is an animal doctor .
Tom and his brother are not at all alike .
Tom didn't have time to relax .
I didn't hear the doorbell .
His wife is French .

Where are the glasses ?
Feel free to sit anywhere you want .
Let me show you where Australia is on the map .
I'll continue to offer advice .

Everyone thinks I'm weird .
It was for Tom and Mary .
What did you want to talk about ?
Tom does what he can .
You really should be quiet in here .
Tom is lucky .
He doesn't know the difference between good and evil .
Please remain seated .
I don't know what I'm going to do yet .
That has us concerned .
I think you need to tell Tom how you feel .
Why would we want to punish you ?
You're not welcome .
Your friends are late .
Tom didn't know that Mary needed help .
What do you want me for ?
He invited me to the party .
Do you have any evidence ?
Attempts to fight the fire with buckets soon proved fruitless .

That skirt's too short , isn't it ?
How's the dog ?
I trust the teacher .
Are these Tom's ?
Wake up at seven , please .
The curtains are open .
I don't care who's watching .
I'm sure Tom misses Mary .
I don't want you to do that , Tom .
Time for dinner .
There was fear in his eyes .
Who are you talking about ?
The rain kept us from going out .
Origami is the art of folding paper .
Let's make use of our time wisely .
Tom , are you awake ?
I have no idea where Tom is now .
The judge sentenced him to one year's imprisonment .
I feel empowered .
I'm not your father .
What can you offer ?
Would you like to play soccer with us ?
She is more wise than clever .
We're not getting anywhere .
I don't want to hear it .
I wonder if Tom told Mary she had to do that .
We want it back .
I think that we're out of control .
I don't know anything .
Is there a cure for stupidity ?
Tom should've hugged Mary .
I haven't talked to Tom yet .
Tom seems like a reliable person .
Don't count on Tom .
I'm not who you think I am .
Go on .
They are in need of volunteers .
That was an illusion .
I don't speak French as well as I'd like .
Which one would you like ?

Unfortunately , I missed my flight , so I won't get to Boston in time for the meeting .
Please tell Tom Mary called .

Watch out ! There's a big hole there .
I pity your future wife .
Where's your other earring ?

Tom would've succeeded if he'd worked harder .
Tom's speech was really funny .
I have many things to do .
Ain't she cute ?
I used to be lazy .
How many students are there in your class ?

What's up , dude ?
I'd rather go to Boston .
Can't we just go ?
Tom was almost run over by a truck .
What time do you arrive home ?

Those troops are going into action .
Are you students ?
The post office is adjacent to the library .
Tell Tom I have a broken leg .

Tom , are you listening ?
Are you sure that Tom is behind this ?
Tom cleaned his room .
She obeys him .
The boy is thirsty .
I can't tell you how many times I've thought about all the good times we used to have together .
Tom really loved Australia .
I bought a red T-shirt yesterday .
In 1853 , the first blue jeans came out .
There's no entertainment in the countryside .
Do you drink coffee with milk ?
Tom doesn't like me very much .
It's raining again !
We need a watchdog .
That's a nice T-shirt .
Tom did what I asked right away .
I didn't think you even liked Tom .
What have you bought your girlfriend for Christmas ?
They paid separately .
You're always too serious .
Look at it again .
The plan is working .
Let's think about that for a moment .
Tom isn't much of a drinker .
He is a doctor .
Tom and Mary were waiting .
Read this .
He barely escaped death .
What time did you arrive at the hospital ?
Don't you think you should help Tom ?
The work was very difficult .
There's a bank across from the hotel .
I've lost my car key .
You all are useless .

I interviewed Tom .
You look surprised to see me .
Don't touch this !
That did me good .
My clock seems to be broken .
Tom just wants to help you .
I know that I'm going to die .
It is up to you to decide whether we will go there or not .
This road is terrible .
There are 35 students in this class .
You ought to buy this for Tom .
I've already tried it .
Do you think English is difficult ?

One must observe the rules .
When I get through with my work , I'll call you .
I wanted to eat steak .
The future of mankind rests in your hands .

It's a pain in the neck .
She is thirty-one .
I don't know when he's coming .
Does Coca-Cola contain caffeine ?
Tom never had to study French .
That's confusing .
I appreciate your prudence .
You're too young to drive a car .
You have to surrender .
Tom didn't seem to be very impressed .
I want to hire you .
The traffic jam was caused by an accident .
Please stop that .
No one is there .
We had a plan .
As I see it , that is the best way .

It was really horrible .
Tell us something about yourselves .
The conference will end tomorrow .
Compare the signatures .
Do you think Tom will help us ?

Are you looking for something in particular ?
He came to Japan as a child .
I don't like the idea of leaving Tom alone .
You should probably speak a little bit slower .

Don't give it to him . Give it to me .
How many pictures does Tom plan on taking ?
I'll take care of the dog till tomorrow .

Is Tom still eating ?
OK , listen up .
We're all ready .
I don't know what to expect .
I had work to do .
We should go back to the ship .
Tom couldn't start the motor .
Tom just went nuts .
Tom's house is just about three kilometers from here .
I'm not interested in politics .
Close the gate .
The village had more than a thousand inhabitants .
You have a little fever today , don't you ?
When I came to the school , there was nobody there anymore .
Tom wasn't mistaken , was he ?
I couldn't help laughing at the plan .
He's an animal .
I was going to work .
Do people really pay you to do this ?
I hope that Tom will arrive soon .
No one understands how I feel .
Why on earth are you here ?
Study harder .
I have food .
If you keep on like this , you'll probably live to reach 120 !
Tom loves dogs .
My family thinks I've lost my mind .
Clearly Tom and Mary hate each other .

I love you .
I hope it pans out .
Do you want to drive ?
Give me a little more water .

I wish you'd stop asking that .
Why didn't Tom call for help ?
Why's everyone calling me Tom ?
Tom knew that Mary couldn't do what she wanted to do .
Tom didn't want anybody to get angry .
I'll explain this later .
Tom speaks more slowly than Mary does .
Please don't feed the pigeons .
The bridge gave way .

I need a bag .
Tom looked awful .
My reputation is at stake .
I'm a light sleeper .
First we'll eat , and then we'll go .

I'm excited .
No one was watching .

Not everyone will understand .
The lion is the king of the beasts .
What do you hope to find here ?
Does your dog bark at everyone ?
Does Tom shower every day ?
I still love the way you smile at me .
Who will you vote for ?
He was underwater for three minutes .
Maybe your problem is that you don't know what to do .
Who sent you here ?
Where is my diary ?
Many shoes nowadays are made of plastics .
All Tom ate was bananas .
My dog likes you .
I took off my coat .
I felt very uneasy .
Please sit at the table .
That doesn't mean that we have to give up .
I knew Tom would say no .
They walked for ten miles , rested for ten minutes , then walked again .
There are many cultures on Earth .

Some of the money was stolen .
You're starting to annoy me .
You should pay more attention to nutrition .
Am I dying ?
Are you open tonight ?
I will get in touch with you .
I have many things to do .
I hope Tom doesn't change his mind .
You're screaming .
You ought to know better than to go to such a dangerous place .
Why are you in my room ?
They live downstairs .
I just learned a new word .
She went blind .
What are they made of ?
I have been in Japan for two months .
Come and get it .
I was shocked to see this .

We've got company .
Stop at the corner .
He was blinded in an accident .

He's sitting at an empty table .
Just as I was about to go out , it started raining .
Doesn't Tom live in Boston ?
Tom always arrives on time .
Tom said Mary was driving the car when the accident happened .
I am dozing off .
There are cherry trees on each side of the street .

You stay there .
I love fishing .
I'm not satisfied with what you've done .
What shall I cook for the guests tomorrow ?
You know I can't go to Australia with you .
I'm looking for someone who understands French .
Tom isn't naive anymore .
Please reply in Chinese or English .
"Thanks for the help" . "Don't mention it" .
I heard what you were saying .

Did you live in Boston last year ?

I'm not a liar .
Tom texted Mary .
I am not a teacher .
They're so funny .
Tom lost his camera in Boston .
I dried the dishes .

Can you eat these ?
He wrote to me yesterday .
We sailed from Yokohama to Kobe .
Tom started learning French when he was very young .
I wish that I'd helped Tom at the time .
We have many friends .
Tom may have gone already .
You have a heart of stone .

Dogs often bury bones .
Lay down on the couch .
I think this layout is very good .

For some reason , it's not working .
Let's do it another time .
Let's look ahead to the next century .
I bought what I needed .
Doing that is hard .
Tom wants to go with you .
Mary likes to wear clothes with vertical stripes , because she heard they make you look thinner .
Where did I put the keys ?
We Germans fear God , but nothing else in the world .
I don't want you to stay here and watch me suffer .
I don't completely agree with you .
I'm not sneaky . I'm just discreet .
Where's the package you wanted me to deliver ?
You can come with us .
Fragments of the mirror were scattered on the floor .
I'm sure you're not surprised .
Aren't you and Tom related ?

Please put the books in order .
Tom wished he hadn't spent so much money .
What do you do in your free time ?
Turn up the radio a little bit .
Tom's eyes are huge .

That doesn't mean that we have to give up .
I'm the strongest .
Tom knew that I was depressed .
I wish you had said something to us before .

You obviously don't live here .
There were almost no cars in the parking lot .
I got this vacuum cleaner for nothing .
What are you planning to do next ?
When I was a kid , I went to Boston every summer to visit my grandparents .
I blew the candle out .
Where's the shirt that I bought you ?
You helped us do that last year .
Why is Tom laughing at you ?
I still haven't done what you've asked me to do .
Tom is the only Canadian I know .
I felt faint with hunger .
The only true language in the world is a kiss .
Let me talk to your manager .
I'm very organized .
I heard someone calling my name .
Let's wait here till he comes back .
It's time to take the pie out of the oven .
It won't make any difference .
We haven't yet discussed that problem .
This T-shirt costs ten dollars .
We know you're there .
She makes a point of remembering each one of our birthdays .

She was on the verge of killing herself .
I can't believe it's really Tom .
I'm sure someone will help you do that .
There's been change of plan .
I don't know how to play the piano .
The package arrived three hours ago .
Tom is the richest person I know .
I bought two tickets for the concert .
It happened so long ago .
I don't know how to handle children .
He hasn't told me when he will return .
The concert was incredible .
I tried to write with my left hand .
Let's give it one more try .
I don't want to play this game .
Tom wasn't the last one to go home .
I think this is mine .
He began running .
It's not authentic , Tom .

I don't have time to help you .
I'm glad I've finally caught you .
We all need to calm down .
I'm going to take a shower .
Is the bank open ?
We have visitors .
She was stupid enough to believe him .
Never tell a lie again .
Please wait outside the house .
He had to stay in bed .
I would've never gone there without you .
I could keep it a secret , but not for too long .
I can't believe what I just saw .
Tom loves his wife .
I did the job to the best of my ability .
I never thought of that .
What're you drinking ?
Tom has what he wants .
The cat caught a mouse .
Are you ready to go ?
It must've been the day before Tom got here that I got up before dawn .
We're high school students .
To master English is difficult .
Tom can speak French almost as well as he can speak Spanish .

When do you have to be in Boston ?
I don't hate anything .

Tom said he was going to kiss Mary .
Tom has been doing that very well .
Will you let me at it ?
I think those are Tom's books .

It is our turn to laugh .
Tom didn't understand .
The girls are shy .
Would you like to ask me something else ?
Which would you choose ?
I like fish .
Tom is still a child .
I have a swollen ankle .
What is it that you want me to do ?
Let's begin at the beginning .
We rode on a boat .
Tom has a bank account in the Cayman Islands .
I think I drank too much .
Tom is too clingy .
I've done the same thing myself .
They aren't like us .
I never thought about studying French .
You're old .
Tom would understand .
Whose suitcase is that ?
I asked her to wait a minute .
Tom fixed the fence .
He took over the business from his father .
I'm glad you've decided not to do that .
There were few children in the room .
Gradually the true meaning of what he said began to dawn on me .
Father drives to work .
I still haven't found my passport .
They had to promise to obey the laws of Mexico .
I wonder if it'll rain tomorrow .

Do you want me to do it ?
How can I ever forgive myself ?
I miss my family .
Tom drank three glasses of water .
Why are you upset ?
Where are the bags from Flight 57 ?
They're strong .
Tom lost his phone .
I don't know who you're talking about .
He is a physicist .
I assume that you're Canadian .
Why would you think that's a good idea ?
Mary made a cake without her mother's knowledge .
I want to confess .
He doesn't sing well .
I didn't find anything .
I am okay .
Tom opened the door slowly .
You have ice cream on your face .
A fight broke out in our neighborhood .
I want to know how much it's going to cost me to go to Australia with you .
You should never take your eyes off the road while you're driving .

Do you think Tom will have time to help us ?
Tom asked me where I had bought my bicycle .
This is true .
Tom doesn't have much time to waste .
Tom hasn't heard from Mary since she moved to Australia .
Where's the kitchen ?
I speak French , too .

It's hard to understand his ideas .
Write me an email if you feel like it .
Some people think that hang gliding is a dangerous sport .
Did you like the movie ?
What's the title of that book ?
Tom is waiting for us in the park .
Try not to make this same mistake again .
Tom is in the kitchen cooking something .
I'm sorry I can't go .
Will it rain this afternoon ?
Can Tom come to Boston with you ?
I think it's better for us to adopt his plan .
He bent his back .
Are you quite sure ?
I wonder whether Tom can swim as well as Mary can .
Nothing is wrong .
Who's your French teacher ?
Are there many animals in the zoo ?
It was kind of surreal .
We do care about that .
Do you see them ?
Please come to my room to help me .
If it's possible , I'd like to exchange this for a larger size .
Where did you park my car ?
I'm fed up with him always preaching to me .
Tom said you like popcorn .
How many do you have ?
Have another .
Does anybody want to buy this ?
Are you going to the movies ?
Too much is at stake .
Could you please turn your television down ?
Tom is finally asleep .
We're still here .
I don't worry so much about my resume .
I'm looking forward to meeting you .
He wants only the best .
I don't like any of Tom's friends .
They've changed a lot .
I just didn't know what to do .
Take a little nap on the couch .
Is it an illusion ?
Tom wanted to learn to read .
Tom is a wise man .
I wish I was by your side right now .
Did you hear the roar of the lions ?
I never touch beer .
What Tom really wanted was a rest .
Tom should've done that with me .
She's an admirable woman .
I can't stand Tom anymore .
Speak up !
Is there a washing machine in the house ?

This is her T-shirt . That T-shirt is hers , too .
When did you open your new store ?
Why were you here ?
Tom may become jealous .
That's no way to talk to your students .
We have someone else to do this .
They seem surprised .
I don't want to die now .
I accept your conditions .
That'll put you in danger .
I'm aware of all that .
I wish I could prevent that .
I'm the gardener .
Is it tasty ?
I need to get a babysitter .
You're wasting your time and ours .
Are you open on Saturday ?
The nurse is not here .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
I don't understand English at all .
I drank a shot .
It's very hot today .
Where are you staying ?
I don't have time to read .
Do you guys use Facebook ?
What are they doing ?
Here or to go ?
Tom managed to run away .
I haven't heard from you for a long time .
He hasn't come yet . He must have missed the bus .
Is it OK if I change the channel ?
Are you very hungry ?
I'm counting on you to help me out .
Will the therapy cause me any pain ?
I figured it out alone .
I fail to see the difference .

It was fabulous .
I'd like to be as rich as Tom .
The rain didn't last long .
This poem was originally written in French .
That's a reasonable concern .
Stop complaining .
Please listen .
This is Tom's sister .
As soon as Tom heard the phone , he answered it .
The police have blocked off the area .
No matter what he says , don't trust him .
Let's not forget human rights .
You're hurting me , Tom .
I washed my own shirt .
Tom is getting married three months from now .
He not only speaks French , but he speaks Spanish , too .
Where did you go ?

That's no longer necessary .
Tom is adopted .
It's so much fun .

I'm ready when you are .
It would take too long to explain to you .

The closet door is stuck .
I'm not responsible for what Tom has done .
I had to stop .
You look different .
I have a new pair of socks .

If it rains tomorrow , I'll stay home .
You know this .
Where do you want to live ?
You look depressed .

I'm getting married .
I worked on a farm .
Tom couldn't speak French when I first met him .
You think doing that would be a mistake , don't you ?
Put it where you like .

Things happened .
I'm also interested in Greek mythology .
Are you still afraid ?
I'll be back at seven o'clock .
Tom got poked in the eye .
Tom threatened to call the police .
Mom , where's my handkerchief ?
Don't give them anything .
You're the only person I know who's my age .
Tom was already there by the time I got there .
What made you think I'd be interested in this ?
I felt powerless .
That's what I was working on .
Is your husband also from Boston ?
They already have one .
Could you please wait here ?
