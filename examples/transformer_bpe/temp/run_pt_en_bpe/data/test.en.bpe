TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Tom W@@ u@@ je@@ c presents some surprisingly deep research into the "@@ marshmal@@ low problem@@ " - a simple te@@ am-@@ building exercise that involves dry spagh@@ et@@ ti, one yard of tape and a marshmal@@ low. Who can build the tal@@ lest tower with these ingredi@@ ent@@ s? And why does a surprising group always beat the aver@@ age?
Tom W@@ u@@ jec@@ : Buil@@ d a tow@@ er, build a team.
Sever@@ al years ago here at TED, Peter S@@ kill@@ man introduced a design challenge called the marshmal@@ low challenge.
And the ide@@ a's pretty simple@@ : Te@@ ams of four have to build the tal@@ lest free-@@ standing structure out of 20 sticks of spagh@@ et@@ ti, one yard of ta@@ pe, one yard of string and a marshmal@@ low.
The marshmal@@ low has to be on top.
And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly.
And so, I thought this was an interesting idea, and I incorpor@@ ated it into a design worksho@@ p.
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I've conducted about 70 design worksho@@ ps across the world with students and designers and architec@@ ts, even the C@@ T@@ Os of the Fortune 50, and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collabor@@ ation, and I'd like to share some of them with you.
So, norm@@ ally, most people begin by orient@@ ing themselves to the task.
They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like, they j@@ oc@@ key for power.
Then they spend some time plan@@ ning, organiz@@ ing, they sketch and they lay out spagh@@ et@@ ti.
They spend the majority of their time assem@@ bling the sticks into ever-@@ growing structures.
And then finally, just as they're running out of time, someone takes out the marshmal@@ low, and then they g@@ inger@@ ly put it on top, and then they stand back, and - ta-@@ d@@ a! - they admir@@ e their work.
But what really happens, most of the time, is that the "@@ ta-@@ d@@ a" turns into an "@@ u@@ h-@@ o@@ h@@ ," because the weight of the marshmal@@ low causes the entire structure to buck@@ le and to collapse.
So there are a number of people who have a lot more "@@ u@@ h-@@ o@@ h@@ " moments than others, and among the worst are recent graduates of business school.
They lie, they che@@ at, they get distrac@@ ted and they produce really l@@ ame structures.
And of course there are teams that have a lot more "@@ ta-@@ d@@ a" structures, and among the best are recent graduates of kindergar@@ ten.
And it's pretty amazing.
As Peter tells us, not only do they produce the tal@@ lest structures, but they're the most interesting structures of them all.
So the question you want to ask is: How com@@ e? Why? What is it about them?
And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of S@@ pag@@ h@@ et@@ ti, In@@ c. Right?
They don't spend time j@@ oc@@ ke@@ ying for power.
But there's another reason as well.
And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan, right?
And then they exec@@ ute on it.
And then what happens is, when they put the marshmal@@ low on the top, they run out of time and what happens?
It's a crisis.
S@@ ound famili@@ ar? Right.
What kindergar@@ ten@@ ers do differently is that they start with the marshmal@@ low, and they build proto@@ types, success@@ ive proto@@ types, always keeping the marshmal@@ low on top, so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.
Design@@ ers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iter@@ ative process.
And with each version, kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work.
So the capacity to play in prototype is really essenti@@ al, but let's look at how different teams perfor@@ m.
So the average for most people is around 20 inch@@ es; business schools students, about half of that@@ ; lawy@@ ers, a little better, but not much better than that, kindergar@@ ten@@ ers, better than most adults.
Who does the very best@@ ?
Architec@@ ts and engineers, thank@@ fully.
Thir@@ ty-@@ nine inches is the tal@@ lest structure I've seen.
And why is it? Because they understand triang@@ les and self-@@ rein@@ forcing geometr@@ ical patterns are the key to building stable structures.
So CE@@ Os, a little bit better than average, but here's where it gets interesting.
If you put you put an executive ad@@ min@@ . on the team, they get significantly better.
It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team@@ 's going to win@@ ."
You can just tell befor@@ e@@ hand. And why is that?
Because they have special skills of facilit@@ ation.
They manage the process, they understand the process.
And any team who man@@ ages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team@@ 's performance.
Speci@@ alized skills and facil@@ itation skills are the combination that leads to strong success.
If you have 10 teams that typically perfor@@ m, you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.
And I tried something interesting.
I thought, let's up the ante, once.
So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.
So what do you think happened to these design student@@ s?
What was the resul@@ t?
Here's what happen@@ ed: Not one team had a standing structure.
If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure, they would have taken home the pr@@ ize.
So, isn't that interest@@ ing? That high sta@@ kes have a strong impact.
We did the exercise again with the same students.
What do you think happened then?
So now they understand the value of proto@@ typ@@ ing.
So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best.
They produced the tal@@ lest structures in the least amount of time.
So there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success.
So, you might ask@@ : Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmal@@ low challen@@ ge?
And the reason is, I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects.
And what the marshmal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assump@@ tions.
Because, frankly, every project has its own marshmal@@ low, doesn't it?
The challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common st@@ ance to build the right prototy@@ pe.
And so, this is the value of the experience, of this so simple exercis@@ e.
And those of you who are interested may want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ .com.
It's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmal@@ low@@ s.
There's ste@@ p-@@ by-@@ step instructions on this.
There are crazy examples from around the world of how people twe@@ ak and adjust the system.
There's world records that are on this as well.
And the fundamental less@@ on, I believe, is that design truly is a contact sport@@ .
It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task, and that we apply the very best of our thinking, our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand.
And sometimes, a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an "@@ u@@ h-@@ o@@ h@@ " moment to a "@@ ta-@@ d@@ a" moment.
And that can make a big difference.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: V@@ ac@@ cin@@ e-@@ autism claim@@ s, "@@ Frank@@ en@@ food@@ " ban@@ s, the her@@ b@@ al cure craz@@ e: All point to the public@@ 's growing fear of science and reason, says Michael S@@ pec@@ ter. He war@@ ns the trend sp@@ ells disaster for human progress.
Michael S@@ pec@@ ter: The danger of science deni@@ al.
Let's pretend right here we have a machine.
A big machine, a cool, TED@@ -@@ ish machine, and it's a time machine.
And everyone in this room has to get into it.
And you can go back@@ wards, you can go forwar@@ d@@ s; you cannot stay where you are.
And I wonder what you'd choos@@ e, because I've been asking my friends this question a lot l@@ ately and they all want to go back.
I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobil@@ es or Twitter or "@@ American I@@ dol@@ ."
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nostal@@ gia, to wish@@ ful thinking.
And I understand that.
I'm not part of that crow@@ d, I have to say.
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm advent@@ ur@@ ous.
It's because possibilities on this planet, they don't go back, they go forward.
So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward.
This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choos@@ e: health, wealth, mobil@@ ity, opportunity, declin@@ ing rates of disease ...
There's never been a time like this.
My great-@@ grandparents died, all of them, by the time they were 60.
My grandparents pushed that number to 70.
My parents are closing in on 80.
So there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number.
But it's not even about people like us, because this is a bigger deal than that.
A kid born in New Delh@@ i today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago.
Think about that, it's an incredible fact.
And why is it tru@@ e?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x. S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet.
It res@@ ha@@ ped the demo@@ graphy of the globe in a way that no war ever has.
It's gone. It's van@@ ished.
We van@@ quis@@ hed it. Pu@@ ff@@ .
In the rich world, diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist, hard@@ ly.
Di@@ ph@@ ther@@ ia, rub@@ ell@@ a, polio ...
Does anyone even know what those things are?
V@@ ac@@ cin@@ es, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, those are trium@@ ph@@ s of the scientific meth@@ od.
And to my mind, the scientific method - trying stuff out, seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't - is one of the great accomplish@@ ments of humanity.
So that's the good news.
Unfortunately, that's all the good news because there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times.
And one of them is that despite all our accomplish@@ ments, a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day.
That number@@ 's ris@@ ing, and it's rising really rapid@@ ly, and it's dis@@ grac@@ eful@@ .
And not only that, we've used our imagination to thor@@ ough@@ ly trash this globe.
Po@@ table water, ar@@ able land, rain@@ forests, oil, gas@@ : they're going away, and they're going away soon, and unless we innovate our way out of this m@@ ess, we're going away too.
So the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can.
I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without rap@@ ing the land that they live on.
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it.
I really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wish@@ ful thinking.
But here's the thing that keeps me up at night - one of the things that keeps me up at nigh@@ t: We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. N@@ ever.
And we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today.
We're on the ver@@ ge of amazing, amazing events in many fiel@@ ds, and yet I actually think we'd have to go back hundred@@ s, 300 years, before the En@@ lighten@@ ment, to find a time when we batt@@ led progress, when we fought about these things more vigor@@ ously, on more fron@@ ts, than we do now.
People wrap themselves in their belief@@ s, and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free.
Not even the truth will set them free.
And, listen, everyone's entit@@ led to their opin@@ ion@@ ; they're even entit@@ led to their opinion about progress.
But you know what you're not entit@@ led to?
You're not entit@@ led to your own facts. Sorr@@ y, you're not.
And this took me a@@ while to figure out.
About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for The New York@@ er. A little story.
And I was amazed to find opposi@@ tion: op@@ position to what is, after all, the most effective public health measure in human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.
And soon after that, I wrote a story about genetically engineered food.
Same thing, only bigger.
People were going crazy.
So I wrote a story about that too, and I couldn't understand why people thought this was "@@ Frank@@ en@@ food@@ s," why they thought moving molecules around in a specific@@ , rather than a hap@@ haz@@ ard way, was tr@@ esp@@ ass@@ ing on nature's ground.
But, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on.
I mean, I'm a journal@@ ist.
We type, we fi@@ le, we go to din@@ ner. It's fine.
But these stories bo@@ thered me, and I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did.
And that's because those fan@@ atic@@ s that were driving me crazy weren't actually fan@@ atic@@ s at all.
They were though@@ tful people, educated people, decent people.
They were exactly like the people in this room.
And it just dist@@ ur@@ bed me so much.
But then I thought, you know, let's be hon@@ est.
We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.
We talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently.
We talk about it in iron@@ ic terms with little quo@@ tes around it: "@@ progress@@ ."
Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.
We've lost faith in institutions, in author@@ ity, and sometimes in science itself, and there's no reason we shouldn't have.
You can just say a few names and people will understand.
Cherno@@ by@@ l, B@@ hop@@ al, the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er, Vi@@ ox@@ x, weapons of mass destruction, hanging ch@@ ads.
You know, you can choose your list.
There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right, so be skep@@ tical.
Ask questions, demand pro@@ of, demand evidence.
Don't take anything for gran@@ ted.
But here's the thing: When you get pro@@ of, you need to accept the pro@@ of, and we're not that good at doing that.
And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one I've never seen and hope never to see again.
About 12 years ago, there was a story published, a horrible story, that linked the epidemic of autism to the meas@@ les, m@@ um@@ ps and rub@@ ella vaccine shot.
Very scar@@ y.
T@@ ons of studies were done to see if this was true.
T@@ ons of studies should have been don@@ e; it's a serious issue.
The data came back.
The data came back from the United States, from England, from Swed@@ en, from Canada, and it was all the sam@@ e: no cor@@ rel@@ ation, no connection, none at all.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because we believe anecdo@@ tes, we believe what we see, what we think we see, what makes us feel real.
We don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data, and I do understand that, I think we all do.
But you know what?
The result of that has been dis@@ astr@@ ous.
Dis@@ astr@@ ous because here's a fac@@ t: The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for meas@@ les is going down.
That is dis@@ grac@@ eful, and we should be ash@@ amed of ourselves.
It's horri@@ ble.
What kind of a thing happened that we could do that?
Now, I understand it. I do understand it.
Because, did anyone have meas@@ les here?
Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas@@ l@@ es?
Doesn't happen very much.
Doesn't happen in this country at all, but it happened 1@@ 60,000 times in the world last year.
That's a lot of death of meas@@ les - 20 an hour.
But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds, and people like Jen@@ ny Mc@@ Car@@ thy can go around pre@@ aching messages of fear and il@@ literacy from platforms like "O@@ pr@@ ah@@ " and "L@@ arry King Li@@ ve."
And they can do it because they don't link caus@@ ation and cor@@ rel@@ ation.
They don't understand that these things seem the same, but they're almost never the same.
And it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon.
This guy was a her@@ o, Jonas Sal@@ k.
He took one of the worst s@@ cour@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us.
No fear, no agon@@ y. Pol@@ io - pu@@ ff, gone.
That guy in the middle, not so much.
His name is Paul O@@ ff@@ it.
He just developed a rot@@ av@@ ir@@ us vaccine with a bunch of other people.
It'll save the lives of 400 to 5@@ 00,000 kids in the developing world every year.
Pretty good, right?
Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ in@@ ing.
And he actually says it that way.
So, Paul@@ 's a terror@@ ist.
When Paul speaks in a public hear@@ ing, he can't testi@@ fy without armed guar@@ ds.
He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school.
And why? Because Paul made a vaccin@@ e.
I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essenti@@ al.
You take them away, disease comes back, horrible diseases. And that's happening.
We have meas@@ les in this country now.
And it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game.
And they're not just going to die of meas@@ les.
What about poli@@ o? Let's have that. Why not?
A college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little str@@ id@@ ent.
No one's ever said that before.
She wasn't going to vaccin@@ ate her kid against poli@@ o, no way.
Fin@@ e.
Why? Because we don't have poli@@ o. And you know what?
We didn't have polio in this country yester@@ day.
Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lag@@ os this morning, and he's flying to L@@ A@@ X, right now he's over O@@ hi@@ o.
And he's going to land in a couple of hours, he's going to rent a car, and he's going to come to Long Beach, and he's going to at@@ tend one of these fabulous TED din@@ ners ton@@ ight.
And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paraly@@ tic disease, and we don't either because that's the way the world works.
That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't.
Now, we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it.
Everyone take their vitam@@ ins this mor@@ n@@ ing?
E@@ chin@@ ace@@ a, a little anti@@ oxid@@ ant to get you going.
I know you did because half of Americans do every day.
They take the stuff, and they take alternative medic@@ ines, and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're us@@ eless.
The data says it all the time.
They dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine. They almost never do more than that.
It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ in@@ e?
I'm totally with you.
Dar@@ k ur@@ ine. Dar@@ k.
Why do we do that? Why do we do that?
Well, I think I understand, we hate Big P@@ har@@ ma.
We hate Big Govern@@ ment. We don't trust the M@@ an.
And we shoul@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t: Our health care system suc@@ ks.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely astonish@@ ingly cold and soul@@ -@@ b@@ ending to those of us who can even afford it.
So we run away from it, and where do we run@@ ?
We leap into the arms of Big Pl@@ ace@@ b@@ o.
That's fantastic. I love Big Pl@@ ace@@ b@@ o.
But, you know, it's really a serious thing because this stuff is cr@@ ap, and we spend billions of dollars on it.
And I have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here.
None of it ... gin@@ k@@ go, fraud@@ ; e@@ chin@@ ace@@ a, fraud@@ ; ac@@ ai - I don't even know what that is but we're spending billions of dollars on it - it's fraud@@ .
And you know what? When I say this stuff, people scre@@ am at me, and they say, "What do you car@@ e? Let people do what they want to do.
It makes them feel good@@ ."
And you know what? You're wrong.
Because I don't care if it's the secre@@ tary of H@@ H@@ S who's saying, "H@@ mm, I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammo@@ gram@@ s," or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enem@@ as.
When you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science, you end up in a place you don't want to be.
You end up in Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ be@@ ki South Africa.
He killed 4@@ 00,000 of his people by insist@@ ing that bee@@ tro@@ o@@ t, gar@@ lic and lem@@ on oil were much more effective than the anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS.
Hund@@ reds of thousands of need@@ less deaths in a country that has been pl@@ agu@@ ed worse than any other by this disease.
P@@ leas@@ e, don't tell me there are no consequences to these things.
There are. There always are.
Now, the most mind@@ less epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absur@@ d battle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of genetically engineered food and the organic eli@@ te.
It's an idio@@ tic debate. It has to stop.
It's a debate about words, about metaphor@@ s.
It's ide@@ ology, it's not science.
Every single thing we eat, every grain of ric@@ e, every s@@ pri@@ g of par@@ sle@@ y, every Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s spr@@ out has been modi@@ fied by man.
You know, there weren't tang@@ er@@ ines in the garden of E@@ den.
There wasn't any cant@@ al@@ ou@@ pe. There weren't Christmas trees. We made it all.
We made it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years.
And some of it worked, and some of it didn't.
We got rid of the stuff that didn't.
Now we can do it in a more precise way - and there are ris@@ ks, absolutely - but we can put something like vitamin A into ric@@ e, and that stuff can help millions of people, millions of people, prol@@ ong their lives.
You don't want to do that?
I have to say, I don't understand it.
We object to genetically engineered food.
Why do we do that?
Well, the things I constantly hear are@@ : Too many chemic@@ als, pestic@@ ides, hormon@@ es, mon@@ ocul@@ ture, we don't want giant fields of the same thing, that's wrong.
We don't companies pat@@ ent@@ ing life.
We don't want companies ow@@ ning se@@ eds.
And you know what my response to all of that is?
Yes, you're right. Let's fix it.
It's true, we've got a huge food problem, but this isn't science.
This has nothing to do with science.
It's law, it's mor@@ ality, it's patent stuff.
You know science isn't a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an ide@@ a; it's a process.
It's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it does@@ n't, but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afr@@ aid, is really very dead@@ en@@ ing, and it's preventing millions of people from prosper@@ ing.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now, 70 percent.
This investment in Africa over the last 30 years.
Dis@@ grac@@ eful@@ . Dis@@ grac@@ eful@@ .
They need it, and we're not giving it to them.
And why? G@@ ene@@ tically engineered food.
We don't want to encourage people to eat that rot@@ ten stuff, like c@@ ass@@ ava for inst@@ ance.
C@@ ass@@ av@@ a's something that half a billion people eat.
It's kind of like a pot@@ ato.
It's just a bunch of calori@@ es. It suc@@ ks.
It doesn't have nutri@@ ents, it doesn't have protein, and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now.
And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind.
They wouldn't star@@ ve, and you know what?
That would be nice. It wouldn't be Che@@ z Pan@@ is@@ se, but it would be nice.
And all I can say about this is: Why are we fighting it?
I mean, let's ask ourselv@@ es: Why are we fighting it?
Because we don't want to move genes ar@@ ound@@ ?
This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemic@@ als.
It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormon@@ es, our insist@@ ence on having bigger food, better food, singular food.
This isn't about R@@ ice Kris@@ pi@@ es, this is about keeping people alive, and it's about time we started to understand what that me@@ ant.
Because, you know some@@ thing?
If we don't, if we continue to act the way we're ac@@ ting, we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of@@ : high-tech colon@@ i@@ alism.
There's no other way to describe what's going on here.
It's self@@ ish, it's ug@@ ly, it's beneath us, and we really have to stop it.
So after this amazingly fun conversation, you might want to say, "@@ So, you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forwar@@ d@@ ?"
Absolu@@ tely. Absolu@@ tely, I do.
It's stuck in the present right now, but we have an amazing opportunity.
We can set that time machine on anything we want.
We can move it where we want to move it, and we're going to move it where we want to move it.
We have to have these conversations and we have to think, but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead, we're going to be happy we do.
I know that we can, and as far as I'm concer@@ ned, that's something the world needs right now.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Robert G@@ up@@ ta, violin@@ ist with the L@@ A Ph@@ ilh@@ ar@@ mon@@ ic, talks about a viol@@ in lesson he once gave to a brilli@@ ant, schizophren@@ ic musician - and what he lear@@ ned. Cal@@ led back on@@ stage later, G@@ up@@ ta plays his own trans@@ crip@@ tion of the pre@@ lu@@ de from B@@ ach@@ 's C@@ ell@@ o Su@@ ite No. 1.
Robert G@@ up@@ ta: Music is medicine, music is san@@ ity.
One day, Los Angeles Times colum@@ n@@ ist Steve L@@ ope@@ z was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music.
And the source was a man, an African-American man, char@@ ming, rug@@ g@@ ed, homel@@ ess, playing a viol@@ in that only had two str@@ ings.
And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Ste@@ ve@@ 's colum@@ ns became the basis for a book, which was turned into a movie, with Robert Do@@ w@@ ney J@@ r. acting as Steve L@@ ope@@ z, and Jamie Fo@@ x@@ x as Nath@@ ani@@ el Anth@@ ony Ay@@ ers, the Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained double b@@ ass@@ ist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic af@@ flic@@ tion with par@@ ano@@ id schizophren@@ ia.
Nath@@ ani@@ el dropped out of Ju@@ illi@@ ard, he suffered a complete break@@ down, and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of S@@ kid Ro@@ w in downtown Los Angeles.
I encourage all of you to read Ste@@ ve@@ 's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bon@@ d that formed between these two men, but how music helped shape that bon@@ d, and ultimately was instrument@@ al - if you'll par@@ don the pu@@ n - in helping Nath@@ ani@@ el get off the streets.
I met Mr. Ay@@ ers in 2008, two years ago, at Wal@@ t Disney Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all.
He had just heard a performance of Beetho@@ ven@@ 's First and Four@@ th sym@@ phon@@ ies, and came back@@ stage and introduced himself.
He was speaking in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and greg@@ ari@@ ous way about Y@@ o-@@ Y@@ o M@@ a and Hil@@ lary Clinton and how the Dod@@ gers were never going to make the World Ser@@ ies, all because of the tre@@ acher@@ ous first viol@@ in pass@@ age work in the last movement of Beetho@@ ven@@ 's Four@@ th Sym@@ phon@@ y.
And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nath@@ ani@@ el was interested in a viol@@ in lesson with me.
Now, I should mention that Nath@@ ani@@ el ref@@ uses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Th@@ or@@ az@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s, and that s@@ car has stayed with him for his entire life.
But as a result now, he is pr@@ one to these schizophren@@ ic epis@@ od@@ es, the worst of which can manif@@ est themselves as him explod@@ ing and then disappear@@ ing for days, wandering the streets of S@@ kid Ro@@ w, exposed to its horr@@ ors, with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ ashed upon him.
And Nath@@ ani@@ el was in such a state of ag@@ itation when we started our first lesson at Wal@@ t Disney Con@@ cer@@ t Hall - he had a kind of man@@ ic g@@ lin@@ t in his eyes, he was lost.
And he was talking about invisible demon@@ s and smo@@ ke, and how someone was poison@@ ing him in his sleep.
And I was afr@@ aid, not for myself, but I was afraid that I was going to lose him, that he was going to sink into one of his states, and that I would ru@@ in his relationship with the viol@@ in if I started talking about scales and ar@@ peg@@ gios and other exciting forms of did@@ ac@@ tic viol@@ in ped@@ agog@@ y.
So, I just started play@@ ing.
And I played the first movement of the Beetho@@ ven Viol@@ in Con@@ certo.
And as I play@@ ed, I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nath@@ ani@@ el@@ 's eyes.
It was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some invisible pharmaceu@@ tic@@ al, a chemical reac@@ tion, for which my playing the music was its cat@@ al@@ yst@@ .
And Nath@@ ani@@ el@@ 's man@@ ic r@@ age was transformed into understanding, a quiet curiosity and grac@@ e.
And in a mirac@@ le, he lifted his own viol@@ in and he started play@@ ing, by ear, certain sni@@ p@@ pets of viol@@ in concer@@ tos which he then asked me to complete - M@@ end@@ el@@ s@@ so@@ h@@ n, T@@ cha@@ ik@@ ov@@ sky, Si@@ beli@@ us.
And we started talking about music, from B@@ ach to Beetho@@ ven and Bra@@ h@@ ms, Br@@ uck@@ ner, all the B@@ 's, from Bar@@ tó@@ k, all the way up to E@@ sa@@ -@@ Pe@@ k@@ ka Sal@@ on@@ en.
And I understood that he not only had an encyclo@@ pedi@@ c knowledge of music, but he related to this music at a personal level.
He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Ph@@ ilh@@ ar@@ mon@@ ic.
And through playing music and talking about music, this man had transformed from the par@@ ano@@ id, dist@@ ur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the char@@ ming, er@@ udi@@ te, brilli@@ ant, Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained musici@@ an.
Music is medicine. Music changes us.
And for Nath@@ ani@@ el, music is san@@ ity.
Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delus@@ ions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity, into reality.
And that is an escape from his tor@@ mented state.
And I understood that this was the very essence of art.
This was the very reason why we made music, that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental co@@ re, our emotions, and through our artistic l@@ ens, through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.
And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us, inspi@@ res and uni@@ tes us.
And for Nath@@ ani@@ el, music brought him back into a fold of friends.
The re@@ dem@@ p@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him, that recognized his talents and respec@@ ted him.
And I will always make music with Nath@@ ani@@ el, whether we're at Wal@@ t Disney Con@@ cer@@ t Hall or on S@@ kid Ro@@ w, because he reminds me why I became a musici@@ an.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks.

Robert G@@ up@@ ta: I'm going to play something that I sham@@ el@@ essly st@@ ole from cell@@ ists.
So, please forgive me.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: G@@ ames like World of War@@ craft give players the means to save worl@@ ds, and incentive to learn the habits of hero@@ es. What if we could harness this gam@@ er power to solve real-@@ world problem@@ s? Jane Mc@@ Gon@@ ig@@ al says we can, and explains how.
Jane Mc@@ Gon@@ ig@@ al: G@@ aming can make a better world.
I'm Jane Mc@@ Gon@@ ig@@ al. I'm a game designer.
I've been making games online now for 10 years, and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games.
Now, I have a plan for this, and it ent@@ ails convincing more people, including all of you, to spend more time playing bigger and better games.
Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games.
Some of you might be thinking, "That's a lot of time to spend playing games.
Maybe too much time, considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world."
But actually, according to my research at the Institute for the Fu@@ ture, actually the opposite is true.
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems.
In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increase that total dramatic@@ ally.
I've calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week.
So, that's probably a bit of a counter-@@ intuitive idea, so I'll say it again, let it sink in: If we want to solve problems like hun@@ ger, poverty, climate change, global conflict, obes@@ ity, I believe that we need to aspir@@ e to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week, by the end of the next decade.
No. I'm serious. I am.
Here's why.
This picture pretty much sum@@ s up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species. Tr@@ ul@@ y.
This is a portrait by photographer P@@ hi@@ l To@@ led@@ ano.
He wanted to capture the emotion of gam@@ ing, so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were play@@ ing.
And this is a classic gam@@ ing emotion.
Now, if you're not a gam@@ er, you might miss some of the nu@@ ance in this pho@@ to.
You probably see the sense of ur@@ genc@@ y, a little bit of fear, but intense concentr@@ ation, deep, deep focus on tack@@ ling a really difficult problem.
If you are a gam@@ er, you will notice a few nu@@ ances here: the cr@@ ink@@ le of the eyes up, and around the mouth is a sign of optim@@ ism, and the eye@@ bro@@ ws up is surprise.
This is a gam@@ er who's on the ver@@ ge of something called an "@@ e@@ pic win@@ ."
Oh, you've heard of that.
OK, good, so we have some gam@@ ers among us.
An e@@ pic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive, you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it.
It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination, and when you get there, you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of. That's an e@@ pic win.
This is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pic win.
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem@@ -@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century - the face of someone who, against all od@@ ds, is on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pic win.
Now, unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems.
This is what I call the "I'm Not Good At Life@@ " face.
This is actually me making it. Can you see? Yes. Good.
This is me making the "I'm Not Good At Life@@ " face.
This is a piece of graf@@ fit@@ i in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California, where I did my Ph@@ D on why we're better in games than we are in real life.
And this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have.
We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games.
I don't mean just good as in successful, although that's part of it.
We do achieve more in game world@@ s.
But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters - inspired to collaborate and to cooper@@ ate.
And when we're in game worl@@ ds, I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves - the most likely to help at a moment@@ 's notice, the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it tak@@ es, to get up after failure and try again.
And in real life, when we face failure, when we confront obstac@@ les, we often don't feel that way.
We feel over@@ come, we feel overwhel@@ med, we feel anxi@@ ous, maybe depres@@ sed, frustrated or cy@@ nic@@ al.
We never have those feelings when we're playing games, they just don't exist in games.
So that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student.
What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve every@@ thing?
How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-@@ world work?
So I looked at games like World of War@@ craf@@ t, which is really the ideal collaborative problem@@ -@@ solving environment.
And I started to notice a few things that make e@@ pic win@@ s so possible in online world@@ s.
The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games, especially in World of War@@ craf@@ t, there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world-@@ saving mission, right away.
But not just any mission, it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game.
Right? So you can do it.
They never give you a challenge you can't achie@@ ve.
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you're capable of, so you have to try hard.
But there's no unemploy@@ ment in World of War@@ craf@@ t; no sitting around, there's always something specific and important to be done.
There are also tons of collabor@@ ators.
Every@@ where you go, hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your e@@ pic mission.
That's not something we have in real life that eas@@ ily, this sense that at our finger@@ tips are tons of collabor@@ ators.
And there's this e@@ pic story, this inspiring story of why we're there, and what we're doing, and we get all this positive feedback.
You guys have heard of level@@ ing up, +@@ 1 streng@@ th, +@@ 1 intelligence.
We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life.
When I get off this stage, I'm not going to have +@@ 1 speaking, and +@@ 1 crazy idea, +@@ 20 crazy idea.
I don't get that feedback in real life.
Now, the problem with collaborative online environments like World of War@@ craft is that it's so satis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pic win all the time, we decide to spend all our time in these game world@@ s.
It's just better than reality.
So, so far, collectively all the World of War@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5.@@ 9@@ 3 million years solving the virtual problems of A@@ zer@@ o@@ th.
Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
It might sound like it's a bad thing.
But to put that in contex@@ t: 5.@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our earliest pri@@ mate human ancestors stood up.
That was the first upr@@ ight pri@@ mate.
So when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games, the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing.
But it's also ap@@ t, because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games, we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings.
We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hear@@ ty species.
This is true. I believe this.
So, consider this really interesting statis@@ tic@@ ; it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mell@@ on Univers@@ ity: The average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21.
Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States, 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school, from fifth grade to high school gradu@@ ation, if you have perfect attend@@ ance.
So, we have an entire parallel track of education going on, where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they're learning about everything else in school.
Some of you have probably read Malcolm G@@ lad@@ well@@ 's new book "O@@ ut@@ li@@ er@@ s," so you would have heard of his theory of success, the "@@ 10,000 hour@@ s" theory of success.
It's based on this great cogni@@ ti@@ ve-@@ science research that says if we can master 10,000 hours of ef@@ fort@@ ful study at anything by the age of 21, we will be virtu@@ osos at it.
We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world.
And so, now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ oso g@@ amer@@ s.
So, the big question is, "What exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at@@ ?"
Because if we could figure that out, we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands.
This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games.
These are our virtu@@ oso g@@ amer@@ s, 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something.
And in the next decade, we're going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is.
If you don't know it already, this is coming.
The game industry is developing con@@ so@@ les that are low-@@ energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broad@@ band Internet, so that gam@@ ers all over the world, particularly in India, China, Brazil, can get online.
They expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decade.
It will bring us up to 1.5 billion g@@ amer@@ s.
So I've started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ osos at.
Here are the four things I came up with. The first is urgent optim@@ ism.
OK, think of this as extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ation.
Ur@@ g@@ ent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstac@@ le, combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success.
Gam@@ ers always believe that an e@@ pic win is possible, and that it's always worth tr@@ ying, and trying now.
Gam@@ ers don't sit around.
Gam@@ ers are virtu@@ osos at we@@ aving a tight social fabric@@ .
There's a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them, even if they've beaten us bad@@ ly.
And the reason is, it takes a lot of trust to play a game with some@@ one.
We trust that they will spend their time with us, that they will play by the same rules, value the same goal, stay with the game until it's over.
And so, playing a game together actually builds up bon@@ ds and trust and cooper@@ ation.
And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result.
B@@ lis@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tivity. I love it.
You know, there's a reason why the average World of War@@ craft gam@@ er plays for 22 hours a week - kind of a half-@@ time job.
It's because we know, when we're playing a game, that we're actually happier working hard than we are relax@@ ing, or hanging out.
We know that we are optim@@ ized as human beings, to do hard and meaningful work.
And gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time, if they're given the right work.
Fin@@ all@@ y: e@@ pic meaning.
Gam@@ ers love to be attached to a@@ we@@ -@@ inspiring missions to human planet@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories.
So, just one bit of tri@@ via that helps put that into perspec@@ ti@@ ve: So, you all know Wikipedia, biggest wi@@ ki in the world.
Second biggest wi@@ ki in the world, with nearly 80,000 artic@@ les, is the World of War@@ craft wi@@ k@@ i.
Five million people use it every month.
They have comp@@ iled more information about World of War@@ craft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wi@@ ki in the world.
They are building an e@@ pic story.
They are building an e@@ pic knowledge resource about the World of War@@ craf@@ t.
Okay, so these are four super@@ powers that add up to one thing: Gam@@ ers are super-@@ empowered hopeful individuals.
These are people who believe that they are individ@@ ually capable of changing the world.
And the only problem is, they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world.
That's the problem that I'm trying to sol@@ ve.
There's an economist named Edward C@@ astron@@ ov@@ a.
His work is brilli@@ ant.
He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online world@@ s.
And he says, "We're wit@@ ness@@ ing what amounts to no less than a mass ex@@ od@@ us to virtual worlds and online game environment@@ s."
And he's an econom@@ ist, so he's ration@@ al.
And he says - Not like me, I'm a game desig@@ ner@@ ; I'm exuber@@ ant.
But he says that this makes perfect sense, because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life.
They can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life@@ ; they get better feedback and feel more rewar@@ ded in games than they do in real life.
So he says, for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world.
Now, I also agree that that is ration@@ al, for now.
But it is not, by any means, an op@@ ti@@ mal situation.
We have to start making the real world work more like a game.
I take my inspiration from something that happened 2,@@ 500 years ago.
These are ancient dic@@ e, made out of she@@ ep@@ 's k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les.
Before we had awesome game control@@ l@@ ers, we had she@@ ep@@ 's k@@ nuc@@ k@@ les.
And these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings, and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek histori@@ an Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us, you might know this history, which is the history of who invented games and why.
Her@@ od@@ o@@ tus says that games, particularly dice games, were invented in the king@@ dom of Ly@@ dia, during a time of fam@@ ine.
Ap@@ par@@ ently, there was such a severe fam@@ ine that the king of Ly@@ dia decided they had to do something crazy.
People were suffering. People were figh@@ ting.
It was an extreme situation, they needed an extreme solution.
So, according to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us, they invented dice games, and they set up a king@@ do@@ m-@@ wide polic@@ y: On one day, everybody would eat, and on the next day, everybody would play games.
And they would be so immer@@ sed in playing the dice games, because games are so engag@@ ing, and immer@@ se us in such satisf@@ ying, bl@@ iss@@ ful produc@@ tivity, they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat.
And then on the next day, they would play gam@@ es; and on the next day, they would eat.
And according to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us, they passed 18 years this way, surviv@@ ing through a fam@@ ine, by eating on one day, and playing games on the next.
Now, this is exac@@ tly, I think, how we're using games today.
We're using games to escape real-@@ world suffering - we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment, everything that's not satis@@ fying about real life, and we're getting what we need from games.
But it doesn't have to end there.
This is really exciting.
According to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us, after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn't getting better, so the king decided they would play one final dice game.
They divided the entire king@@ dom in half.
They played one dice game, and the win@@ ners of that game got to go on an e@@ pic advent@@ ure.
They would leave Ly@@ dia, and they would go out in search of a new place to live, leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available, and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thri@@ ve.
Now, this sounds crazy, right?
But recently, DNA evidence has shown that the E@@ trus@@ can@@ s, who then led to the Roman Em@@ pi@@ re, actually share the same DNA as the ancient Ly@@ di@@ ans.
And so, recently, scientists have suggested that Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us@@ ' crazy story is actually true.
And ge@@ ologists have found evidence of a global cooling that las@@ ted for nearly 20 years, that could have explained the fam@@ ine.
So this crazy story might be true.
They might have actually saved their culture by playing games, escap@@ ing to games for 18 years, and then been so inspi@@ red, and knew so much about how to come together with games, that they actually saved the entire civilization that way.
Okay, we can do that.
We've been playing War@@ craft since 199@@ 4.
That was the first real-time strategy game from the World of War@@ craft seri@@ es.
That was 16 years ago.
They played dice games for 18 years, we've been playing War@@ craft for 16 years.
I say we are ready for our own e@@ pic game.
Now, they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world, so that's where I get my 21 billion hours a week of gam@@ e-@@ play from.
Let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games, until we solve real-@@ world problems.
Now, I know you're asking, "How are we going to solve real-@@ world problems in gam@@ es?"
Well, that's what I've devoted my work to over the past few years, at the Institute for the Fu@@ ture.
We have this ban@@ ner in our offices in Pal@@ o Al@@ to, and it ex@@ pr@@ esses our view of how we should try to relate to the future.
We do not want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is make the future.
We want to imagine the best-@@ case scenario out@@ come, and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality.
We want to imagine e@@ pic win@@ s, and then give people the means to achieve the e@@ pic win.
I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create e@@ pic win@@ s in their own futur@@ es.
This is World Without O@@ il.
We made this game in 2007.
This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil short@@ age.
The oil short@@ age is fic@@ tion@@ al, but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real, and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil. So when you come to the game, you sign up, tell us where you live, and then we give you real-time news videos, data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs, what's not available, how food supply is being affec@@ ted.
How transportation is being affec@@ ted, if schools are clos@@ ed, if there's ri@@ ot@@ ing, and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true. And then we ask you to blog about it, to post videos, to post pho@@ tos.
We pilo@@ ted this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007, and we've trac@@ ked them for the three years since.
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience.
Nobody wants to change how they live, just because it's good for the world, or because we're supposed to.
But if you immer@@ se them in an e@@ pic adventure and tell them, "@@ We've run out of oil.
This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on.
Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge yourself to see how you would survi@@ ve@@ ," most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game.
So for the next world-@@ saving game, we decided to aim higher - bigger problem than just peak oil.
We did a game called Super@@ struc@@ t at the Institute for the Fu@@ ture.
And the premise was, a super@@ computer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet.
This super@@ computer was called the Global Ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion A@@ war@@ eness Sys@@ tem, of course.
We asked people to come online - almost like a Jerry Br@@ uck@@ heim@@ er movie.
You know Jerry Br@@ uck@@ heim@@ er movies, you form a dream team - you've got the astronaut@@ , the scientist, the ex-@@ convic@@ t, and they all have something to do to save the world.
But in our game, instead of just having five people on the dream team, we said, "@@ Every@@ body's on the dream team, and it's your job to invent the future of energy, the future of food, the future of health, the future of security and the future of the social safety net@@ ."
We had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks.
They came up with 500 insan@@ ely creative solutions that you can go online, Google "@@ Super@@ struc@@ t@@ ," and see.
So, finally, the last game, we're launching it March 3@@ r@@ d. This is a game done with the World Bank Institu@@ te.
If you complete the game, you will be certi@@ fied by the World Bank Institute as a Social Innov@@ ator, class of 2010.
Wor@@ king with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa, and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills.
We've got a graphic no@@ vel, we've got level@@ ing up in skills like local ins@@ ight, knowledge net@@ working, sustain@@ ability, vision and res@@ ource@@ ful@@ ness.
I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people, anywhere in the world, particularly in developing areas, who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterpris@@ es to save the world.
So, I'm going to wrap up now.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think happens next?
We've got all these amazing g@@ amer@@ s, we've got these games that are kind of pilo@@ ts of what we might do, but none of them have saved the real world yet.
Well I hope you will agree with me that gam@@ ers are a human resource that we can use to do real-@@ world work, that games are a powerful platform for change.
We have all these amazing super@@ power@@ s: bl@@ iss@@ ful produc@@ tivity, the ability to we@@ ave a tight social fabric@@ , this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for e@@ pic meaning.
I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter, to survive on this planet for another century.
That's my hope, that you will join me in making and playing games like this.
When I look forward to the next decade, I know two things for su@@ re: that we can make any future we can imagine, and we can play any games we want, so I say: Let the world-@@ changing games beg@@ in.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Sug@@ ar pill@@ s, injec@@ tions of nothing - studies show that, more often than you'd expec@@ t, placeb@@ os really work. At TEDME@@ D, magici@@ an Eric Me@@ ad does a trick to prove that, even when you know some@@ thing's not real, you can still react as power@@ fully as if it is.
Eric Me@@ ad@@ : The magic of the placeb@@ o.
For some time I have been interested in the placeb@@ o effect, which might seem like an odd thing for a magici@@ an to be interested in, unless you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, "@@ Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real@@ ."
In other words, sugar p@@ ills have a measur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studies, the placeb@@ o effect, just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a - for pain manag@@ ement, for example, if they believe it enough there is a measur@@ able effect in the body called the placeb@@ o effect.
Something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it.
In order for us to understand each other, I want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary, very simple magic tric@@ k.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950@@ s.
I learned it myself from Cu@@ b Sco@@ ut Mag@@ ic in the 197@@ 0s.
I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it.
And then I'll explain why I explained it.
So, here's what happens.
The kni@@ f@@ e, which you can exam@@ ine@@ ; my hand, which you could exam@@ ine.
I'm just going to hold the knife in my f@@ ist like this.
I'll get my sle@@ eve back.
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve I'm just going to squee@@ ze my w@@ ris@@ t right here.
That way you can see that at no time can anything travel, as long as I'm squee@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve.
And the object of this is quite simple.
I'm going to open my hand, and hope@@ fully, if all is well, my pure animal magne@@ tis@@ m will hold the kni@@ f@@ e.
In fact it's held so tightly in place that I can shake it, and the knife does not come off.
Nothing goes up or down my sle@@ ev@@ e, no trick@@ ery. And you can examine everything.
T@@ a-@@ d@@ a!
So, this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in mag@@ ic, because you can learn a great deal about decep@@ tion by studying this very - even though it's a very simple trick method@@ olog@@ ically.
Probably many of you in the room know this tric@@ k.
What happens is this.
I hold the knife in my hand.
I say I'm going to grab hold of my w@@ ris@@ t to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ ev@@ e, that is a li@@ e.
The reason I'm holding onto my w@@ ris@@ t is because that's actually the secret of the illus@@ ion.
In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you, this finger right here, my inde@@ x finger is just going to shift from where it is, to a position pointing out like this.
N@@ ice one.
Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there.
So, it goes like this, from here, right.
And as I move around my finger shif@@ ts.
And we could talk about why this is decep@@ tive, why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here, because the mind, and the way it processes information, it doesn't coun@@ t, one, two, three. It groups them.
But that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up.
Obviously it's cl@@ inging there, not by animal magne@@ tis@@ m, but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ery, my inde@@ x finger being there.
And then when I close my finger, same thing, as I move back, this motion kind of covers the moving back of my fing@@ er.
I take this hand away. You give the knife out.
There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbor@@ s. Thanks.
Now, what does that have to do with the placeb@@ o effec@@ t?
I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open.
I'm not a doctor or a research@@ er, so this, to me, was an astonishing thing.
It turns out that if you ad@@ minister a placeb@@ o in the form of a white p@@ ill, that's like aspir@@ in shaped - it's just a round white p@@ ill - it has some certain measur@@ able effect.
But if you change the form that you give the placeb@@ o in, like you make a smaller p@@ ill, and color it blue, and stam@@ p a letter into it, it is actually measur@@ ably more effective.
Even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical - they're sugar pill@@ s.
But a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill.
Wh@@ at? That really fli@@ pped me out.
Turns out though, that that's not even where it stop@@ s.
If you have capsul@@ es, they're more effective than tab@@ lets in any form.
A colored cap@@ su@@ le, that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le.
D@@ os@@ age has something to do with this.
One p@@ ill twice a day is not as good at three p@@ ills - I don't remember the stati@@ stic now. Sorr@@ y.
But the point is ...
... these dos@@ ages have something to do with it.
And the form has something to do with it.
And if you want the ultimate in placeb@@ o, you've go to the need@@ le.
Right? A syring@@ e with some in@@ ert - a couple C@@ Cs of some in@@ ert something, and you injec@@ t this into a patient ...
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind, it's so much stronger than the white p@@ ill.
It's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to you some other time when we have slides.
The point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the capsul@@ e is not as good as the need@@ le.
And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality, it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect.
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic tric@@ k.
And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real.
And we know from that study that when you want reality, you go to the need@@ le.
This is a seven-@@ inch hat@@ pin@@ . It's very, very shar@@ p, and I'm going to just ster@@ il@@ ize it a tiny bit.
This is really my fl@@ es@@ h. This is not D@@ ami@@ an's speci@@ al-@@ grown fl@@ es@@ h.
That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect.
I'm going to pi@@ er@@ ce my skin and run this needle through to the other side.
If you're que@@ as@@ y - if you f@@ aint easily - I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know, and one woman almost passed out.
So, I suggest if you get que@@ as@@ y easy that you look away for about the next 30 - in fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it.
You'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to.
So, here is what happens, right here, the beginning of my fl@@ esh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce.
I'm sorry, man. Am I fre@@ aking you out?
OK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit, and then out the other side like this.
Now, essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife tric@@ k.
Sor@@ t of.
But you can't count my fingers right now can you?
So, let me show them to you. That's one, two three, four, five.
Yes, well@@ ...
I know what people think when they see this.
They go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enough to sta@@ b himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes.
So, let me give you a little pe@@ e@@ k.
Ho@@ w's that look out there? Pretty good.
Yeah, I know. And the people in the back go, "OK, I didn't really see that."
People in the satellite room are starting to move in now.
Let me give you good close look at this.
That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect.
That's my fl@@ es@@ h, and I can tw@@ ist that around.
I'm sorry. If you're getting que@@ as@@ y, look away, don't look at the thing.
People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go, "Well yeah, that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be - see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be ble@@ ed@@ ing.
Well let me work up some blood for you.
Yes, there it is.
Norm@@ ally now, I would take the needle out.
I would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no w@@ ounds.
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real, I'm just going to leave it there, and walk off the stage.
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days.
I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Che@@ f Dan Bar@@ ber squ@@ ares off with a dilemma facing many chef@@ s today@@ : how to keep fish on the men@@ u. With im@@ pec@@ cable research and dead@@ p@@ an humor, he chron@@ ic@@ les his pursuit of a sustainable fish he could love, and the fo@@ odi@@ e's honey@@ moon he's enjoyed since discovering an outr@@ age@@ ously delici@@ ous fish raised using a revolutionary farming method in S@@ pain.
Dan Bar@@ ber@@ : How I fell in love with a fish.
So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.
I've loved only two.
That first one, it was more like a passionate af@@ fa@@ ir.
It was a beautiful fish@@ : fl@@ avor@@ ful, tex@@ ture@@ d, me@@ at@@ y, a best@@ sell@@ er on the men@@ u.
What a fish.
Even better, it was far@@ m-@@ raised to the supposed highest standards of sustain@@ ability.
So you could feel good about selling it.
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months.
One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the far@@ m@@ 's sustain@@ ability.
"A@@ b@@ solu@@ tel@@ y," I said.
Here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimagin@@ able problem for us chef@@ s: How do we keep fish on our men@@ us?
For the past 50 years, we've been fishing the seas like we clear@@ -@@ cut forests.
It's hard to over@@ state the destruc@@ tion.
Nin@@ ety percent of large fish, the ones we love - the tun@@ as, the h@@ ali@@ but@@ s, the sal@@ mon@@ s, s@@ word@@ fish - they've collap@@ sed.
There's almost nothing left.
So, for better or for worse, aqu@@ acul@@ ture, fish far@@ ming, is going to be a part of our future.
A lot of arguments against it: F@@ ish farms pollut@@ e - most of them do any@@ way - and they're in@@ efficient. Take tun@@ a, a major draw@@ back.
It's got a feed conver@@ sion ratio of 15 to one.
That means it takes fif@@ teen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tun@@ a.
Not very sustainable.
It doesn't taste very good either.
So here, finally, was a company trying to do it right.
I wanted to support them.
The day before the event, I called the head of P@@ .@@ R. for the company.
Let's call him D@@ on.
"@@ Don@@ ," I said, "@@ just to get the facts stra@@ ight, you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollu@@ te."
"That's right@@ ," he said. "We're so far out, the waste from our fish gets distribu@@ ted, not concentr@@ ate@@ d."
And then he ad@@ ded, "We're basically a world un@@ to ourselves.
That feed conver@@ sion rati@@ o? 2.5 to one@@ ," he said.
"B@@ est in the business@@ ."
2.5 to one, great.
"@@ 2.5 what? What are you feed@@ ing?"
"S@@ us@@ tain@@ able prote@@ ins@@ ," he said.
"@@ Gre@@ at@@ ," I said. Go@@ t off the phone.
And that night, I was lying in bed, and I though@@ t: What the hell is a sustainable prote@@ in?
So the next day, just before the event, I called D@@ on.
I said, "D@@ on, what are some examples of sustainable prote@@ ins@@ ?"
He said he didn't know. He would ask around.
Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company@@ ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally, I got on the phone with the head biolog@@ ist.
Let's call him Don too.
"@@ Don@@ ," I said, "@@ what are some examples of sustainable prote@@ ins@@ ?"
Well, he mentioned some alg@@ a@@ es and some fish me@@ als, and then he said chicken pel@@ le@@ ts.
I said, "@@ Ch@@ ick@@ en pel@@ let@@ s?"
He said, "Yeah, fea@@ ther@@ s, skin, bone me@@ al, scr@@ ap@@ s, dri@@ ed and processed into feed@@ ."
I said, "What percentage of your feed is chick@@ en@@ ?"
Th@@ in@@ king, you know, two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent@@ ," he said.
I said, "D@@ on, what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish@@ ?"
There was a long pause on the line, and he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world."
I fell out of love with this fish.
No, not because I'm some self-@@ righ@@ te@@ ous, good@@ y-@@ two shoes fo@@ odi@@ e.
I actually am.
No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swe@@ ar to God, after that conversation, the fish tas@@ ted like chick@@ en.
This second fish, it's a different kind of love story.
It's the romantic kind, the kind where the more you get to know your fish, you love the fish.
I first ate it at a restaurant in southern S@@ pain.
A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.
She kind of set us up.
It came to the table a brigh@@ t, almost sh@@ immer@@ ing, white color.
The chef had over@@ coo@@ ked it.
Like twice over.
Amaz@@ ingly, it was still delici@@ ous.
Who can make a fish taste good after it's been over@@ cook@@ ed?
I can@@ 't, but this guy can.
Let's call him Migu@@ el - actually his name is Migu@@ el.
And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef@@ , at least in the way that you and I understand it.
He's a biologist at V@@ eta La Pal@@ ma.
It's a fish farm in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of S@@ pain.
It's at the tip of the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vir river.
Until the 198@@ 0s, the farm was in the hands of the Argent@@ ini@@ ans.
They raised be@@ ef cat@@ tle on what was essentially wet@@ lands.
They did it by dr@@ ain@@ ing the land.
They built this intric@@ ate series of can@@ als, and they pushed water off the land and out into the river.
Well, they couldn't make it work, not econom@@ ically.
And ecolog@@ ically, it was a disaster.
It killed like 90 percent of the birds, which, for this place, is a lot of birds.
And so in 198@@ 2, a Spanish company with an environmental consci@@ ence purchas@@ ed the land.
What did they do?
They rever@@ sed the flow of water.
They literally fli@@ pped the swit@@ ch.
Instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to pull water back in.
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als.
They created a 2@@ 7@@ ,000-@@ acre fish farm - bas@@ s, mul@@ let, shrim@@ p, e@@ el - and in the process, Migu@@ el and this company completely rever@@ sed the ecological destruc@@ tion.
The far@@ m@@ 's incredible.
I mean, you've never seen anything like this.
You stare out at a horiz@@ on that is a million miles away, and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ick, rich marsh@@ land.
I was there not long ago with Migu@@ el.
He's an amazing guy, like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Cro@@ codi@@ le Dun@@ de@@ e.
Okay? There we are slog@@ ging through the wet@@ lands, and I'm p@@ ant@@ ing and swe@@ ating, got mud up to my kne@@ es, and Migu@@ el@@ 's cal@@ m@@ ly conduc@@ ting a biology lec@@ ture.
Here, he's pointing out a rare Black@@ -@@ shoul@@ der@@ ed Ki@@ te.
Now, he's mention@@ ing the min@@ eral needs of phy@@ to@@ plank@@ ton.
And here, here he sees a grou@@ ping pattern that reminds him of the Tanz@@ ani@@ an Gir@@ af@@ f@@ e.
It turns out, Migu@@ el spent the better part of his career in the Mik@@ um@@ i National Park in Africa.
I asked him how he became such an expert on fish.
He said, "F@@ ish@@ ? I didn't know anything about fish.
I'm an expert in relationshi@@ p@@ s."
And then he's off, launching into more talk about rare birds and alg@@ a@@ es and strange aqu@@ atic plants.
And don't get me wrong, that was really fascin@@ ating, you know, the bio@@ tic community un@@ plug@@ g@@ ed, kind of thing.
It's great, but I was in love.
And my head was s@@ wo@@ on@@ ing over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of delici@@ ous fish I had the night before.
So I interrup@@ ted him. I said, "M@@ igu@@ el, what makes your fish taste so good@@ ?"
He pointed at the alg@@ ae.
"I know, du@@ de, the alg@@ ae, the phy@@ to@@ plank@@ ton, the relationshi@@ p@@ s: It's amazing.
But what are your fish e@@ ating@@ ?
What's the feed conver@@ sion rati@@ o?"
Well, he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild.
The plant biom@@ as@@ s, the phy@@ to@@ plank@@ ton, the zo@@ o@@ plank@@ ton, it's what feeds the fish.
The system is so healthy, it's totally self-@@ renew@@ ing.
There is no fe@@ ed.
E@@ ver heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animal@@ s?
L@@ ater that day, I was driving around this property with Migu@@ el, and I asked him, I said, "@@ For a place that seems so natural, unlike like any farm I'd ever been at, how do you measure success@@ ?"
At that moment, it was as if a film director called for a set change.
And we r@@ ounded the corner and saw the most amazing sigh@@ t: thousands and thousands of pink flam@@ ing@@ os, a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.
"That's success@@ ," he said.
"@@ Look at their bel@@ li@@ es, pin@@ k.
They're fe@@ ast@@ ing."
F@@ eas@@ t@@ ing? I was totally confu@@ sed.
I said, "M@@ igu@@ el, aren't they fe@@ as@@ ting on your fish@@ ?"
"Y@@ es," he said.
"We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds.
Well, last year, this property had 6@@ 00,000 birds on it, more than 250 different species.
It's be@@ come, today, the largest and one of the most important private bird sanc@@ tu@@ aries in all of Europe@@ ."
I said, "M@@ igu@@ el, isn't a thri@@ ving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish far@@ m@@ ?"
He sho@@ ok his head, no.
He said, "We farm extensi@@ vely, not intensi@@ vely.
This is an ecological network.
The flam@@ ing@@ os eat the shrim@@ p.
The shrimp eat the phy@@ to@@ plank@@ ton.
So the pin@@ ker the bell@@ y, the better the system@@ ."
Okay, so let's re@@ view@@ : a farm that doesn't feed its animals, and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predat@@ ors.
A fish far@@ m, but also a bird sanc@@ tu@@ ary.
Oh, and by the way, those flam@@ ing@@ os, they shouldn't even be there in the first place.
They bro@@ od in a town 150 miles away, where the soil conditions are better for building nest@@ s.
Every morning, they fly 150 miles into the far@@ m.
And every evening, they fly 150 miles back.
They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of high@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2.
No kid@@ ding.
I was imagining a "@@ March of the Pen@@ gu@@ ins@@ " thing, so I looked at Migu@@ el.
I said, "M@@ igu@@ el, do they fly 150 miles to the far@@ m, and then do they fly 150 miles back at nigh@@ t?
Do they do that for the childr@@ en@@ ?"
He looked at me like I had just quo@@ ted a Whit@@ ney Houst@@ on song.
He said, "No@@ ; they do it because the food@@ 's bet@@ ter."
I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish, which was delici@@ ous - and I don't like fish skin@@ ; I don't like it sear@@ ed, I don't like it cris@@ p@@ y.
It's that acr@@ id, tar@@ -like flav@@ or.
I almost never cook with it.
Yet, when I tas@@ ted it at that restaurant in southern S@@ pain, it tas@@ ted not at all like fish skin.
It tas@@ ted sweet and cle@@ an, like you were taking a bite of the ocean.
I mentioned that to Migu@@ el, and he no@@ d@@ ded.
He said, "The skin acts like a spon@@ ge.
It's the last defense before anything enters the body.
It evolved to so@@ ak up im@@ puri@@ ti@@ es."
And then he ad@@ ded, "But our water has no im@@ puri@@ ti@@ es."
OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish, a farm that measures its success by the success of its predat@@ ors.
And then I realized when he says, "A farm that has no im@@ puri@@ ti@@ es," he made a big underst@@ atem@@ ent, because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vir Ri@@ ver.
It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these day@@ s: chemical contamin@@ ants, pes@@ tici@@ de run@@ off.
And when it works its way through the system and leav@@ es, the water is clean@@ er than when it enter@@ ed.
The system is so healthy, it puri@@ fies the water.
So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals, not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predat@@ ors, but a farm that's literally a water puri@@ fication plant - and not just for those fish, but for you and me as well.
Because when that water leav@@ es, it dum@@ ps out into the Atlan@@ tic.
A drop in the ocean, I know, but I'll take it, and so should you, because this love story, however roman@@ tic, is also instruc@@ tive.
You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food, whether we're talking about bas@@ s or be@@ ef c@@ att@@ le.
What we need now is a radically new concep@@ tion of agriculture, one in which the food actually tas@@ tes good.
But for a lot people, that's a bit too radical.
We're not real@@ ists, us fo@@ odi@@ es; we're lo@@ vers.
We love far@@ mer@@ s' markets, we love small family far@@ ms, we talk about local food, we eat organ@@ ic.
And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food, someone, somewhere stands up and says, "H@@ ey guy, I love pink flam@@ ing@@ os, but how are you going to feed the world@@ ?"
How are you going to feed the world?
Can I be honest@@ ?
I don't love that question.
No, not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world.
One billion people will go hungry today.
One billion - that's more than ever before - because of gross inequal@@ ities in distribu@@ tion, not ton@@ n@@ age.
Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years.
Fe@@ ed grain to her@@ bi@@ v@@ ores, pestic@@ ides to mon@@ ocul@@ tures, chemicals to soil, chicken to fish, and all along ag@@ ri@@ business has simply asked, "If we're feeding more people more che@@ apl@@ y, how terrible could that be@@ ?"
That's been the motiv@@ ation, it's been the justi@@ fic@@ ation: it's been the business plan of American agriculture.
We should call it what it is: a business in liqu@@ id@@ ation, a business that's quickly er@@ od@@ ing ecological capital that makes that very production possible.
That's not a business, and it isn't agriculture.
Our bread@@ bas@@ ket is threatened today, not because of dimin@@ ishing supply, but because of dimin@@ ishing resources.
Not by the latest combine and trac@@ tor inven@@ tion, but by fer@@ tile land@@ ; not by pum@@ ps, but by fresh water@@ ; not by chain@@ sa@@ ws, but by forest@@ s; and not by fishing boats and ne@@ ts, but by fish in the sea.
W@@ ant to feed the world?
Let's start by ask@@ ing: How are we going to feed ourselv@@ es?
Or bet@@ ter: How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed it@@ self@@ ?
To do that, don't look at the ag@@ ri@@ business model for the future.
It's really old, and it's ti@@ red.
It's high on capital, chemistry and machines, and it's never produced anything really good to eat.
Instead, let's look to the ecological model.
That's the one that reli@@ es on two billion years of on-@@ the-@@ job experience.
Look to Migu@@ el, farmers like Migu@@ el.
F@@ arms that aren't worlds un@@ to them@@ selv@@ es; farms that restore instead of deple@@ te; farms that farm extensi@@ vely instead of just intensi@@ vel@@ y; farmers that are not just produ@@ cer@@ s, but experts in relationships.
Because they're the ones that are experts in flav@@ or, too.
And if I'm going to be really honest, they're a better chef than I'll ever be.
You know, I'm okay with that, because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delici@@ ous.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: James Camer@@ on's big@@ -@@ budget films create un@@ real worlds all their own. In this personal talk, he reveals his childhood fascin@@ ation with the fantastic - from reading science fiction to deep-@@ sea diving - and how it ultimately drove the success of his block@@ bus@@ ter hits "A@@ li@@ ens@@ ," "The Termin@@ ator@@ ," "@@ Titan@@ ic@@ " and "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar."
James Camer@@ on: Before Av@@ atar ... a curious boy.
I grew up on a steady diet of science fic@@ tion.
In high school, I took a bus to school an hour each way every day.
And I was always absor@@ bed in a book, science fiction book, which took my mind to other worl@@ ds, and satis@@ fied, in a narrative form, this ins@@ ati@@ able sense of curiosity that I had.
And you know, that curiosity also manif@@ ested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school I was out in the wo@@ ods, hi@@ king and taking "@@ sam@@ pl@@ es" - fro@@ gs and sn@@ akes and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water - and bringing it back, looking at it under the microsco@@ pe.
You know, I was a real science gee@@ k.
But it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the limits of possibil@@ ity.
And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirr@@ or@@ ed in the world around me, because what was happening, this was in the late '60s, we were going to the moon, we were exploring the deep oceans.
Jac@@ ques C@@ ous@@ te@@ au was coming into our living rooms with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a won@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have previously imagin@@ ed.
So, that seemed to reson@@ ate with the whole science fiction part of it.
And I was an artist.
I could dra@@ w. I could pain@@ t.
And I found that because there weren't video games and this satur@@ ation of C@@ G movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape, I had to create these images in my head.
You know, we all did, as kids having to read a book, and through the author@@ 's descrip@@ tion, put something on the movie screen in our heads.
And so, my response to this was to pain@@ t, to draw alien creatures, alien worl@@ ds, robots, spaces@@ hi@@ ps, all that stuff.
I was end@@ lessly getting bus@@ ted in math class dood@@ ling behind the text@@ book.
That was - the creativity had to find its out@@ let some@@ how.
And an interesting thing happen@@ ed: The Jac@@ ques C@@ ous@@ te@@ au shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth.
I might not really go to an alien world on a spaces@@ hip someday - that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ lik@@ ely.
But that was a world I could really go to, right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books.
So, I decided I was going to become a s@@ cub@@ a di@@ ver at the age of 15.
And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada, 600 miles from the nearest ocean.
But I didn't let that da@@ un@@ t me.
I p@@ ester@@ ed my father until he finally found a s@@ cub@@ a class in Bu@@ f@@ fal@@ o, New York, right across the border from where we live.
And I actually got certi@@ fied in a pool at a Y@@ M@@ CA in the dead of winter in Bu@@ f@@ fal@@ o, New York.
And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean, for another two years, until we moved to California.
Since then, in the interven@@ ing 40 years, I've spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water, and 500 hours of that was in submer@@ sibl@@ es.
And I've learned that that deep-@@ ocean environment, and even the sh@@ allow oceans, are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination.
Nature@@ 's imagination is so bound@@ less compared to our own me@@ ager human imagination.
I still, to this day, stand in absolute a@@ we of what I see when I make these div@@ es.
And my love af@@ fair with the ocean is on@@ going, and just as strong as it ever was.
But when I chose a career as an adul@@ t, it was film@@ making.
And that seemed to be the best way to reconc@@ ile this urge I had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images.
And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.
So, film@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together, and that made sense.
And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stor@@ i@@ es: "@@ Termin@@ ator@@ ," "A@@ li@@ ens@@ " and "The Ab@@ ys@@ s."
And with "The Ab@@ ys@@ s," I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with film@@ making.
So, you know, mer@@ ging the two passi@@ ons.
Something interesting came out of "The Ab@@ ys@@ s," which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film, which was to create this kind of liquid water cre@@ ature, we actually embrac@@ ed computer generated anima@@ tion, C@@ G.
And this resul@@ ted in the first sof@@ t-@@ surface character, C@@ G animation that was ever in a movie.
And even though the film didn't make any money - barely broke even, I should say - I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience, the global audience, was mes@@ mer@@ ized by this appar@@ ent magic.
You know, it's Arthur Clar@@ k@@ e's law that any suffici@@ ently advanced technology is ind@@ ist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ able from magic.
They were seeing something mag@@ ical.
And so that got me very excited.
And I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embrac@@ ed into the cinema@@ tic art@@ ."
So, with "@@ Termin@@ ator 2@@ ," which was my next film, we took that much far@@ ther.
Wor@@ king with I@@ L@@ M, we created the liquid metal du@@ de in that film. The success hun@@ g in the balance on whether that effect would work.
And it did, and we created magic again, and we had the same result with an audience - although we did make a little more money on that one.
So, drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to, "This is going to be a whole new world@@ ," this was a whole new world of creativity for film artist@@ s.
So, I started a company with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on, my good friend St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on, who is the premi@@ er make@@ -up and creature designer at that time, and it was called Digital Do@@ ma@@ in.
And the concept of the company was that we would leap@@ frog past the analog processes of optical printer@@ s and so on, and we would go right to digital production.
And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we found ourselves lag@@ ging in the mi@@ d '90@@ s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do.
So, I wrote this piece called "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects, of C@@ G effects, beyon@@ d, with realistic human emo@@ tive characters generated in C@@ G, and the main characters would all be in C@@ G, and the world would be in C@@ G.
And the envelope pushed back, and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.
So, I shel@@ ved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks.
You know, I went and pit@@ ched it to the studio as "@@ '@@ Ro@@ me@@ o and Juli@@ et@@ ' on a ship@@ : "It's going to be this e@@ pic roman@@ ce, passionate film@@ ."
Secret@@ ly, what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wrec@@ k of "@@ Titan@@ ic@@ ."
And that's why I made the movie.
And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.
But I convinced them. I said, "We're going to dive to the wrec@@ k. We're going to film it for real.
We'll be using it in the opening of the film.
It will be really important. It will be a great marketing ho@@ ok@@ ."
And I talked them into funding an expedi@@ tion.
S@@ ounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality.
Because we actually created a reality where six months later, I find myself in a Russian submer@@ sible two and a half miles down in the north Atlan@@ tic, looking at the real Titan@@ ic through a view port@@ .
Not a movie, not H@@ D - for real.
Now, that blew my mind.
And it took a lot of prepar@@ ation, we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things.
But, it struck me how much this di@@ ve, these deep div@@ es, was like a space mission.
You know, where it was highly technic@@ al, and it required enormous plan@@ ning.
You get in this cap@@ su@@ le, you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself.
And I thought like, "Wo@@ w. I'm like, living in a science fiction movie.
This is really cool@@ ."
And so, I really got bit@@ ten by the bug of deep-@@ ocean exploration.
Of course, the curios@@ ity, the science component of it - it was everything. It was advent@@ ure, it was curios@@ ity, it was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me.
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that window.
As we did some of our subsequ@@ ent expedi@@ tions, I was seeing creatures at hydro@@ thermal v@@ ents and sometimes things that I had never seen before, sometimes things that no one had seen before, that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imag@@ ed them.
So, I was completely sm@@ it@@ ten by this, and had to do more.
And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.
After the success of "@@ Titan@@ ic@@ ," I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker, and I'm going to go be a full-time explor@@ er for a whi@@ le."
And so, we started planning these expedi@@ tions.
And we wound up going to the Bis@@ mark, and exploring it with robotic vehic@@ les.
We went back to the Titan@@ ic wrec@@ k.
We took little bo@@ ts that we had created that spo@@ o@@ led a fiber op@@ tic.
And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship, which had never been done.
Nobody had ever looked inside the wrec@@ k. They didn't have the means to do it, so we created technology to do it.
So, you know, here I am now, on the deck of Titan@@ ic, sitting in a submer@@ si@@ ble, and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this, where I knew that the band had play@@ ed.
And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corrid@@ or of the ship.
When I say, "I'm operating it@@ ," but my mind is in the vehic@@ le.
I felt like I was physically present inside the ship@@ wrec@@ k of Titan@@ ic.
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience I've ever had, because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it, because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie.
And the set was based as an exact re@@ plica on the blue@@ prints of the ship.
So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.
And it really made me realize that the tele@@ presence experience - that you actually can have these robotic avat@@ ars, then your consciousness is injec@@ ted into the vehic@@ le, into this other form of existence.
It was really, really quite prof@@ ound.
And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-@@ human fu@@ tures that I can imagine, as a science fiction f@@ an.
So, having done these expedi@@ tions, and really beginning to appreciate what was down there, such as at the deep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amazing, amazing animals - they're basically ali@@ ens right here on Earth.
They live in an environment of chem@@ os@@ yn@@ thes@@ is.
They don't survive on sun@@ light-@@ based system the way we do.
And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to a 5@@ 00-@@ degre@@ e-@@ C@@ enti@@ grade water plum@@ es.
You think they can't possibly exist.
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well - again, it's the science fiction influ@@ ence, as a kid.
And I wound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with NASA, sitting on the NASA advis@@ ory board, planning actual space mission@@ s, going to Russia, going through the pre-@@ cos@@ mon@@ a@@ ut bio@@ medical protocol@@ s, and all these sorts of things, to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems.
And this was fascinating.
But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep@@ .
And taking them down so that they had access - astr@@ obi@@ olog@@ ists, planetary scientists, people who were interested in these extreme environments - taking them down to the v@@ ents, and letting them see, and take samples and test instrument@@ s, and so on.
So, here we were making documentary film@@ s, but actually doing science, and actually doing space science.
I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction f@@ an, you know, as a kid, and doing this stuff for real.
And you know, along the way in this journey of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
Now you think director has got to be a leader, leader of, cap@@ tain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.
I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expedi@@ tions.
Because I had to, at a certain point, say, "What am I doing out here?
Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?"
We don't make money at these damn show@@ s.
We barely break ev@@ en. There is no f@@ ame in it.
People sort of think I went away between "@@ Titan@@ ic@@ " and "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar" and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ ails some@@ place, sitting at the be@@ ach.
M@@ ade all these film@@ s, made all these documentary films for a very limited audience.
No fam@@ e, no gl@@ or@@ y, no money. What are you doing?
You're doing it for the task itself, for the challenge - and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is - for the thr@@ ill of discovery, and for that strange bon@@ d that happens when a small group of people form a tightly kn@@ it team.
Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people, working for years at a time, sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.
And in that bon@@ d, you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else.
When you come back to the shore and you say, "We had to do this, and the fiber op@@ tic, and the at@@ tent@@ u@@ ation, and the this and the that, all the technology of it, and the difficul@@ ty, the human-@@ performance aspects of working at se@@ a," you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that maybe co@@ ps have, or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it.
Cre@@ ates a bon@@ d, creates a bon@@ d of respec@@ t.
So, when I came back to make my next movie, which was "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," I tried to apply that same principle of leadership, which is that you respect your team, and you earn their respect in return.
And it really changed the dynam@@ ic.
So, here I was again with a small team, in un@@ char@@ ted territor@@ y, doing "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," coming up with new technology that didn't exist before.
Tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously exciting.
Tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously challeng@@ ing.
And we became a family, over a four@@ -and-@@ half year period.
And it completely changed how I do movies.
So, people have comm@@ ented on how, "Well, you know, you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of P@@ and@@ or@@ a."
To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business, the process itself, that changed as a result of that.
So, what can we synthes@@ ize out of all this?
You know, what are the lessons lear@@ ne@@ d?
Well, I think number one is curios@@ ity.
It's the most powerful thing you own.
Imagin@@ ation is a force that can actually manif@@ est a reality.
And the respect of your team is more important than all the lau@@ rel@@ s in the world.
I have young film@@ makers come up to me and say, "G@@ ive me some advice for doing this."
And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself.
Other people will do that for you - don't do it to yourself, don't bet against yourself, and take ris@@ k@@ s."
NASA has this phrase that they like@@ : "F@@ ail@@ ure is not an op@@ tion."
But failure has to be an option in art and in explor@@ ation, because it's a leap of faith.
And no important endeav@@ or that required innovation was done without risk.
You have to be willing to take those ris@@ ks.
So, that's the thought I would leave you with, is that in whatever you're doing, failure is an op@@ tion, but fear is not. Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Gary F@@ lake demos Pi@@ vo@@ t, a new way to brow@@ se and arr@@ ange massive amounts of images and data online. Buil@@ t on breakthrough Se@@ adr@@ ag@@ on technology, it enables spectacular zo@@ om@@ s in and out of web databas@@ es, and the discovery of patterns and links invisible in standard web brow@@ s@@ ing.
Gary F@@ la@@ ke@@ : Is Pi@@ vo@@ t a turning point for web explor@@ ation?
If I can leave you with one big idea today, it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts, and instead of thinking about information over@@ lo@@ ad, what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible.
So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age.
This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment.
It's called Pi@@ vo@@ t, and with Pi@@ vo@@ t what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths - say, accid@@ ents.
And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerg@@ es.
This is because, in the mid-@@ area here, people are at their most active, and over here they're at their most fra@@ il.
We can step back out again and then re@@ organize the data by cause of death, seeing that circul@@ atory diseases and cancer are the usual suspec@@ ts, but not for everyone.
If we go ahead and we filter by age - say 40 years or less - we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about.
And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men.
So you get the idea that viewing information, viewing data in this way, is a lot like swimming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graph@@ ic.
And if we can do this for raw data, why not do it for content as well@@ ?
So what we have right here is the cover of every single S@@ port@@ s Il@@ l@@ ustr@@ ated ever produc@@ ed.
It's all her@@ e; it's all on the web.
You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk.
With Pi@@ vo@@ t, you can drill into a decade.
You can drill into a particular year.
You can jump right into a specific issue.
So I'm looking at this@@ ; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue, the sport@@ s.
I'm a L@@ ance Armstrong f@@ an, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that, which reve@@ als, for me, all the issues in which L@@ ance Arm@@ strong@@ 's been a part of.
Now, if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these, I might think, "Well, what about taking a look at all of cycl@@ ing?"
So I can step back, and expand on that.
And I see Greg Le@@ Mon@@ d now.
And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way - going narro@@ w@@ er, broad@@ er, bac@@ king in, bac@@ king out - you're not search@@ ing, you're not brow@@ s@@ ing.
You're doing something that's actually a little bit different.
It's in between, and we think it changes the way information can be used.
So I want to extrapol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit crazy.
What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summar@@ y.
So the summar@@ y consists of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ s@@ is and an icon to indicate the topic@@ al area that it comes from.
I'm only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here.
But even in this limited view, we can do a lot of things.
Right away, we get a sense of what are the topic@@ al doma@@ ins that are most popular on Wikipedia.
I'm going to go ahead and select government.
Now, having selected government, I can now see that the Wikipedia categor@@ ies that most frequently cor@@ respond to that are Time magazine People of the Y@@ ear.
So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.
It's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them.
Looking at one of these particular summar@@ ies, I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Per@@ son of the Y@@ ear, bringing up all of them.
So looking at these people, I can see that the majority come from government@@ ; some have come from natural sci@@ enc@@ es; some, fewer still, have come from business - there's my boss - and one has come from music.
And interest@@ ingly enough, Bon@@ o is also a TED Prize win@@ ner.
So we can go, jum@@ p, and take a look at all the TED Prize win@@ ners.
So you see, we're navig@@ ating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web, not from pag@@ e-@@ to-@@ page, but at a higher level of abstr@@ action.
And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise.
I'm just showing the New York Times website here.
So Pi@@ vo@@ t, this application - I don't want to call it a brow@@ ser@@ ; it's really not a brow@@ ser, but you can view web pages with it - and we bring that zo@@ o@@ ma@@ ble technology to every single web page like this.
So I can step back, pop right back into a specific sec@@ tion.
Now the reason why this is important is because, by virtu@@ e of just viewing web pages in this way, I can look at my entire brow@@ sing history in the exact same way.
So I can drill into what I've done over specific time fr@@ am@@ es.
Here, in fact, is the state of all the demo that I just gav@@ e.
And I can sort of re@@ play some stuff that I was looking at earlier today.
And, if I want to step back and look at everything, I can slice and dice my history, perhaps by my search history - here, I was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic search@@ ing, looking for B@@ ing, over here for L@@ ive Lab@@ s Pi@@ vo@@ t.
And from these, I can drill into the web page and just launch them again.
It's one metaphor re@@ pur@@ posed multiple times, and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data.
So right now, in this world, we think about data as being this cur@@ se.
We talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ lo@@ ad.
We talk about dro@@ wning in data.
What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down, so that instead of navig@@ ating from one thing to the next, we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things, and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hid@@ den@@ ?
If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data, we might actually extract information.
And, instead of dealing just with information, we can te@@ ase out knowledge.
And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found.
So with that, I thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Using examples from vac@@ ations to colon@@ os@@ copi@@ es, Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and founder of behavioral economics Daniel Kah@@ ne@@ man reveals how our "@@ experiencing selv@@ es" and our "@@ remembering selv@@ es" perceive happiness differently. This new insight has profound implications for economics, public policy - and our own self-@@ awar@@ eness.
Daniel Kah@@ n@@ em@@ an: The rid@@ dle of experience v@@ s. memory.
Everybody talks about happiness these days.
I had somebody count the number of books with "@@ happin@@ ess@@ " in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness, among research@@ ers.
There is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing.
Everybody would like to make people happi@@ er.
But in spite of all this f@@ lood of work, there are several cognitive trap@@ s that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness.
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive trap@@ s.
This applies to lay@@ people thinking about their own happiness, and it applies to schol@@ ars thinking about happiness, because it turns out we're just as mes@@ sed up as anybody else is.
The first of these trap@@ s is a re@@ luct@@ ance to admit complexity.
It turns out that the word "@@ happin@@ ess@@ " is just not a useful word anymore, because we apply it to too many different things.
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restric@@ t it, but by and large, this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is.
The second tra@@ p is a confus@@ ion between experience and memor@@ y; basically, it's between being happy in your life, and being happy about your life or happy with your life.
And those are two very different concept@@ s, and they're both lum@@ ped in the notion of happiness.
And the third is the focusing illus@@ ion, and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumst@@ ance that affects well-being without distor@@ ting its import@@ ance.
I mean, this is a real cognitive trap@@ .
There's just no way of getting it right.
Now, I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question@@ -and-@@ answer session after one of my lec@@ tures reported a story, and that was a story - He said he'd been listening to a sym@@ phon@@ y, and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding, there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching sound.
And then he ad@@ ded, really quite emotion@@ ally, it ru@@ ined the whole experience.
But it had@@ n't.
What it had ru@@ ined were the memories of the experience.
He had had the experience.
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music.
They counted for nothing because he was left with a memor@@ y; the memory was ru@@ in@@ ed, and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep@@ .
What this is telling us, really, is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves.
There is an experiencing self, who lives in the present and knows the present, is capable of re-@@ living the past, but basically it has only the present.
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches - you know, when the doctor as@@ ks, "@@ Does it hurt now when I touch you here?"
And then there is a remembering self, and the remembering self is the one that keeps sco@@ re, and maintain@@ s the story of our life, and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question, "How have you been feeling l@@ ate@@ ly@@ ?"
Or "How was your trip to Al@@ b@@ ani@@ a?" or something like that.
Those are two very different enti@@ ties, the experiencing self and the remembering self, and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness.
Now, the remembering self is a story@@ tel@@ ler.
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories - it starts immediately.
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.
Our memory tells us stories, that is, what we get to keep from our experiences is a story.
And let me begin with one example.
This is an old study.
Those are actual patients under@@ going a painful proced@@ ure.
I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days, but it was painful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s.
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.
Here are two patients, those are their recor@@ d@@ ings.
And you are asked, "Who of them suffered mor@@ e?"
And it's a very easy question.
Clear@@ ly, Pati@@ ent B suffered more - his colon@@ os@@ copy was longer, and every minute of pain that Pati@@ ent A had, Pati@@ ent B had, and more.
But now there is another question: "How much did these patients think they suffer@@ ed@@ ?"
And here is a surprise.
The surprise is that Pati@@ ent A had a much worse memory of the colon@@ os@@ copy than Pati@@ ent B.
The stories of the colon@@ os@@ copies were different, and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great - but one of them is this distinct ... but one of them is distinc@@ tly worse than the other.
And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end@@ ; it's a bad story.
How do we know that?
Because we asked these people after their colon@@ os@@ cop@@ y, and much later, too, "How bad was the whole thing, in total@@ ?"
And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.
Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self.
From the point of view of the experiencing self, clearly, B had a worse time.
Now, what you could do with Pati@@ ent A, and we actually ran clinical experiments, and it has been done, and it does work - you could actually extend the colon@@ os@@ copy of Pati@@ ent A by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ gling it too much.
That will cause the patient to suffer@@ , but just a little and much less than before.
And if you do that for a couple of minutes, you have made the experiencing self of Pati@@ ent A worse off, and you have the remembering self of Pati@@ ent A a lot better off, because now you have endo@@ wed Pati@@ ent A with a better story about his experience.
What defin@@ es a stor@@ y?
And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us, and it's also true of the stories that we make up.
What defin@@ es a story are changes, significant moments and end@@ ings.
En@@ dings are very, very important and, in this case, the ending domin@@ ated.
Now, the experiencing self lives its life continu@@ ously.
It has moments of experience, one after the other.
And you can ask@@ : What happens to these moment@@ s?
And the answer is really straight@@ forwar@@ d: They are lost forever.
I mean, most of the moments of our life - and I calcul@@ ated, you know, the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long@@ ; that means that, you know, in a life there are about 600 million of them@@ ; in a month, there are about 6@@ 00,000 - most of them don't leave a trac@@ e.
Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self.
And yet, somehow you get the sense that they should coun@@ t, that what happens during these moments of experience is our life.
It's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth.
And how to spend it would seem to be relevant@@ , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us.
So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self, and they're really quite distinc@@ t.
The biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time.
From the point of view of the experiencing self, if you have a vac@@ ation, and the second week is just as good as the first, then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week vac@@ ation.
That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.
For the remembering self, a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is barely better than the one-@@ week vac@@ ation because there are no new memories ad@@ ded.
You have not changed the story.
And in this way, time is actually the critical vari@@ able that distingu@@ ishes a remembering self from an experiencing self@@ ; time has very little impact on the story.
Now, the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories.
It is actually the one that makes decisions because, if you have a patient who has had, say, two colon@@ os@@ copies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choos@@ e, then the one that choos@@ es is the one that has the memory that is less bad, and that's the surgeon that will be chos@@ en.
The experiencing self has no voice in this choice.
We actually don't choose between experiences, we choose between memories of experiences.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally as experiences.
We think of our future as anticipa@@ ted memor@@ ies.
And basically you can look at this, you know, as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the remembering self, and you can think of the remembering self sort of drag@@ ging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need.
I have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequently the cas@@ e; that is, we go on vac@@ ations, to a very large ex@@ tent, in the service of our remembering self.
And this is a bit hard to justify I think.
I mean, how much do we consume our memori@@ es?
That is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remembering self.
And when I think about that, I think about a vac@@ ation we had in Antarctica a few years ago, which was clearly the best vac@@ ation I've ever had, and I think of it relatively often, relative to how much I think of other vac@@ ations.
And I probably have consumed my memories of that three-@@ week tri@@ p, I would say, for about 25 minutes in the last four years.
Now, if I had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it, I would have spent another hour.
Now, that is three weeks, and that is at most an hour and a half.
There seems to be a discre@@ p@@ ancy.
Now, I may be a bit extre@@ me, you know, in how little ap@@ peti@@ te I have for consuming memor@@ ies, but even if you do more of this, there is a genuine question: Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experienc@@ es?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment.
Imagine that for your next vac@@ ation, you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destroy@@ ed, and you'll get an am@@ nes@@ ic drug so that you won't remember anything.
Now, would you choose the same vac@@ ation? And if you would choose a different vac@@ ation, there is a conflict between your two selves, and you need to think about how to ad@@ jud@@ ic@@ ate that conflict, and it's actually not at all obvious, because if you think in terms of time, then you get one answer, and if you think in terms of memor@@ ies, you might get another answer.
Why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that confron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves.
Now, the two selves bring up two notions of happiness.
There are really two concepts of happiness that we can appl@@ y, one per self.
So you can ask@@ : How happy is the experiencing self@@ ?
And then you would ask@@ : How happy are the moments in the experiencing self@@ 's life?
And they're all - happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process.
What are the emotions that can be measure@@ d?
And, by the way, now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self, it's a completely different thing.
This is not about how happily a person lives.
It is about how satis@@ fied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life.
Very different no@@ tion.
Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness, and I belong to a crowd of students of well-@@ being, who've been mess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way.
The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years, and there are now efforts to measure the two separ@@ ately.
The Gal@@ lu@@ p Organization has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences, and there have been other efforts along those lines.
So in recent years, we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves.
And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different.
You can know how satis@@ fied somebody is with their life, and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life, and vice versa.
Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation, the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5.
What that means is if you met somebody, and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tal@@ l@@ ," how much would you know about his heigh@@ t?
Well, you would know something about his he@@ ight, but there's a lot of uncertain@@ ty.
You have that much uncertain@@ ty.
If I tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten, you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self.
So the cor@@ relation is low.
We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self.
We know that money is very important, goals are very important.
We know that happiness is mainly being satis@@ fied with people that we like, spending time with people that we like.
There are other pleas@@ ures, but this is domin@@ ant.
So if you want to maxim@@ ize the happiness of the two selves, you are going to end up doing very different things.
The bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitu@@ te for well-being.
It is a completely different no@@ tion.
Now, very quickly, another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not at@@ tend to the same things when we think about life, and we actually live.
So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California, you are not going to get to the correct answer.
When you ask that question, you think people must be happier in California if, say, you live in O@@ hi@@ o.
And what happens is when you think about living in California, you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places, and that contrast, say, is in climate.
Well, it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are.
But now, because the reflective self is in char@@ ge, you may end up - some people may end up moving to California.
And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happi@@ er.
Well, their experiencing self is not going to get happi@@ er.
We know that.
But one thing will happen@@ : They will think they are happi@@ er, because, when they think about it, they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in O@@ hi@@ o, and they will feel they made the right decision.
It is very difficult to think straight about well-@@ being, and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.
Thank you so much.
Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago, you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gal@@ lu@@ p surve@@ y.
Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now?
Daniel Kah@@ n@@ em@@ an: S@@ ure.
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gal@@ lu@@ p survey is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.
We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self.
When we looked at how feel@@ ings, vary with income.
And it turns out that, below an income of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans - and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 6@@ 00@@ ,000, so it's a large representative sample - below an income of 6@@ 00,000 dollars a year@@ ...
CA: 60@@ ,000.
D@@ K: 60@@ ,000.
60,000 dollars a year, people are un@@ happy, and they get progress@@ ively un@@ happier the poor@@ er they get.
A@@ bo@@ ve that, we get an absolutely flat line.
I mean I've rarely seen lines so fl@@ at.
Clear@@ ly, what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ ential happiness, but lack of money certainly bu@@ ys you miser@@ y, and we can measure that mis@@ ery very, very clear@@ ly.
In terms of the other self, the remembering self, you get a different story.
The more money you ear@@ n, the more satis@@ fied you are.
That does not hold for emotions.
CA: But D@@ ann@@ y, the whole American endeav@@ or is about life, liber@@ ty, the pursuit of happiness.
If people took seriously that fin@@ ding, I mean, it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about, like for example, tax@@ ation policy and so forth.
Is there any chance that politici@@ ans, that the country gener@@ ally, would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it?
D@@ K: You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy.
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States, no question about that, but in the U.K., it is happening, and in other countries it is happening.
People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy.
It's going to take a while, and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness, or whether they want to study life evalu@@ ation, so we need to have that debate fairly soon.
How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think, and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self.
This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.
In the United States, efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population.
This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two, part of national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will - or at least should be - the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years.
Thank you so much for invent@@ ing behavioral economics.
Thank you, Danny Kah@@ n@@ em@@ an.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: At TED@@ 2010, Bill Gates unve@@ ils his vision for the world's energy future, describing the need for "@@ mirac@@ les@@ " to avoid planetary catastr@@ op@@ he and explaining why he's bac@@ king a dramatically different type of nuclear reac@@ tor. The necessary go@@ al? Zero carbon emissions globally by 2050.
Bill Gates: Innov@@ ating to zer@@ o!
I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.
And that might seem a bit surprising because my full-time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and se@@ eds, about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives.
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people - in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.
The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow@@ : There will be too much rain, not enough rain, things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support.
And that leads to star@@ v@@ ation, it leads to uncertain@@ ty, it leads to un@@ rest@@ .
So, the climate changes will be terrible for them.
Also, the price of energy is very important to them.
In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of, to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy.
Now, the price of energy has come down over time.
Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.
The coal revolution fuel@@ ed the Industrial R@@ evolution, and, even in the 19@@ 00@@ s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity, and that's why we have refriger@@ ators, air@@ -@@ condition@@ ing, we can make modern materials and do so many things.
And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.
But, as we make it cheaper - and let's go for making it twice as cheap - we need to meet a new constrain@@ t, and that constrain@@ t has to do with CO2.
CO2 is warming the planet, and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straight@@ forward one.
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emit@@ ted, that leads to a temperature increas@@ e, and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effec@@ ts: the effects on the wea@@ ther@@ ; perhaps worse, the indirec@@ t effects, in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes, and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses.
Now, the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feed@@ backs are, there's some uncertainty there, but not very much.
And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be, but they will be extremely bad.
I asked the top scientists on this several times@@ : Do we really have to get down to near zer@@ o?
Can@@ 't we just cut it in half or a quar@@ ter?
And the answer is that until we get near to zero, the temperature will continue to ris@@ e.
And so that's a big challenge.
It's very different than saying "We're a tw@@ el@@ ve-@@ foot@@ -@@ high truck trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ foot bridge, and we can just sort of squee@@ ze under@@ ."
This is something that has to get to zero.
Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year, over 26 billion tons.
For each American, it's about 20 ton@@ s; for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.
It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.
And, somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero.
It's been constantly going up.
It's only various economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all, so we have to go from rapidly rising to fall@@ ing, and falling all the way to zero.
This equation has four factor@@ s, a little bit of multiplic@@ ation: So, you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero, and that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
So, let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
Prob@@ ably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
Now that's back from high school alge@@ br@@ a, but let's take a look.
First, we've got population.
The world today has 6.@@ 8 billion people.
That's headed up to about nine billion.
Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccin@@ es, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent, but there we see an increase of about 1.@@ 3.
The second factor is the services we use.
This en@@ comp@@ asses every@@ thing: the food we eat, clo@@ thing, TV, he@@ ating.
These are very good things: getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet.
And it's a great thing for this number to go up.
In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion, we probably could cut back and use less, but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up, and so, over all, that will more than double the services delivered per person.
Here we have a very basic serv@@ ice: Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your home@@ work?
And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out and reading their school work under the street l@@ amp@@ s.
Now, effici@@ ency, E, the energy for each service, here finally we have some good news.
We have something that's not going up.
Through various inven@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting, through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings - there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substanti@@ ally.
Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.
There are other services like how we make fertiliz@@ er, or how we do air transport@@ , where the rooms for improvement are far, far less.
And so, overall here, if we're optim@@ istic, we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of si@@ x.
But for these first three factors now, we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion ton@@ s, and that just won't cut it.
So let's look at this fourth factor - this is going to be a key one - and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.
And so the question is: Can you actually get that to zer@@ o?
If you burn coal, no.
If you burn natural gas, no.
Almost every way we make electricity today, except for the emerging renew@@ ables and nuclear, puts out CO2.
And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale, is create a new system.
And so, we need energy mirac@@ les.
Now, when I use the term "@@ mirac@@ le@@ ," I don't mean something that's impossible.
The micro@@ proc@@ essor is a mirac@@ le. The personal computer is a mirac@@ le.
The Internet and its services are a mirac@@ le.
So, the people here have participa@@ ted in the creation of many mirac@@ les.
Usu@@ ally, we don't have a dead@@ line, where you have to get the miracle by a certain date.
Usu@@ ally, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't.
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timel@@ ine.
Now, I thought, "How could I really capture this?
Is there some kind of natural illustr@@ ation, some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?"
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosqu@@ itos, and somehow people enjoyed that.
It really got them involved in the idea of, you know, there are people who live with mosquitos.
So, with energy, all I could come up with is this.
I decided that releasing firef@@ lies would be my contribution to the environment here this year.
So here we have some natural firef@@ lies.
I'm told they don't bi@@ te; in fact, they might not even leave that j@@ ar.
Now, there's all sorts of g@@ im@@ mic@@ ky solutions like that one, but they don't really add up to much.
We need solutions - either one or several - that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reli@@ ability, and, although there's many directions people are see@@ king, I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers.
I've left out ti@@ de, ge@@ other@@ mal, fus@@ ion, bio@@ fuels.
Those may make some contribu@@ tion, and if they can do better than I expec@@ t, so much the better, but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five, and we can't give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting, because they all have significant challenges.
Let's look first at the burning fossil fuel@@ s, either burning coal or burning natural gas.
What you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not, and that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flu@@ e, press@@ uri@@ ze it, create a liqu@@ id, put it somewhere, and hope it stays there.
Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level, but getting up to that full percent@@ age, that will be very trick@@ y, and agre@@ eing on where these CO2 quanti@@ ties should be put will be hard, but the tough@@ est one here is this long-term issue.
Who's going to be su@@ re@@ ?
Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things?
This is a lot of volume.
So that's a tough one.
Next would be nuclear.
It also has three big problem@@ s: Cos@@ t, particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries, is high@@ ; the issue of the saf@@ ety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong, that, even though you have these human oper@@ ators, that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.
And then what do you do with the was@@ te?
And, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that.
People need to feel good about it.
So three very tough problems that might be solv@@ able, and so, should be worked on.
The last three of the five, I've grou@@ ped together.
These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources.
And they actually - although it's great they don't require fuel - they have some dis@@ advant@@ ages.
One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant.
This is energy far@@ ming, so you're talking about many square miles, thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant.
Also, these are inter@@ mit@@ tent sources.
The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day, and, like@@ wise, the wind doesn't blow all the time.
And so, if you depend on these sourc@@ es, you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available.
So, we've got big cost challenges here, we have transmission challeng@@ es: for example, say this energy source is outside your countr@@ y; you not only need the technology, but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from else@@ where.
And, finally, this storage problem.
And, to dimension@@ alize this, I went through and looked at all the types of batteri@@ es that get made - for cars, for computers, for phones, for flash@@ lights, for everything - and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses, and what I found is that all the batteri@@ es we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy.
And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here, something that's going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now.
It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing.
Now, this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mit@@ tent source to be ab@@ ov@@ e, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're us@@ ing.
If you're counting on it for 100 percent, you need an incredible miracle batter@@ y.
Now, how we're going to go forward on this - what's the right approach@@ ?
Is it a Manhattan Projec@@ t? What's the thing that can get us there?
Well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundred@@ s.
In each of these five path@@ s, we need at least a hundred people.
And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, "@@ They're craz@@ y." That's good.
And, I think, here in the TED group, we have many people who are already pursuing this.
Bill G@@ ros@@ s has several companies, including one called e@@ Solar that has some great solar thermal technologies.
Vin@@ od K@@ hos@@ la@@ 's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibil@@ ities, and I'm trying to help back that.
Nathan My@@ hr@@ vol@@ d and I actually are bac@@ king a company that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach.
There are some innovations in nuclear@@ : modul@@ ar, liqu@@ id.
And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago, so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising.
The idea of Ter@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer is that, instead of burning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um - the one percent, which is the U@@ 2@@ 35 - we decided, "Let's burn the 99 percent, the U@@ 23@@ 8@@ ."
It is kind of a crazy idea.
In fact, people had talked about it for a long time, but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not, and so it's through the adv@@ ent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simulate and see that, yes, with the right material@@ 's approach, this looks like it would work.
And, because you're burning that 99 percent, you have great@@ ly improved cost profi@@ le.
You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel all the lef@@ to@@ ver waste from today's reac@@ tors.
So, instead of worrying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing.
It breath@@ es this ur@@ ani@@ um as it goes along, so it's kind of like a cand@@ le.
You can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reac@@ tor.
In terms of fuel, this really sol@@ ves the problem.
I've got a picture here of a place in Kent@@ uck@@ y.
This is the lef@@ to@@ ver, the 99 percent, where they've taken out the part they burn now, so it's called deple@@ ted ur@@ ani@@ um.
That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years.
And, simply by fil@@ tering sea@@ water in an in@@ expensive process, you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet.
So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead, but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward.
So let's think@@ : How should we measure ourselv@@ es?
What should our report card look like?
Well, let's go out to where we really need to get, and then look at the intermedi@@ ate.
For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduc@@ tion.
That really is very important, that we get there.
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries, still some agriculture, hopefully we will have clean@@ ed up for@@ estr@@ y, c@@ ement.
So, to get to that 80 percent, the developed countries, including countries like China, will have had to switch their electricity generation al@@ together.
So, the other grade is: Are we deplo@@ ying this zero-@@ emis@@ sion technology, have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it else@@ wher@@ e?
That's super important.
That's a key element of making that report card.
So, bac@@ king up from there, what should the 20@@ 20 report card look like?
Well, again, it should have the two elem@@ ents.
We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reduc@@ tion@@ s: The less we em@@ it, the less that sum will be of CO2, and, therefore, the less the temperature.
But in some ways, the grade we get there, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reduc@@ tions, is only equ@@ ally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other, which is the piece of innovation on these break@@ through@@ s.
These break@@ through@@ s, we need to move those at full speed, and we can measure that in terms of companies, pilot projects, regul@@ atory things that have been changed.
There's a lot of great books that have been written about this.
The Al Gore book, "@@ Our Cho@@ ic@@ e" and the David McK@@ ay book, "S@@ us@@ tain@@ able Energ@@ y Without the Ho@@ t Air@@ ."
They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discus@@ sed broad@@ ly, because we need broad bac@@ king for this.
There's a lot that has to come together.
So this is a wish.
It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.
If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years - I could pick who's presid@@ ent, I could pick a vaccin@@ e, which is something I love, or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented - this is the wish I would pic@@ k.
This is the one with the greatest impact.
If we don't get this wish, the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terri@@ ble, between the U.S. and China, between poor countries and rich, and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse.
So, what do we have to do?
What am I appe@@ aling to you to step forward and dri@@ ve?
We need to go for more research fund@@ ing.
When countries get together in places like Copenhag@@ en, they shouldn't just discuss the CO2.
They should discuss this innovation agend@@ a, and you'd be stun@@ ned at the ridicul@@ ously low levels of spending on these innovative approach@@ es.
We do need the market incentives - CO2 tax@@ , cap and trade - something that gets that price signal out there.
We need to get the message out.
We need to have this dialogue be a more ration@@ al, more understand@@ able dialo@@ gue, including the steps that the government tak@@ es.
This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achie@@ ve.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. So to understand more about Ter@@ ra@@ Po@@ w@@ er, right - I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is?
B@@ il Gates: To actually do the software, buy the super@@ computer, hire all the great scientists, which we've done, that's only tens of milli@@ ons, and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work proper@@ ly, then you'll only be up in the hundreds of milli@@ ons.
The tough thing is building the pilot reac@@ tor@@ ; finding the several billion, finding the regul@@ ator, the location that will actually build the first one of these.
Once you get the first one built, if it works as adverti@@ sed, then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy den@@ sit@@ y, are so different than nuclear as we know it.
CA: And so, to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel, of this sort of spent ur@@ ani@@ um, and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down@@ ?
BG: That's right. Today, you're always refu@@ eling the reac@@ tor, so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong@@ : that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out, that's not good.
So, if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in - just think of it as a log - put it down and not have those same complex@@ ities.
And it just sits there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years, and then it's done.
CA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste dispos@@ al solution.
BG: Yeah. Well, what happens with the waste, you can let it sit there - there's a lot less waste under this approach - then you can actually take that, and put it into another one and burn that.
And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today, that's sitting in these cooling po@@ ols or dry cas@@ king by reac@@ tors - that's our fuel to begin with.
So, the thing that's been a problem from those reac@@ tors is actually what gets fed into our@@ s, and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process.
CA: I mean, you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here.
Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this?
BG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place, and there's all these interesting dis@@ clos@@ ure rules about anything that's called "@@ nuclear@@ ," so we've got a lot of interest, that people from the company have been in Russia, India, China - I've been back seeing the secre@@ tary of energy here, talking about how this fits into the energy agenda.
So I'm optim@@ istic. You know, the French and Japanese have done some work.
This is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done.
It's an important adv@@ ance, but it's like a fast reac@@ tor, and a lot of countries have built them, so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built.
CA: So, in your mind, times@@ cal@@ e and likelihood of actually taking something like this li@@ ve?
BG: Well, we need - for one of these high-@@ scale, electr@@ o-@@ generation things that's very cheap, we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deplo@@ y.
That's sort of the dead@@ line that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet.
And, you know, Ter@@ ra@@ Po@@ w@@ er, if things go well - which is w@@ ishing for a lot - could easily meet that.
And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies - we need it to be hundreds - who, like@@ wise, if their science goes well, if the funding for their pilot plants goes well, that they can compete for this.
And it's best if multiple succe@@ ed, because then you could use a mix of these things.
We certainly need one to succe@@ ed.
CA: In terms of big@@ -@@ scale possible game changes, is this the biggest that you're aware of out there?
BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing.
It would have been, even without the environmental constrain@@ t, but the environmental constrain@@ t just makes it so much great@@ er.
In the nuclear space, there are other innov@@ ators.
You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one, but the mod@@ ular people, that's a different approach.
There's a liqu@@ id@@ -@@ type reac@@ tor, which seems a little hard, but maybe they say that about us.
And so, there are different ones, but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal, and so - if you can deal with the neg@@ atives, which are essentially the radiation - the footprint and cost, the potential, in terms of effect on land and various things, is almost in a class of its own.
CA: If this doesn't work, then what?
Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth st@@ able?
BG: If you get into that situation, it's like if you've been over-@@ e@@ ating, and you're about to have a heart attack@@ : Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something.
There is a line of research on what's called geo@@ engineering, which are various techniques that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together.
Now, that's just an insurance policy.
You hope you don't need to do that.
Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you laz@@ y, that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you.
I'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem, but there's now the geo@@ engineering discussion about - should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster, or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expec@@ t?
CA: Climate skep@@ tic@@ s: If you had a sentence or two to say to them, how might you persuade them that they're wrong?
BG: Well, unfortunately, the skep@@ tics come in different camp@@ s.
The ones who make scientific arguments are very fe@@ w.
Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that off@@ set things?
There are very, very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things.
The main problem we have here, it's kind of like AIDS.
You make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later.
And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems, the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later, and a somewhat un@@ certain pain thing - in fact, the IP@@ C@@ C report, that's not necessarily the worst case, and there are people in the rich world who look at IP@@ C@@ C and say, "OK, that isn't that big of a de@@ al."
The fact is it's that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this.
But my dream here is that, if you can make it econom@@ ic, and meet the CO2 constrain@@ ts, then the skep@@ tics say, "OK, I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2, I kind of wish it did put out CO2, but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come befor@@ e."
CA: And so, that would be your response to the B@@ jor@@ n L@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument@@ , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem, it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth, it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do.
BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&amp;@@ D piece - say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now - it's not that dramatic@@ .
It shouldn't take away from other things.
The thing you get into big money on, and this, reasonable people can disagre@@ e, is when you have something that's non-@@ economic and you're trying to fund that - that, to me, mostly is a waste.
Un@@ less you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap, I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive.
If the trade-@@ off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensi@@ ve@@ ," then the rich can afford that.
I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifesty@@ le.
The disaster is for that two billion.
And even L@@ om@@ bor@@ g has changed.
His sh@@ tic@@ k now is, "Why isn't the R&amp;@@ D getting more discus@@ se@@ d@@ ?"
He's still, because of his earlier stuff, still associated with the skep@@ tic cam@@ p, but he's realized that's a pretty lonely cam@@ p, and so, he's making the R&amp;@@ D point.
And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropri@@ ate.
The R&amp;@@ D piece, it's crazy how little it's fun@@ ded.
CA: Well B@@ ill, I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much.
BG: Thank you.

I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laugh@@ ing, it was so lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous, but I'd just gotten past "@@ man@@ g@@ led@@ ," and my voice bro@@ ke, and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assaul@@ t from these words un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed.
You know, of course, this is my r@@ ag@@ g@@ edy old thes@@ aur@@ us so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right?
But, in fact, the print date was the early 198@@ 0s, when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me.
And, need@@ less to say, thank God I wasn't using a thes@@ aur@@ us back then.
I mean, from this entr@@ y, it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatso@@ ever going for them, when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and advent@@ ures my life has proc@@ ure@@ d.
So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edi@@ tion, expecting to find a re@@ vision worth not@@ ing.
Here's the up@@ dated version of this entr@@ y.
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
I find the last two words under "@@ Ne@@ ar Anton@@ ym@@ s," particularly un@@ sett@@ l@@ ing: "@@ who@@ le@@ " and "@@ whol@@ es@@ ome@@ ."
So, it's not just about the words.
It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.
It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.
Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people.
In fact, many ancient societies, including the Gree@@ ks and the Roman@@ s, believed that to utter a cur@@ se verb@@ ally was so powerful, because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.
So, what reality do we want to call into exist@@ ence: a person who is limi@@ ted, or a person who's empower@@ ed?
By cas@@ ually doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person, a child, we might be putting lid@@ s and cas@@ ting shado@@ ws on their power.
Wouldn't we want to open doors for them inste@@ ad@@ ?
One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.@@ I. du@@ Pon@@ t Institute in Wil@@ ming@@ ton, Del@@ awar@@ e.
His name was Dr. P@@ iz@@ z@@ util@@ lo, an Italian American, whose name, appar@@ ently, was too difficult for most Americans to pron@@ oun@@ ce, so he went by Dr. P.
And Dr. P always wore really color@@ ful bow ties and had the very perfect dis@@ position to work with children.
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital, with the exception of my physical therapy sess@@ ions.
I had to do what seemed like in@@ numer@@ able repeti@@ tions of exercis@@ es with these th@@ ick, el@@ as@@ tic b@@ ands - different colors, you know - to help build up my leg mus@@ cles, and I hated these b@@ ands more than anything - I hated them, had names for them. I hated them.
And, you know, I was already bar@@ gain@@ ing, as a five year-old child, with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercis@@ es, un@@ success@@ fully, of course.
And, one day, he came in to my session - exhaus@@ tive and un@@ forgi@@ ving, these sess@@ ions - and he said to me, "Wo@@ w. Aime@@ e, you are such a strong and powerful little girl, I think you're going to break one of those band@@ s.
When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred buck@@ s."
Now, of course, this was a simple plo@@ y on Dr. P@@ 's part to get me to do the exercis@@ es I didn't want to do before the prospec@@ t of being the richest fi@@ ve@@ -year-old in the second floor ward, but what he effectively did for me was res@@ hap@@ e an awful daily occurr@@ ence into a new and promising experience for me.
And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong, powerful and athle@@ tic person well into the future.
This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ign@@ ite the power of a child.
But, in the previous inst@@ ances of those thes@@ aur@@ us entr@@ ies, our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want, the possibility of an individual to see themselves as cap@@ able.
Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society, many of which have been brought about by technology.
Cer@@ tain@@ ly, from a medical stand@@ point, my legs, laser surgery for vision im@@ pair@@ ment, tit@@ ani@@ um kne@@ es and hip replac@@ ements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abil@@ ities, and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them - not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self-@@ identi@@ f@@ y, to claim their own descrip@@ tions of themselves, so they can go al@@ ign with global groups of their own choos@@ ing.
So, perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth@@ : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society, and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asse@@ t.
The human ability to adap@@ t, it's an interesting thing, because people have continu@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming advers@@ ity, and I'm going to make an ad@@ mission@@ : This phrase never sat right with me, and I always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people's questions about it, and I think I'm starting to figure out why.
Im@@ plic@@ it in this phrase of "@@ over@@ coming advers@@ ity" is the idea that success, or happiness, is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience un@@ s@@ ca@@ th@@ ed or un@@ marked by the experience, as if my succ@@ esses in life have come about from an ability to sid@@ este@@ p or circum@@ navigate the presum@@ ed pit@@ falls of a life with pros@@ the@@ tics, or what other people perceive as my dis@@ ability.
But, in fact, we are changed. We are mark@@ ed, of course, by a challenge, whether physic@@ ally, emotionally or both.
And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.
Ad@@ vers@@ ity isn't an obstac@@ le that we need to get around in order to resume living our life.
It's part of our life.
And I tend to think of it like my shado@@ w.
Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little, but it's always with me.
And, certain@@ ly, I'm not trying to dimin@@ ish the impac@@ t, the weight, of a person's strugg@@ le.
There is advers@@ ity and challenge in life, and it's all very real and relative to every single person, but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet advers@@ ity, but how you're going to meet it.
So, our responsibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from advers@@ ity, but preparing them to meet it well.
And we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adap@@ t.
There's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ tee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disab@@ led.
And, truth@@ fully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those defini@@ tions.
In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical pro@@ g@@ nos@@ is, or, indeed, a pro@@ g@@ nos@@ is on the expected quality of their life, we have to make sure that we don't put the first br@@ ick in a wall that will actually dis@@ able some@@ one.
Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it, serves to be more disab@@ ling to the individual than the path@@ ology itself.
By not treating the whol@@ eness of a person, by not acknowled@@ ging their poten@@ c@@ y, we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.
We are effectively grad@@ ing someone's worth to our community.
So we need to see through the path@@ ology and into the range of human cap@@ ability.
And, most importantly, there's a partnership between those perceived defici@@ encies and our greatest creative ability.
So it's not about de@@ valu@@ ing, or neg@@ ating, these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep under the ru@@ g, but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the advers@@ ity.
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming advers@@ ity as it is opening ourselves up to it, embracing it, grap@@ pling with it, to use a wrest@@ ling term, maybe even dancing with it.
And, perhaps, if we see advers@@ ity as natural, consistent and use@@ ful, we're less bur@@ den@@ ed by the presence of it.
This year we celebrate the 200@@ th birthday of Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution, that Darwin illustr@@ ated, I think, a truth about the human character.
To par@@ aph@@ ras@@ e: It's not the strong@@ est of the species that surviv@@ es, nor is it the most intelligent that surviv@@ es; it is the one that is most adapt@@ able to change.
Con@@ flic@@ t is the gen@@ esis of cre@@ ation.
From Darwin@@ 's work, amongst others, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flour@@ ish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation.
So, again, transformation, adapt@@ ation, is our greatest human skill@@ .
And, perhaps, until we're teste@@ d, we don't know what we're made of.
Maybe that's what advers@@ ity gives us: a sense of self, a sense of our own power.
So, we can give ourselves a gif@@ t.
We can re-@@ imagine advers@@ ity as something more than just tough times.
Maybe we can see it as change.
Ad@@ vers@@ ity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.
I think the greatest advers@@ ity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normal@@ c@@ y.
Now, who's normal@@ ?
There's no normal.
There's common@@ , there's typic@@ al. There's no normal, and would you want to meet that poor, be@@ ig@@ e person if they exis@@ ted?
I don't think so.
If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normal@@ cy to one of possibility - or poten@@ c@@ y, to be even a little bit more dangerous - we can release the power of so many more children, and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community.
An@@ thro@@ p@@ ologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use, to be able to contribu@@ te.
There's evidence that Neanderth@@ als, 60,000 years ago, carried their elderly and those with serious physical injur@@ y, and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community.
They didn't view these people as broken and us@@ el@@ ess@@ ; they were seen as rare and valu@@ able.
A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ as@@ tern Pennsylv@@ ania, and I was standing over a bus@@ he@@ l of toma@@ to@@ es.
It was sum@@ mer@@ time@@ : I had shor@@ ts on.
I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aime@@ e Mul@@ l@@ ins@@ ."
And I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is.
And I said, "I'm sorry, s@@ ir, have we met@@ ? I don't remember meeting you."
He said, "Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me.
I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's w@@ om@@ b@@ ."
Oh, that guy.
And, but of course, actually, it did clic@@ k.
This man was Dr. Ke@@ an, a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day, because, of course, typical fash@@ ion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.
And so my mother's pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physician had gone on vac@@ ation, so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.
And, because I was born without the fi@@ bula bon@@ es, and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that, he had to be the bear@@ er - this stranger had to be the bear@@ er of bad news.
He said to me, "I had to give this pro@@ g@@ nos@@ is to your parents that you would never walk, and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independ@@ ence, and you've been making li@@ ar out of me ever sin@@ ce@@ ."
The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings throughout my whole childhood, whether winning a second grade sp@@ elling be@@ e, mar@@ ching with the Gir@@ l Sco@@ ut@@ s, you know, the Hal@@ lo@@ we@@ en par@@ ade, winning my college scholar@@ ship, or any of my sports vic@@ tor@@ ies, and he was using it, and integr@@ ating it into teaching resid@@ ent students.
M@@ ed students from H@@ ah@@ n@@ eman@@ n Medical School and Her@@ sh@@ ey Medical Scho@@ ol.
And he called this part of the course the X F@@ ac@@ tor, the potential of the human will.
No pro@@ g@@ nos@@ is can account for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the quality of someone's life.
And Dr. Ke@@ an went on to tell me, he said, "In my experience, unless repeate@@ dly told other@@ wise, and even if given a mod@@ ic@@ um of support, if left to their own devices, a child will achie@@ ve."
See, Dr. Ke@@ an made that shift in thinking.
He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it.
And there's been a shift in my thinking over time, in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old, if I would have trad@@ ed pros@@ the@@ tics for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -and-@@ bone legs, I wouldn't have hesit@@ ated for a second.
I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of normal@@ cy back then.
But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.
And it's because of the experiences I've had with them, not in spite of the experiences I've had with them.
And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lid@@ s and cast shado@@ ws on me.
See, all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power, and you're off.
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power - the human spirit is so recep@@ tive - if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment, you are educ@@ ating them in the best sense.
You're teaching them to open doors for themselves.
In fact, the exact meaning of the word "@@ educa@@ te" comes from the root word "@@ edu@@ ce@@ ."
It means "@@ to bring forth what is within@@ , to bring out potenti@@ al."
So again, which potential do we want to bring out?
There was a case study done in 196@@ 0s Britain, when they were moving from gram@@ mar schools to compreh@@ ensive schools.
It's called the stre@@ aming tri@@ als. We call it "@@ track@@ ing" here in the States.
It's separ@@ ating students from A, B, C, D and so on.
And the "A student@@ s" get the tough@@ er curricul@@ um, the best teachers, etc.
Well, they to@@ ok, over a three-@@ month period, D-@@ level students, gave them A@@ 's, told them they were "A@@ '@@ s," told them they were brigh@@ t, and at the end of this three-@@ month period, they were performing at A-@@ level.
And, of course, the heart@@ break@@ ing, flip side of this study, is that they took the "A student@@ s" and told them they were "D@@ '@@ s."
And that's what happened at the end of that three-@@ month period.
Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.
A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were du@@ ped too.
The teachers didn't know a switch had been made.
They were simply told, "@@ These are the '@@ A-@@ student@@ s@@ ,' these are the '@@ D-@@ student@@ s@@ .'" And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them.
So, I think that the only true disability is a crus@@ hed spir@@ it, a spirit that's been crus@@ hed doesn't have hope, it doesn't see beauty, it no longer has our natural, child@@ like curiosity and our inn@@ ate ability to imagine.
If instead, we can bol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope, to see beauty in themselves and others, to be curious and imagin@@ ative, then we are truly using our power well.
When a spirit has those qual@@ ities, we are able to create new real@@ ities and new ways of being.
I'd like to leave you with a poem by a four@@ teen@@ th-century Per@@ sian poet named Ha@@ fiz that my friend, Jac@@ ques Dem@@ bo@@ is told me about, and the poem is called "The God Who Only K@@ no@@ ws Four W@@ ord@@ s@@ ": "@@ Every child has known God, not the God of names, not the God of don@@ '@@ ts, but the God who only knows four words and keeps repe@@ ating them, saying, '@@ Come dance with me.
Co@@ me, dance with me. Co@@ me, dance with me@@ .'" Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Did you ever have a teacher who cared for you when no one else did@@ ? J@@ ok Church tells a short, moving story of the teacher who shel@@ tered him as a young gay teen and helped him grow - and how, many years later, he and his partner had the privilege of returning the favor.
J@@ ok Chur@@ ch@@ : A circle of car@@ ing.
You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's auth@@ or, in fact.
And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a far@@ mer, or in lea@@ ther@@ s, and no one has ever chose far@@ mer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epi@@ ph@@ ani@@ es.
And you know, an epi@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find that you dropped some@@ place.
You've just got to go around the block to see it as an epi@@ phan@@ y.
That's a painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that - Richard Bol@@ ling@@ bro@@ ke.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to tell you about.
My circle began back in the '60s in high school in S@@ to@@ w, Oh@@ io where I was the class que@@ er.
I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the bo@@ ys@@ ' room, until one teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go to the bath@@ room in the teacher@@ s' l@@ oun@@ ge.
She did it in secret.
She did it for three years.
And I had to get out of town.
I had a thumb@@ , I had 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California - met a lo@@ ver - and back in the '80s, found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, M@@ r@@ s. Pos@@ ten, who said, "I need to see you.
I'm disap@@ pointed that we never got to know each other as adults.
Could you please come to O@@ hi@@ o, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now.
And I should mention that I have pancre@@ atic cancer, and I'd like you to please be quick about this."
Well, the next day we were in Clevel@@ and.
We took a look at her, we laugh@@ ed, we cri@@ ed, and we knew that she needed to be in a hos@@ pic@@ e.
We found her one, we got her there, and we took care of her and watched over her family, because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ash@@ es and was placed in my hands.
And what had happened was the circle had clos@@ ed, it had become a circle - and that epi@@ ph@@ any I talked about presented itself.
The epi@@ ph@@ any is that death is a part of life.
She saved my life@@ ; I and my partner saved her@@ s.
And you know, that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
It also needs - it needs dign@@ ity, love and pleas@@ ure, and it's our job to hand those things out.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Pho@@ to@@ grapher Cam@@ il@@ le Se@@ am@@ an sho@@ ots ice@@ ber@@ gs, showing the world the complex beauty of these massi@@ ve, ancient chun@@ ks of ice. D@@ ive in to her photo slid@@ es@@ how, "The Last I@@ ce@@ ber@@ g@@ ."
Cam@@ il@@ le Se@@ am@@ an: Ha@@ un@@ ting photos of polar ice.
As an artist, connection is very important to me.
Through my work I'm trying to articul@@ ate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is inter@@ connected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first ice@@ ber@@ gs.
I was in aw@@ e.
My heart beat fast, my head was diz@@ z@@ y, trying to compreh@@ end what it was that stood in front of me.
The ice@@ ber@@ gs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snow@@ fl@@ ake on top of another snow@@ fl@@ ake, year after year.
I@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs are born when they cal@@ ve off of glaci@@ ers or break off of ice shel@@ ves.
Each ice@@ berg has its own individual personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bit@@ ter end, while others can't take it anymore and crum@@ ble in a fit of dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you look at an ice@@ berg, that they're isol@@ ated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.
But the reality is far from it.
As an ice@@ berg mel@@ ts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.
As the ice@@ berg mel@@ ts, it is releasing miner@@ al-@@ rich fresh water that n@@ our@@ ishes many forms of life.
I approach photograph@@ ing these ice@@ ber@@ gs as if I'm making portra@@ its of my ancest@@ ors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.
It is not a death when they mel@@ t; it is not an end, but a continu@@ ation of their path through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the ice@@ ber@@ gs that I photograph is very young - a couple thousand years old.
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an ice@@ berg that I photographed in Q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q@@ , Green@@ land.
It's a very rare occas@@ ion that you get to actually witness an ice@@ berg rol@@ ling.
So here it is.
You can see on the left side a small boat.
That's about a 15@@ -@@ foot boat.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the ice@@ berg and where it is at the water@@ line.
You can see here, it begins to rol@@ l, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an aver@@ age-@@ size Green@@ lan@@ dic ice@@ berg.
It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.
And this video is real time.
And just like that, the ice@@ berg shows you a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Alice D@@ reg@@ er works with people at the edge of anatom@@ y, such as con@@ joined tw@@ ins and inter@@ sex@@ ed people. In her observ@@ ation, it's often a fuzz@@ y line between male and femal@@ e, among other anatom@@ ical distinc@@ tions. Which brings up a huge question: Why do we let our an@@ at@@ omy determine our fa@@ te?
Alice Dre@@ ger@@ : Is an@@ at@@ omy destin@@ y?
I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the exact same day, at the exact same moment, each conce@@ iving a baby - okay?
So two couples each conce@@ iving one baby.
Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the concep@@ tion, because if you spend all that time imagining that concep@@ tion, you're not going to listen to me.
So just imagine that for a moment.
And in this scenari@@ o, I want to imagine that, in one case, the sperm is carrying a Y chromos@@ o@@ me, meeting that X chromos@@ ome of the eg@@ g.
And in the other case, the sperm is carrying an X chromos@@ o@@ me, meeting the X chromos@@ ome of the eg@@ g.
Both are vi@@ able@@ ; both take off.
We'll come back to these people later.
So I wear two h@@ ats in most of what I do.
As the one h@@ at, I do history of anatom@@ y.
I'm a histori@@ an by training, and what I study in that case is the way that people have deal@@ t with an@@ at@@ omy - meaning human bodies, animal bodies - how they deal@@ t with bodi@@ ly flu@@ ids, concepts of bodi@@ es; how have they thought about bodies.
The other h@@ at that I've wor@@ n in my work is as an activ@@ ist, as a patient advocate - or, as I sometimes say, as an im@@ patient advocate - for people who are patients of doctor@@ s.
In that case, what I've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norm@@ s.
So some of what I've worked on, for example, is people who are con@@ joined tw@@ ins - two people within one body.
Some of what I've worked on is people who have d@@ war@@ fis@@ m - so people who are much shorter than typic@@ al.
And a lot of what I've worked on is people who have at@@ y@@ pic@@ al sex - so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types.
And as a general term, we can use the term inter@@ sex for this.
Inter@@ sex comes in a lot of different forms.
I'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn't standard for male or femal@@ e.
So in one instance, you can have somebody who has an X@@ Y chromos@@ o@@ mal basis, and that S@@ R@@ Y gene on the Y chromos@@ ome tells the pro@@ to-@@ gon@@ ads, which we all have in the fet@@ al life, to become testes.
And so in the fet@@ al life the testes are pum@@ ping out testoster@@ one.
But because this individual lac@@ ks recep@@ tors to hear that testoster@@ one, the body doesn't react to the testoster@@ one.
And this is a syn@@ drome called and@@ rog@@ en in@@ sensitivity syndro@@ me.
So lots of levels of testoster@@ one, but no reaction to it.
As a consequ@@ ence, the body develop@@ s more along the female typical path.
When the child is born, she looks like a girl.
She is a girl. She is raised as a girl.
And it's often not until she hits puber@@ ty and she's growing and developing bre@@ as@@ ts, but she's not getting her period, that somebody figures out some@@ thing's up here.
And they do some tests and figure out that, instead of having ov@@ aries inside and a u@@ ter@@ us, she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromos@@ o@@ me.
Now what's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being mal@@ e, but they're really not.
F@@ em@@ al@@ es, like mal@@ es, have in our bodies something called the adr@@ en@@ al gl@@ and@@ s.
They're in the back of our body.
And the adr@@ en@@ al gl@@ ands make and@@ ro@@ gen@@ s, which are a mascul@@ in@@ izing hormon@@ e.
Most females like me - I believe myself to be a typical female - I don't actually know my chromos@@ o@@ mal make@@ -up but I think I'm probably typical - most females like me are actually and@@ ro@@ gen@@ -@@ sensi@@ tive.
We're making and@@ ro@@ gen@@ , and we're responding to and@@ ro@@ gen@@ s.
The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more and@@ ro@@ gens than the woman born with testes who has and@@ rog@@ en in@@ sensitivity syndro@@ me.
So sex is really complic@@ ate@@ d; it's not just that inter@@ sex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum - in some ways, they can be all over the place.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girl@@ friend, had sex with his girl@@ friend, had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ov@@ aries and a u@@ ter@@ us inside.
What he had was an extreme form of a condition called con@@ gen@@ ital adr@@ en@@ al hyper@@ plas@@ ia.
He had X@@ X chromosom@@ es, and in the w@@ om@@ b, his adr@@ en@@ al gl@@ ands were in such high gear that it created, essentially, a mascul@@ ine hormon@@ al environment.
And as a consequ@@ ence, his genit@@ als were mascul@@ in@@ z@@ ed, his brain was subject to the more typical mascul@@ ine component of hormon@@ es.
And he was born looking like a boy - nobody suspec@@ ted anything.
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstru@@ ating intern@@ ally, that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female intern@@ ally.
Okay, so just one more quick example of a way you can have inter@@ sex.
Some people who have X@@ X chromosom@@ es develop what are called o@@ vot@@ esti@@ s, which is when you have ov@@ arian tissue with tes@@ tic@@ ular tissue wrapped around it.
And we're not exactly sure why that happens.
So sex can come in lots of different vari@@ e@@ ties.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies - whether it's d@@ war@@ fis@@ m, or it's con@@ joined tw@@ in@@ ning, or it's an inter@@ sex type - are often norm@@ alized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health.
In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.
The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they thre@@ aten our social categori@@ es.
Or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of an@@ at@@ omy comes with a particular identity.
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identi@@ ty@@ ; what it means to be a black person is, al@@ leg@@ ed@@ ly, is to have an African an@@ at@@ omy in terms of your history.
And so we have this terribly simpl@@ istic idea.
And when we're faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different, it start@@ les us in terms of those categoriz@@ ations.
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individu@@ alism.
And our nation@@ 's really founded on a very romantic concept of individu@@ alism.
Well you can imagine how start@@ ling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body.
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African run@@ ner, Cas@@ ter Sem@@ en@@ y@@ a, had her sex called into question at the International G@@ ames in Ber@@ lin@@ .
I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me, "@@ Which is the test they're going to run that will tell us whether or not Cas@@ ter Sem@@ en@@ ya is male or fem@@ ale@@ ?"
And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and femal@@ e, or between male and inter@@ sex and female and inter@@ sex@@ ; we actually draw that line on nature.
So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes, the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categor@@ ies that we thought of as stable anatom@@ ical categor@@ ies that mapped very simply to stable identity categor@@ ies are a lot more fuzz@@ y than we thought.
And it's not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our termin@@ ology has allow@@ ed.
As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.
We look, for example, about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanze@@ es.
What are we to make of the fact that we dif@@ fer from them only really by a few nucle@@ o@@ ti@@ des@@ ?
And as we get farther and farther with our science, we get more and more into a dis@@ comfor@@ ted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simpl@@ istic categor@@ ies we've had are probably over@@ ly simpl@@ istic.
So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life.
One of the places we're seeing it, for example, in our culture today, in the United States today, is batt@@ les over the beginning of life and the end of life.
We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human, such that it has a different right than a fet@@ al life.
We have very difficult conversations nowad@@ ays - probably not out in the open as much as within medicine - about the question of when somebody's dead.
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead.
At most, they'd stick a fe@@ ather on somebody's nose, and if it twit@@ ch@@ ed, they didn't bury them yet.
If it stopped twit@@ ch@@ ing, you bury them.
But today, we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings.
And as a consequ@@ ence, we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who's dead, and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don't have such simple categor@@ ies as we've had before.
Now you might think that all this break@@ ing-@@ down of categor@@ ies would make somebody like me really happy.
I'm a political progress@@ ive, I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to you that it makes me nerv@@ ous.
Under@@ standing that these categor@@ ies are really much more unst@@ able than we thought makes me ten@@ se.
And it makes me ten@@ se from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
So in order to tell you about that ten@@ sion, I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the F@@ ounding Fa@@ ther@@ s.
I know they were rac@@ ists, I know they were sex@@ ist, but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that che@@ es@@ y musical "@@ 17@@ 7@@ 6@@ " every few years, and it's not because of the music, which is totally for@@ get@@ table.
It's because of what happened in 17@@ 76 with the F@@ ounding Fa@@ ther@@ s.
The F@@ ounding Fa@@ thers were, for my point of view, the original anatom@@ ical activ@@ ists, and this is why.
What they rejected was an anatom@@ ical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.
So as you all rec@@ all, what our F@@ ounding Fa@@ thers were rejec@@ ting was a concept of mon@@ arch@@ y, and the mon@@ arch@@ y was basically based on a very simpl@@ istic concept of anatom@@ y.
The mon@@ arch@@ s of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA, but they did have a concept of birth@@ right.
They had a concept of blue blood.
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth.
The F@@ ounding Fa@@ thers rejected that idea, and they replaced it with a new anatom@@ ical concept, and that concept was all men are created equ@@ al.
They level@@ ed that playing field and decided the an@@ at@@ omy that mat@@ tered was the common@@ ality of anatom@@ y, not the difference in anatom@@ y, and that was a really radical thing to do.
Now they were doing it in part because they were part of an En@@ lighten@@ ment system where two things were growing up together.
And that was democracy growing up, but it was also science growing up at the same time.
And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the F@@ ounding Fa@@ ther@@ s, a lot of them were very interested in science, and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ alistic world.
They were moving away from super@@ natural explan@@ ations, and they were rejec@@ ting things like a super@@ natural concept of power, where it transmitted because of a very v@@ ague concept of birth@@ right.
They were moving towards a natur@@ alistic concept.
And if you look, for example, in the Dec@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ depend@@ ence, they talk about nature and nature's God.
They don't talk about God and God's nature.
They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
So as part of that, they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatom@@ ical common@@ ality.
And in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights movement of the future.
They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
So what happened years after@@ war@@ d?
What happened was women, for example, who wanted the right to vo@@ te, took the F@@ ounding Fa@@ ther@@ s' concept of anatom@@ ical common@@ ality being more important than anatom@@ ical difference and said, "The fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and ov@@ aries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vo@@ te, the right to full citizen@@ ship, the right to own property, etc., etc@@ ."
And women successfully argued that.
Next came the successful Civil Rights movement, where we found people like So@@ jour@@ ner Tr@@ uth talking about, "A@@ in@@ 't I a wo@@ man@@ ?"
We find men on the mar@@ ching lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I am a man."
Again, people of color appe@@ aling to a common@@ ality of an@@ at@@ omy over a difference of anatom@@ y, again, success@@ fully.
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement.
The problem is, of course, that, as we begin to look at all that common@@ ality, we have to begin to question why we maintain certain di@@ vision@@ s.
Now mind you, I want to maintain some di@@ vision@@ s, anatom@@ ically, in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatom@@ y.
I don't want to say five-@@ year-olds should be allowed to cons@@ ent to sex or cons@@ ent to mar@@ ry.
So there are some anatom@@ ical divis@@ ions that make sense to me and that I think we should re@@ tain@@ .
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we re@@ tain them and do they have meaning.
So let's go back to those two beings conce@@ ived at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both conce@@ ived in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the exact same day.
Let's imagine one of them, Mar@@ y, is born three months prema@@ tu@@ rely, so she's born on June 1, 198@@ 0.
Hen@@ ry, by contrast, is born at term, so he's born on March 1, 198@@ 0.
Sim@@ ply by virtu@@ e of the fact that Mary was born prema@@ ture@@ ly three months, she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does - the right to cons@@ ent to sex, the right to vo@@ te, the right to drin@@ k.
Henry has to wait for all of that, not because he's actually any different in age, biolog@@ ically, except in terms of when he was born.
We find other kinds of weir@@ d@@ ness in terms of what their rights are.
Hen@@ ry, by virtu@@ e of being assumed to be male - although I haven't told you that he's the X@@ Y one - by virtu@@ e of being assumed to be male is now li@@ able to be dr@@ af@@ ted, which Mary does not need to worry about.
Mar@@ y, mean@@ while, cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states, namely, the right to mar@@ ry.
Henry can marry in every state a woman, but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman.
So we have these anatom@@ ical categor@@ ies that persis@@ t that are in many ways proble@@ matic and question@@ able.
And the question to me be@@ com@@ es: What do we do, as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatom@@ y, that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that's been based on an@@ at@@ omy might start falling apar@@ t?
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us.
So where do we go?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of prag@@ matic attitu@@ de: "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we will draw the line some@@ wher@@ e."
But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.
So for example, Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don't have a Y chromos@@ o@@ me, and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromos@@ o@@ me.
Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosom@@ es.
But this is also very bizar@@ re, because of the story I told you at the beginning about and@@ rog@@ en in@@ sensitivity syndro@@ me.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, he offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream@@ " speech.
He says we should judge people "@@ based not on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character@@ ," moving beyond anatom@@ y.
And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good ide@@ a."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of character@@ ?
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans, because, I have to adm@@ it, that there are some golden re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s I know that are probably more deser@@ ving of social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say there are probably also some yellow L@@ abr@@ ador@@ s that I know that are more capable of in@@ forme@@ d, intellig@@ ent, mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40@@ -@@ year-olds that I know.
So how do we oper@@ ation@@ alize the question of content of character@@ ?
It turns out to be really difficult.
And part of me also wonder@@ s, what if content of character turns out to be something that's scan@@ n@@ able in the future - able to be seen with an f@@ MR@@ I?
Do we really want to go there?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy.
We've done a really good job struggling with democracy, and I think we would do a good job in the future.
We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example, where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is li@@ able to be murder@@ ed, unless he's willing to submit to a sex change, in which case he's allowed to live.
We don't have that kind of situation.
I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with - a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of con@@ joined tw@@ ins in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.
But when I was on the phone with him, asking why he was going to do this surgery - this was a very high-@@ risk surgery - his answer was that, in this other nation, these children were going to be treated very bad@@ ly, and so he had to do this.
My response to him was, "Well, have you considered political as@@ yl@@ um instead of a separation surger@@ y?"
The United States has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are, without having them have to be changed for the sa@@ ke of the state.
So I think we have to be in the lead@@ .
Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you that I've been talking a lot about the father@@ s.
And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like, if we had more involved the mother@@ s.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a femin@@ ist, and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatom@@ ies, particularly when we have people thinking in groups.
Now for years, because I've been interested in inter@@ sex, I've also been interested in sex difference research.
And one of the things that I've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world.
And what we know from cross-@@ cultural studies is that femal@@ es, on average - not everyone, but on average - are more inclin@@ ed to be very att@@ enti@@ ve to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group.
And so if we think about that, we have an interesting situation on our hands.
Y@@ ears ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my graduate advis@@ ers who knew I was interested in femin@@ ism - I considered myself a femin@@ ist, as I still do - asked a really strange question.
He said, "T@@ ell me what's femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism@@ ."
And I thought, "Well that's the dum@@ best question I've ever heard.
Femin@@ ism is all about un@@ doing stereo@@ types about gend@@ er, so there's nothing femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism@@ ."
But the more I thought about his question, the more I thought there might be something femin@@ ine about femin@@ ism.
That is to say, there might be something, on average, different about female brains from male brains that makes us more att@@ enti@@ ve to deeply complex social relationships and more att@@ enti@@ ve to taking care of the vulner@@ able.
So whereas the fathers were extremely att@@ enti@@ ve to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state, it's possible that if we injec@@ ted more mothers into this concept, what we would have is more of a concept of, not just how to protec@@ t, but how to care for each other.
And maybe that's where we need to go in the future, when we take democracy beyond anatom@@ y, is to think less about the individual body, in terms of the identity, and think more about those relationships.
So that as we the people try to create a more perfect un@@ ion, we're thinking about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Back in 2009, Paul Rom@@ er unve@@ iled the idea for a "@@ char@@ ter cit@@ y" - a new kind of city with rules that favor democracy and trade. This year, at TED@@ 2011, he tells the story of how such a city might just happen in Hon@@ dur@@ as ... with a little help from his TEDTal@@ k.
Paul Rom@@ er: The world's first char@@ ter cit@@ y?
In 2007, I decided that we needed to re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we thought about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work, they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new resid@@ ents.
Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.
But the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it costs to build them.
So we could easily supply the world with doz@@ ens, maybe hundred@@ s, of new cities.
Now this might sound pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous to you if you've never thought about new cities.
But just substitu@@ te apartment building for cities.
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apart@@ ments already had them@@ ; the other half aren't there yet.
You could try and expand the capacity by doing addi@@ tions on all the existing apart@@ ments.
But you know what you'd run into is those apart@@ ments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid dis@@ comfort and the distrac@@ tions of construc@@ tion.
So it's extremely hard to do all of those addi@@ tions.
But you could go out some@@ place brand new, build a brand new apartment building, as long as the rules there were ones that facilit@@ ated construction rather than getting in the way.
So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a nam@@ e: char@@ ter cities.
L@@ ater I learned that at about this same time, J@@ avi@@ er and Oc@@ t@@ av@@ io were thinking about the challenge of reform in Hon@@ dur@@ as.
They knew that about 7@@ 5,000 Hon@@ dur@@ ans every year would leave to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in Hon@@ dur@@ as.
At one point, J@@ avi@@ er said to Oc@@ t@@ avi@@ o, "What if we took some of our empty land - what if we just gave it to an emb@@ ass@@ y - give some to the U.S. emb@@ ass@@ y; give some to the Canadian emb@@ ass@@ y - and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States, they can go get jobs, do everything they do on those emb@@ ass@@ y gr@@ ounds.
That they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?"
In the summer of 2009, Hon@@ dur@@ as went through a wr@@ en@@ ching constitu@@ tional crisis.
At the next regular@@ ly schedu@@ led election, Pep@@ e L@@ ob@@ o won in a land@@ slide on a platform that promised re@@ form, but reconcili@@ ation as well.
He asked Oc@@ t@@ av@@ io to be his chief of staf@@ f.
Meanwhile, I was getting ready to give a talk at TED@@ Glob@@ al.
Through a process of refin@@ ement, trial and err@@ or, a lot of user testing, I tried to bo@@ il this complicated concept of char@@ ter city down to the bare essenti@@ als.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say you can't come in and dist@@ ur@@ b all the existing apartment hol@@ der@@ s.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes technologies and rules to get progress, and it's usually the rules that hold us back.
In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatem@@ ala sent Oc@@ t@@ av@@ io a link to the TEDTal@@ k.
He showed it to J@@ avi@@ er.
They called me.
They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our countr@@ y."
So in December we met in Mi@@ ami, in a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, how much more valuable they are than they cost.
And I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York C@@ ity: notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases, per square meter.
But it was a fairly abstract discus@@ sion, and at some point when there was a pa@@ use, Oc@@ t@@ av@@ io said, "P@@ aul@@ , maybe we could watch the TEDTal@@ k."
So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms, a char@@ ter city is a place where you start with un@@ inhab@@ ited land, a char@@ ter that speci@@ fies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to op@@ t in, to go live under those rules or not.
So I was asked by the president of Hon@@ dur@@ as who said that we need to do this project, this is important, this could be the way forward for our country.
I was asked to come to Te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa and talk again on January fourth and fif@@ th.
So I presented another fac@@ t-@@ filled lecture that included a slide like this, which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city, it has to be very big.
This is a picture of Den@@ ver, and the out@@ line is the new air@@ port that was built in Den@@ ver.
This air@@ port alone covers more than 100 square kilome@@ ters.
So I was trying to persuade the Hon@@ dur@@ ans, if you build a new city, you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilome@@ ters.
That's more than 250 hundred@@ -@@ thousand acr@@ es.
Everybody applau@@ ded poli@@ tely.
The faces in the audience were very serious and att@@ enti@@ ve.
The leader of the congr@@ ess came up on stage and said, "@@ Professor Rom@@ er, thank you very much for your lec@@ ture, but maybe we could watch the TEDTal@@ k.
I've got it here on my laptop@@ ."
So I sat down, and they played the TEDTal@@ k.
And it got to the ess@@ ence, which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in Hon@@ dur@@ as, instead of hundreds of miles away in the Nor@@ th.
And it also involved new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders in the government there in Hon@@ dur@@ as would need help from partner countries, who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this char@@ ter and the enforc@@ ement, so everybody can trust that the char@@ ter really will be enforc@@ ed.
And the insight of President L@@ ob@@ o was that that assur@@ ance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Hon@@ dur@@ as who had suffered for so many years from fear and distr@@ us@@ t.
We went and looked at a site.
This pic@@ ture@@ 's from there.
It easily could hold a thousand square kilome@@ ters.
And shor@@ tly there@@ after, on January 19@@ th, they voted in the congr@@ ess to am@@ end their constitu@@ tion to have a constitu@@ tional pro@@ vision that allows for special development regi@@ ons.
In a country which had just gone through this wr@@ en@@ ching crisis, the vote in the congr@@ ess in favor of this constitu@@ tional am@@ end@@ ment was 1@@ 24 to one.
All parti@@ es, all fac@@ tions in society, backed this.
To be part of the constitu@@ tion, you actually have to pass it twice in the congr@@ ess.
On February 17th they passed it again with another vote of 1@@ 14 to one.
Im@@ medi@@ ately after that vo@@ te, on February 21st to the 24@@ th, a deleg@@ ation of about 30 Hon@@ dur@@ ans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business.
One is South Kore@@ a.
This is a picture of a big, new city center that's being built in South Korea - bigger than downtown Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the permit@@ s.
The other place that's very interested in city building is Sing@@ apor@@ e.
They've actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the thir@@ d.
So if you think about this practic@@ ally, here's where we are.
They've got a si@@ te; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.
They're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in, and also an external legal system.
One country has already volunte@@ ered to let its supre@@ me court be the court of final appeal for the new judici@@ al system there.
There's designers and build@@ ers of cities who are very intereste@@ d.
They even can bring with them some fin@@ anc@@ ing.
But the one thing you know they've already solved is that there's lots of ten@@ ants.
There's lots of businesses that would like to loc@@ ate in the Americ@@ as, especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there's lots of people who'd like to go there.
Around the world, there's 700 million people who say they'd like to move perman@@ ently some@@ place else right now.
There's a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job - sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clo@@ thing.
Sad@@ ly, sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reuni@@ ted with their parents that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.
So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in Hon@@ dur@@ as?
Or to build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these, around the world?
What kind of an idea is it to think about insist@@ ing that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new resid@@ ent@@ s?
This is an idea worth spread@@ ing.
And my friends from Hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say thank you, TED.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Desig@@ ner J@@ ess@@ i Ar@@ ring@@ ton packed nothing for TED@@ Ac@@ tive but 7 pairs of un@@ di@@ es, buying the rest of her clothes in thri@@ ft stores around L@@ A. It's a medit@@ ation on conscious consumption - wrapped in a rain@@ bow of color and creativity.
J@@ ess@@ i Ar@@ ring@@ ton: W@@ ear@@ ing nothing new.
I'm J@@ ess@@ i, and this is my suit@@ case.
But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confess@@ ion, and that is, I'm out@@ fit@@ -@@ obs@@ esse@@ d.
I love fin@@ ding, wear@@ ing, and more recently, photograph@@ ing and blog@@ ging a different, color@@ ful, crazy out@@ fit for every single occas@@ ion.
But I don't buy anything new.
I get all my clothes second@@ hand from fle@@ a markets and thri@@ ft stor@@ es.
Aw@@ w, thank you.
Secon@@ d@@ hand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my war@@ dro@@ be has on the environment and on my wal@@ let.
I get to meet all kinds of great people@@ ; my dollars usually go to a good cau@@ se@@ ; I look pretty uni@@ que@@ ; and it makes shopping like my own personal treas@@ ure hun@@ t.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it going to be my siz@@ e?
Will I like the color@@ ?
Will it be under $@@ 20@@ ?
If all the answers are yes, I feel as though I've w@@ on.
I want to get back to my suit@@ case and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED.
I mean, what does somebody with all these out@@ fits bring with her@@ ?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I br@@ ough@@ t.
I brought seven pairs of under@@ pants and that's it.
Ex@@ ac@@ tly one week@@ 's worth of un@@ dies is all I put in my suit@@ case.
I was bet@@ ting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Pal@@ m Spr@@ ings.
And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her under@@ wear - that means I found a few things.
And I'd really love to show you my week@@ 's worth of out@@ fits right now.
Does that sound good@@ ?
So as I do this, I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that, believe it or not, I have picked up in these advent@@ ures wearing nothing new.
So let's start with Sund@@ ay.
I call this "S@@ hin@@ y T@@ ig@@ er."
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $@@ 50.
This whole out@@ f@@ it, including the jack@@ et, cost me $@@ 5@@ 5, and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week.
Mon@@ day@@ : Col@@ or is powerful.
It is almost physi@@ olog@@ ically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red p@@ ants.
If you are happy, you are going to attract other happy people to you.
Tues@@ day@@ : F@@ itting in is way over@@ r@@ ated.
I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in.
Just be who you are.
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people, they will not only get it, they will appreciate it.
W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day@@ : Em@@ br@@ ace your inner child.
Sometimes people tell me that I look like I'm playing dr@@ ess@@ -@@ up, or that I remind them of their seven-@@ year-@@ old.
I like to smile and say, "Thank you."
Th@@ urs@@ day@@ : Con@@ fid@@ ence is key.
If you think you look good in something, you almost certainly do.
And if you don't think you look good in something, you're also probably right.
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day@@ -@@ in and day@@ -@@ out.
But it wasn't until I turned 30 that I really got what this me@@ ant.
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.
If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out, there is no look that you can't pull off.
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock.
Thank you.
Fr@@ id@@ ay@@ : A universal truth - five words for you: G@@ old sequ@@ ins go with everything.
And finally, Satur@@ day@@ : Develop@@ ing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
It's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm wear@@ ing, and we've had great convers@@ ations.
So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suit@@ case.
So before I go home to Brooklyn, I'm going to don@@ ate everything back.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go.
I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner, there is always going to be another crazy, color@@ ful, shin@@ y out@@ fit just waiting for me, if I put a little love in my heart and look.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Phys@@ ic@@ ists are used to the idea that sub@@ atomic particles behave according to the bizarre rules of quantum mechan@@ ics, completely different to human-@@ scale objects. In a breakthrough experiment, Aaron O'@@ Con@@ nell has blur@@ red that distinction by creating an object that is visible to the un@@ a@@ id@@ ed eye, but prov@@ ably in two places at the same time. In this talk he suggests an intriguing way of thinking about the result.
Aaron O'@@ Con@@ n@@ ell@@ : Ma@@ king sense of a visible quantum object.
This is a representation of your brain, and your brain can be broken into two parts.
There's the left half, which is the logical side, and then the right half, which is the intuiti@@ ve.
And so if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ titu@@ de of each hemis@@ phere, then we can plot our brain.
And for example, this would be somebody who's completely log@@ ical.
This would be someone who's entirely intuiti@@ ve.
So where would you put your brain on this scal@@ e?
Some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these extrem@@ es, but I think for most people in the audience, your brain is something like this - with a high ap@@ titu@@ de in both hemis@@ pher@@ es at the same time.
It's not like they're mutu@@ ally exclus@@ ive or anything.
You can be logical and intuiti@@ ve.
And so I consider myself one of these people, along with most of the other experimental quantum physic@@ ists, who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas.
But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work.
How do we develop this intui@@ tion? Well we like to play with stuff.
So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it ac@@ ts, and then we develop our intuition from there.
And really you do the same thing.
So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time.
I mean, it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this no@@ tion, you developed it.
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.
He was just a tod@@ d@@ ler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable less@@ on, and that's that large things don't let you get right past them, and that they stay in one place.
And so this is a great concep@@ tual model to have of the world, unless you're a particle physic@@ ist.
It@@ 'd be a terrible model for a particle physic@@ ist, because they don't play with car stop@@ s, they play with these little weird particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find they do all sorts of really weird things - like they can fly right through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And so they wrote down all these observ@@ ations, and they called it the theory of quantum mechan@@ ics.
And so that's where physics was at a few years ag@@ o; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little, tiny particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the large, everyday objects around us.
This didn't really sit well with my intui@@ tion, and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.
Well, I play with them sometimes, but not very often.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no@@ body's ever seen a partic@@ le.
But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.
Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechan@@ ics, then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechan@@ ic@@ s?
I don't see any reason why it shoul@@ d@@ n't.
And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechan@@ ics.
So a few years ago, I set off to do just that.
So I made one.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum super@@ position.
So what we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip.
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.
And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.
This is a photograph of the object.
And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.
And then here's a really, really big close-@@ up of the little piece of metal.
So what we're looking at is a little ch@@ unk of metal, and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a led@@ ge.
And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.
I went into a clean room with a fresh sil@@ icon wa@@ fer, and then I just cr@@ an@@ ked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine - to make this swimming po@@ ol@@ -@@ shaped hole underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum super@@ position, but it needs a little help to do it.
Here, let me give you an analog@@ y.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crow@@ ded elev@@ ator@@ ?
I mean, when I'm in an elev@@ ator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don't want to bother them, or, frankly, s@@ care them.
So quantum mechanics says that in@@ ani@@ mate objects feel the same way.
The fellow passeng@@ ers for in@@ ani@@ mate objects are not just people, but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.
And so we knew, if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechan@@ ically, we're going to have to kick out all the other pass@@ en@@ ger@@ s.
And so that's what we did.
We turned off the lights, and then we put it in a vacuum and suc@@ ked out all the air, and then we coo@@ led it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.
Now, all alone in the elev@@ ator, the little ch@@ unk of metal is free to act however it wanted.
And so we measured its motion.
We found it was moving in really weird ways.
Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibr@@ ating, and the way it was vibr@@ ating was breathing something like this - like expanding and contrac@@ ting bel@@ low@@ s.
And by giving it a gent@@ le nud@@ ge, we were able to make it both vibr@@ ate and not vibr@@ ate at the same time - something that's only allowed with quantum mechan@@ ics.
So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.
What does it mean for one thing to be both vibr@@ ating and not vibr@@ ating at the same time?
So let's think about the atom@@ s.
So in one cas@@ e: all the trilli@@ ons of atoms that make up that ch@@ unk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
Now it's only at precise times when they al@@ ig@@ n.
The rest of the time they're del@@ oc@@ aliz@@ ed.
That means that every at@@ om is in two different places at the same time, which in turn means the entire ch@@ unk of metal is in two different places.
I think this is really cool.
Re@@ ally.
It was worth loc@@ king myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because, check this out, the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and that ch@@ unk of metal is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ unk of metal and you.
So if a single at@@ om can be in two different places at the same time, that ch@@ unk of metal can be in two different places, then why not you?
I mean, this is just my logical side tal@@ king.
So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time, what would that be like?
How would your consciousness handle your body being del@@ oc@@ alized in spac@@ e?
There's one more part to the story.
It's when we war@@ med it up, and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.
And so I had to develop this new intui@@ tion, that it seems like all the objects in the elev@@ ator are really just quantum objects just cr@@ am@@ med into a tiny space.
You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all inter@@ connected.
Well, that's not quite right.
It's more than that@@ ; it's dee@@ per.
It's that those connec@@ tions, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound weir@@ d@@ ness of quantum mechan@@ ics.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Imagine being able to see art@@ work in the greatest muse@@ ums around the world without leaving your chair. D@@ ri@@ ven by his passion for art, Am@@ it So@@ od tells the story of how he developed Art Project to let people do just that.
Am@@ it So@@ od@@ : Building a museum of muse@@ ums on the web.
My name is Am@@ it.
And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google, and I pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with muse@@ ums and art to my boss who's actually here, and she allowed me to do it.
And it took 18 months.
A lot of fun, negoti@@ ations and stories, I can tell you, with 17 very interesting muse@@ ums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the dem@@ o.
There are a lot of stories about why we did this.
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide, and it's acc@@ ess.
And I grew up in India.
I had a great education - I'm not complain@@ ing - but I didn't have access to a lot of these muse@@ ums and these art@@ works.
And so when I started traveling and going to these muse@@ um@@ s, I started learning a lot.
And while working at Google, I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing this.
I'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since laun@@ ch.
So, simple@@ : you come to Goog@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ Projec@@ t@@ .com.
You look around at all these muse@@ ums here.
You've got the U@@ f@@ fiz@@ i, you've got the Mo@@ M@@ A, the Her@@ mit@@ age, the Ri@@ j@@ ks, the Van Go@@ gh@@ .
I'm going to actually get to one of my favor@@ ites, the Me@@ trop@@ olit@@ an Museum of Art in New York.
Two ways of going in - very simple.
C@@ lic@@ k and, bang@@ , you're in this muse@@ um.
It doesn't matter where you are - Bom@@ ba@@ y, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.
You move around, you have fun.
You want to navigate around the muse@@ um@@ ?
Open the plan up, and, in one clic@@ k, jum@@ p.
You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corrid@@ or.
Keep going. Have fun.
Expl@@ ore.
Thanks. I haven't come to the best part.
So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paint@@ ings, "The Harv@@ ester@@ s" by Pi@@ e@@ ter Bru@@ e@@ gel at the M@@ et.
I see this plus sig@@ n.
If the museum has given us the image, you click on it.
Now this is one of the images.
So this is all of the me@@ ta-@@ data information.
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click this - but I'm going to click this off right now.
And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gig@@ ap@@ ix@@ el technology.
So this image, for example, has close to, I think, around 10 billion pix@@ els.
And I get a lot of people asking me: "What do you get for 10 billion pix@@ el@@ s?"
So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pix@@ els.
You can zoom around very simpl@@ y.
You see some fun stuff happening here.
I love this gu@@ y; his expression is pric@@ eless.
But then you really want to go deep@@ .
And so I started playing around, and I found something going on over here.
And I was like, "H@@ old on. That sounds interest@@ ing."
W@@ ent in, and I started notic@@ ing that these kids were actually beating something.
I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contac@@ ts at the M@@ et, and actually found out that this is a game called squ@@ all, which involves beating a go@@ ose with a stick on Sh@@ ro@@ ve Tues@@ day.
And apparently it was quite popular.
I don't know why they did it, but I learned something about it.
Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the crack@@ s.
Now just to give you some perspective, I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.
Here is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is yet to come - so in a second.
So now let's just quickly jump into the Mo@@ M@@ A, again in New York.
So another one of my favor@@ ites, "The Star@@ ry N@@ igh@@ t."
Now the example I showed you was all about finding deta@@ ils.
But what if you want to see brush strok@@ es?
And what if you want to see how Van G@@ og@@ h actually created this master@@ piec@@ e?
You zoom in. You really go in.
I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this pain@@ ting, and I'm really going to get to the crack@@ s.
This is "The Star@@ ry N@@ ight@@ ," I think, never seen like this before.
I'm going to show you my other favorite fe@@ ature.
There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.
This is the real cool part. It's called Col@@ lec@@ tions.
Any one of you, anybody - doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor, if you have a fancy house - doesn't matter.
You can go and create your own museum online - create your own collection across all these images.
Very simply, you go in - and I've created this, called The Po@@ wer of Zo@@ om - you can just zoom around.
This is "The Amb@@ ass@@ ador@@ s," based in the National Gall@@ ery.
You can an@@ not@@ ate the stuff, send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these master@@ pieces.
So I think, in conclus@@ ion, for me, the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.
It does@@ n't, in my opinion, even come from the muse@@ um@@ s.
I probably shouldn't say that.
It really comes from these artist@@ s.
And that's been my hum@@ bling experience in this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their art@@ work and represent it properly online.
And the biggest question I get asked nowad@@ ays is, "Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a muse@@ um@@ ?"
And the answer is no.
It's to supple@@ ment the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: With his team at SE@@ N@@ SE@@ able City Lab, MI@@ T@@ 's Car@@ lo R@@ att@@ i makes cool things by sensing the data we create. He pulls from passive data sets - like the calls we make, the garbage we throw away - to create surprising visualiz@@ ations of city life. And he and his team create d@@ azz@@ ling interactive environments from moving water and flying light, powered by simple gest@@ ures caught through sensor@@ s.
Car@@ lo R@@ at@@ ti@@ : Architec@@ ture that senses and respon@@ ds.
Good afternoon, everybody.
I've got something to show you.
Think about this as a pix@@ el, a flying pix@@ el.
This is what we call, in our lab, sensi@@ ble design.
Let me tell you a bit about it.
Now if you take this picture - I'm Italian origin@@ ally, and every boy in Ital@@ y grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedro@@ om - but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in For@@ mul@@ a 1 racing over the past couple of decades.
Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a For@@ mul@@ a 1 race, you take a budget, and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car.
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.
Now today, if you want to win the race, actually you need also something like this - something that monit@@ ors the car in real time, has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car, transmit@@ ting this information into the system, and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collec@@ ted.
This is what, in engineering terms, you would call a real time control system.
And basically, it's a system made of two components - a sensing and an actu@@ ating compon@@ ent.
What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives.
Our cities, over the past few years, just have been bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ted with networks, electron@@ ics.
They're becoming like computers in open air.
And, as computers in open air, they're starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sen@@ sed and to be actu@@ ated.
If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.
Just as an as@@ ide, I wanted to men@@ tion, cities are only two percent of the Earth's crus@@ t, but they are 50 percent of the world's population.
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption - up to 80 percent of CO2 emis@@ sions.
So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.
B@@ ey@@ on@@ d cities, all of this sensing and actu@@ ating is entering our everyday objects.
That's from an exhibition that Pa@@ ola Anton@@ ell@@ i is organizing at MoMA later this year, during the summer.
It's called "@@ Talk to M@@ e."
Well our objects, our environment is starting to talk back to us.
In a certain sense, it's almost as if every at@@ om out there were becoming both a sensor and an actu@@ ator.
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there.
In a certain sense, it's almost as if the old dream of Michel@@ ang@@ elo ...
You know, when Michel@@ ang@@ elo sculp@@ ted the Mos@@ es, at the end it said that he took the ham@@ mer, threw it at the Mos@@ es - actually you can still see a small chip underneath - and said, sh@@ ou@@ ted, "@@ Per@@ ch@@ é no@@ n parli@@ ? Why don't you tal@@ k@@ ?"
Well today, for the first time, our environment is starting to talk back to us.
And I'll show just a few examples - again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actu@@ ating it.
Let's starting with sens@@ ing.
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab.
It was four and a half years ago in Ital@@ y.
And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world - that's a cell@@ phone network - and use anonymous and aggreg@@ ated information from that network, that's collected any@@ way by the oper@@ ator, in order to understand how the city works.
The summer was a lucky summer - 2006.
It's when Ital@@ y won the soccer World C@@ up.
Some of you might remember, it was Ital@@ y and France play@@ ing, and then Z@@ id@@ ane at the end, the head@@ but@@ t.
And anyway, Ital@@ y won at the end.
Now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network.
Here you see the city.
You see the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um in the middle, the river T@@ ib@@ er.
It's morning, before the mat@@ ch.
You see the timel@@ ine on the top.
Ear@@ ly afternoon, people here and there, making calls and moving.
The match begins - silence.
France s@@ cores. Ital@@ y s@@ cores.
Hal@@ f@@ time, people make a quick call and go to the bathro@@ om.
Second half. E@@ nd of normal time.
First over@@ time, second.
Z@@ id@@ ane, the head@@ but@@ t in a moment.
Ital@@ y win@@ s. Yeah.
Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.
You saw the big pe@@ ak.
The following day, again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time.
And then everybody moved down.
You see the image of the place called Cir@@ co M@@ assim@@ o, where, since Roman times, people go to celebr@@ ate, to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.
Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn't have done just a few years ago.
Another quick example about sen@@ sing@@ : it's not about people, but about things we use and consum@@ e.
Well today, we know everything about where our objects come from.
This is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we actually developed some small tag@@ s to track trash as it moves through the system.
So we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle, just over a year ago, to tag what they were throwing away - different types of things, as you can see here - things they would throw away anyway.
Then we put a little chip, little tag@@ , onto the trash and then started following it.
Here are the results we just obtain@@ ed.
From Seattle ...
After one week.
With this information we realized there's a lot of in@@ effici@@ encies in the system.
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy.
This data was not available before.
But there's a lot of was@@ ted transportation and con@@ volu@@ ted things happening.
But the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappe@@ ar, it's still somewhere on the planet.
And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.
And if we show that to people, then we can also promote some behavioral change.
So that was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, As@@ sa@@ f B@@ ider@@ man, he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sens@@ ing, but I wanted to go to the second part we discus@@ sed at the beginning, and that's actu@@ ating our environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Z@@ ar@@ ag@@ o@@ za, S@@ pain.
It started with a question by the mayor of the city, who came to us saying that S@@ pain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was: How could technology, new technology, be added to that?
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a work@@ shop was, imagine this pi@@ pe, and you've got val@@ ves, sol@@ eno@@ id val@@ ves, tap@@ s, opening and clos@@ ing.
You create like a water cur@@ tain with pix@@ els made of water.
If those pix@@ els fall, you can write on it, you can show patterns, images, text.
And even you can approach it, and it will open up to let you jump through, as you see in this image.
Well, we presented this to May@@ or B@@ ell@@ oc@@ h.
He liked it very much.
And we got a com@@ mission to design a building at the entr@@ ance of the exp@@ o.
We called it Digital W@@ ater P@@ av@@ il@@ ion.
The whole building is made of water.
There's no doors or windo@@ ws, but when you approach it, it will open up to let you in.
The roof also is covered with water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minim@@ ize spl@@ ash@@ ing, you can actually lower the ro@@ of.
Or you could close the building, and the whole architecture will disappe@@ ar, like in this case.
You know, these days, you always get images during the winter@@ , when they take the roof down, of people who have been there and said, "@@ They demol@@ ished the build@@ ing."
No, they didn't demol@@ ish it, just when it goes down, the architecture almost disappear@@ s.
Here's the building working.
You see the person puzz@@ led about what was going on inside.
And here was myself trying not to get w@@ et, testing the sensors that open the water.
Well, I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working.
But actually that night, it was even more fun.
All the kids from Z@@ ar@@ ag@@ o@@ za came to the building, because the way of engaging with the building became something different.
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in, but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water, and you had to jump without getting w@@ et.
And that was, for us, was very interesting, because, as architec@@ ts, as engineers, as designers, we always think about how people will use the things we design.
But then real@@ it@@ y's always un@@ predic@@ table.
And that's the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people.
Here is an image then of the building with the physical pix@@ els, the pix@@ els made of water, and then projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the following project I'll show you now.
That@@ 's, imagine those pix@@ els could actually start fl@@ ying.
Imagine you could have small helicop@@ ters that move in the air, and then each of them with a small pix@@ el in changing lights - almost as a cloud that can move in space.
Here is the video.
So imagine one helicop@@ ter, like the one we saw before, moving with others, in synchron@@ y.
So you can have this cloud.
You can have a kind of flexible screen or dis@@ play, like this - a regular configur@@ ation in two dimensions.
Or in regular, but in three dimension@@ s, where the thing that changes is the light, not the pix@@ el@@ s' position.
You can play with a different ty@@ pe.
Imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or siz@@ es, different types of resolu@@ tion.
But then the whole thing can be just a 3D cloud of pix@@ els that you can approach and move through it and see from many, many directions.
Here is the real F@@ ly@@ fire control and going down to form the regular grid as before.
When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.
And imagine each of them then controlled by people.
You can have each pix@@ el having an input that comes from people, from people's movement, or so and so.
I want to show you something here for the first time.
We've been working with Rob@@ erto Bol@@ le, one of today's top bal@@ let dan@@ cers - the é@@ to@@ ile at Me@@ trop@@ olit@@ an in New York and La S@@ cal@@ a in Mil@@ an - and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for F@@ ly@@ fire.
And here you can see Rob@@ erto danc@@ ing.
You see on the left the pix@@ els, the different resolu@@ tions being cap@@ ture@@ d.
It's both 3D scanning in real time and motion cap@@ ture.
So you can re@@ construct a whole movement.
You can go all the way through.
But then, once we have the pix@@ els, then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rot@@ ation.
So we want to use this as one of the possible in@@ puts for F@@ ly@@ fire.
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.
It's something we're working on for the London Olympic@@ s.
It's called The C@@ lou@@ d.
And the idea here is, imagine, again, we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment - almost to im@@ part what we call cloud raising - like bar@@ n rais@@ ing, but with a cloud.
Imagine you can have everybody make a small don@@ ation for one pix@@ el.
And I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that, over the past couple of decades, we went from the physical world to the digital one.
This has been digitiz@@ ing everything, knowledge, and making that accessible through the Internet.
Now today, for the first time - and the Obama campaign showed us this - we can go from the digital world, from the self-@@ organizing power of networks, to the physical one.
This can be, in our case, we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol@@ .
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be, in order to tackle today's pressing challenges - think about climate change or CO2 emissions - how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.
So the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together, collec@@ tively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pix@@ els, in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles.
And those particles are water, where our cloud is a cloud of pix@@ els.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pix@@ els.
You can move inside, have different types of experiences.
You can actually see from undernea@@ th, sharing the main moments for the Olympic@@ s in 20@@ 12 and beyon@@ d, and really using it as a way to connect with the community.
So both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top [@@ of@@ ], like London@@ 's new mountain@@ top.
You can enter inside it.
And a kind of new digital be@@ aco@@ n for the night - but most importantly, a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Medical eth@@ ic@@ ist Har@@ vey F@@ ine@@ berg shows us three paths forward for the ever-@@ evolving human speci@@ es: to stop evolving comple@@ tely, to evolve naturally - or to control the next steps of human evolution, using genetic modific@@ ation, to make ourselves smar@@ ter, faster, better. Ne@@ o-@@ evolution is within our gras@@ p. What will we do with it?
Har@@ vey F@@ ine@@ ber@@ g: Are we ready for ne@@ o-@@ evolu@@ tion?
How would you like to be better than you are?
Suppose I said that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could get a better memory - more precis@@ e, more accurate and quick@@ er.
Or maybe you'd like to be more f@@ it, strong@@ er, with more stam@@ ina.
Would you like to be more attractive and self-@@ confid@@ ent@@ ?
How about living longer with good health@@ ?
Or perhaps you're one of those who's always year@@ ned for more creativity.
Which one would you like the mos@@ t?
Which would you like, if you could have just one?
Cre@@ ativ@@ ity.
How many people would choose creativ@@ ity?
Ra@@ ise your hands. Let me see.
A fe@@ w. Probably about as many as there are creative people here.
That's very good.
How many would op@@ t for memor@@ y?
Quite a few more.
How about fit@@ ness@@ ?
A few less.
What about longe@@ vit@@ y?
Ah, the major@@ ity. That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have any one of these, it would be a very different world.
Is it just imagin@@ ar@@ y?
Or, is it, perhaps, possible?
Evolu@@ tion has been a per@@ enni@@ al topic here at the TED Confer@@ ence, but I want to give you today one doctor@@ 's take on the subject.
The great 20@@ th-century genetic@@ ist, T.@@ G. D@@ ob@@ z@@ h@@ ans@@ ky, who was also a communic@@ ant in the Russian Or@@ th@@ od@@ o@@ x Chur@@ ch, once wrote an ess@@ ay that he tit@@ led "@@ Nothing in Bi@@ ology Ma@@ kes Sen@@ se Except in the L@@ ight of Evolu@@ tion."
Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution, this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid, take out your personal communications device - I give you permission - and perhaps take another look at Kathr@@ yn Sch@@ ul@@ tz@@ 's book on being wrong, because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatso@@ ever to you.
But if you do accept biological evolution, consider this: is it just about the past, or is it about the future?
Does it apply to others, or does it apply to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
In this picture, I've put a bus@@ h with a center bran@@ ching out in all direc@@ tions, because if you look at the edges of the tree of life, every existing species at the tips of those branches has succee@@ ded in evolutionary ter@@ m@@ s: it has survi@@ ve@@ d; it has demonstrated a fit@@ ness to its environment.
The human part of this bran@@ ch, way out on one end, is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.
We branch off of a common ancest@@ or to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the interv@@ al, there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of homin@@ ids.
Some have come and gone.
We have been here for about 1@@ 30,000 years.
It may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, for the most part, the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same.
Do you realize that we can take advantage and com@@ man@@ de@@ er the machinery of a common bacteri@@ um to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diab@@ e@@ tic@@ s?
This is not like human insul@@ in@@ ; this is the same protein that is chem@@ ically ind@@ ist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ able from what comes out of your pancre@@ as.
And speaking of bacteria, do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our bod@@ y?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean think of it, when Anton@@ io Dam@@ as@@ io asks about your self-@@ image, do you think about the bacteri@@ a?
Our gut is a wonder@@ fully hospit@@ able environment for those bacteria.
It's war@@ m, it's dark, it's mo@@ ist, it's very coz@@ y.
And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part.
It's really like an Eas@@ y Street for bacteria, with the occasion@@ al interrup@@ tion of the unintended forced rush to the ex@@ it.
But other@@ wise, you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria, just as they are essential to your life.
They help in the dig@@ es@@ tion of essential nutri@@ ents, and they protect you against certain diseases.
But what will come in the future?
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equi@@ po@@ ise as a speci@@ es?
Or, are we destin@@ ed to become something different - something, perhaps, even better adapted to the environment@@ ?
Now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago - the Earth, the solar system, about four and a half billion years - the first signs of pro@@ to-@@ life, maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth - the first multi-@@ cel@@ led organisms, perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago - and then the human species, finally emerging in the last 1@@ 30,000 years.
In this vast un@@ finished sym@@ phony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief measure@@ ; the animal king@@ dom, like a single measure@@ ; and human life, a small gr@@ ace note.
That was us.
That also constitu@@ tes the entertainment portion of this talk, so I hope you enjoyed it.
Now when I was a fresh@@ man in college, I took my first biology class.
I was fascinated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology.
I became en@@ amor@@ ed of the power of evolution, and I realized something very fundament@@ al: in most of the existence of life in single-@@ cel@@ led organisms, each cell simply divid@@ es, and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells.
But at the time multi-@@ cel@@ led organisms come online, things start to change.
Sex@@ ual re@@ production enters the picture.
And very importantly, with the introduction of sexual re@@ production that passes on the genome, the rest of the body becomes expen@@ d@@ able.
In fact, you could say that the inevit@@ ability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual re@@ production.
Now I have to conf@@ ess, when I was a college under@@ gradu@@ ate, I thought, okay, sex@@ /@@ death, sex@@ /@@ death, death for sex - it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with each passing year, I've come to have increasing doub@@ ts.
I've come to understand the senti@@ ments of George Bur@@ ns, who was performing still in Las Veg@@ as well into his 90@@ s.
And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door.
He answers the door.
St@@ anding before him is a gorge@@ ous, scan@@ ti@@ ly cl@@ ad show@@ girl.
She looks at him and says, "I'm here for super sex@@ ."
"That's fin@@ e," says Georg@@ e, "I'll take the sou@@ p@@ ."
I came to realiz@@ e, as a physici@@ an, that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution - not necessarily contradic@@ tor@@ y, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to keep us healthy.
I wanted to restore health from disease.
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives.
Evolu@@ tion is all about passing on the genome to the next generation, adap@@ ting and surviv@@ ing through generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like the bo@@ os@@ ter rock@@ ets designed to send the genetic pay@@ load into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea.
I think we would all understand the senti@@ ment that Wo@@ ody Allen expressed when he said, "I don't want to achieve im@@ mortality through my work.
I want to achieve it through not dy@@ ing."
Evolu@@ tion does not necessarily favor the long@@ est-@@ li@@ ved.
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strong@@ est or the fas@@ test, and not even the smar@@ test.
Evolu@@ tion fav@@ ors those creatures best adapted to their environment.
That is the so@@ le test of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean, bacteria that are ther@@ mo@@ phil@@ ic and can survive at the steam v@@ ent heat that would otherwise produc@@ e, if fish were there, s@@ ous@@ -@@ vide coo@@ ked fish, neverth@@ eless, have managed to make that a hospit@@ able environment for them.
So what does this mean, as we look back at what has happened in evolution, and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution, and particularly as we look ahead to the next phas@@ e, I would say that there are a number of possibilities.
The first is that we will not evol@@ ve.
We have reached a kind of equi@@ pois@@ e.
And the reason@@ ing behind that would be, first, we have, through medicine, managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population.
And secon@@ dly, we as a species have so con@@ figured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we immigr@@ ate and circul@@ ate and inter@@ mix so much that you can't any longer have the isol@@ ation that is necessary for evolution to take place.
A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind, natural, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind slowly, but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able.
And as far as isol@@ ation goes, when we as a species do colon@@ ize distant planets, there will be the isol@@ ation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way.
But there's a third possibil@@ ity, an entic@@ ing, intriguing and frighten@@ ing possibil@@ ity.
I call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution - the new evolution that is not simply natural, but guid@@ ed and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make.
Now how could this come about?
How could it be possible that we would do this?
Consid@@ er, first, the reality that people today, in some cultures, are making choices about their off@@ spring.
They@@ '@@ re, in some cultures, choosing to have more males than femal@@ es.
It's not necessarily good for the society, but it's what the individual and the family are choos@@ ing.
Think also, if it were possible ever for you to choos@@ e, not simply to choose the sex of your child, but for you in your body to make the genetic ad@@ just@@ ments that would cure or prevent diseases.
What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stro@@ ke@@ ?
Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your gen@@ es?
If we look ahead, these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Geno@@ me Project started in 1990, and it took 13 years.
It cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars.
The year after it was finished in 2004, you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months.
Today, you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week.
It won't be very long before the reality will be the 1,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ dollar human genome, and it will be increasingly available for everyone.
Just a week ago, the National Academy of Engine@@ ering awar@@ ded its D@@ rap@@ er Prize to Francis Ar@@ n@@ old and W@@ ill@@ em S@@ tem@@ mer, two scientists who independ@@ ently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desir@@ able proteins in a more efficient way - what Fr@@ ances Ar@@ n@@ old calls "@@ direc@@ ted evolu@@ tion."
A couple of years ago, the L@@ ask@@ er Prize was awar@@ ded to the scientist Sh@@ in@@ ya Y@@ aman@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took an adult skin cell, a fi@@ bro@@ bl@@ ast, and by manipul@@ ating just four genes, he induc@@ ed that cell to rever@@ t to a pluri@@ potential stem cell - a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body.
These changes are coming.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves, but indu@@ ce immun@@ ity against other vir@@ uses.
Beli@@ eve it or not, there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influ@@ en@@ za that has been grown in the cells of a to@@ bac@@ co plant.
Can you imagine something good coming out of to@@ bac@@ co?
These are all reality today, and [in@@ ] the future, will be ever@@ more possible.
Imagine then just two other little changes.
You can change the cells in your body, but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ spr@@ ing?
What if you could change the sperm and the ov@@ a, or change the newly fertiliz@@ ed eg@@ g, and give your off@@ spring a better chance at a healthier life - eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hem@@ oph@@ il@@ ia, reduce the risk of cancer@@ ?
Who doesn't want healthier childr@@ en?
And then, that same analy@@ tic technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease, will also enable us to adopt super-@@ at@@ tribut@@ es, hyper-@@ capac@@ ities - that better memory.
Why not have the quick w@@ it of a Ken J@@ enn@@ ings, especially if you can aug@@ ment it with the next generation of the Watson machin@@ e?
Why not have the quick twit@@ ch muscle that will enable you to run faster and lon@@ ger@@ ?
Why not live lon@@ ger@@ ?
These will be ir@@ resis@@ ti@@ ble.
And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation, and we can adopt the attribu@@ tes we want, we will have converted old-@@ style evolution into ne@@ o-@@ evolution.
We'll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years, and we can com@@ press it down to a thousand years - and maybe even in the next 100 years.
These are choices that your grand@@ children, or their grand@@ children, are going to have before them.
Will we use these choices to make a society that is better, that is more successful, that is kin@@ der@@ ?
Or, will we selec@@ tively choose different attribu@@ tes that we want for some of us and not for others of us?
Will we make a society that is more boring and more uni@@ form, or more robust and more vers@@ ati@@ le?
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face.
And most profoundly of all, will we ever be able to develop the wis@@ dom, and to inher@@ it the wis@@ dom, that we'll need to make these choices wis@@ el@@ y?
For better or worse, and sooner than you may think, these choices will be up to us.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: R@@ ic Eli@@ as had a fron@@ t-@@ row seat on F@@ light 15@@ 4@@ 9, the plane that crash@@ -l@@ an@@ ded in the Hudson River in New York in January 2009. What went through his mind as the do@@ o@@ med plane went down@@ ? At TED, he tells his story publicly for the first time.
R@@ ic Eli@@ as: 3 things I learned while my plane crash@@ ed.
Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 f@@ t.
Imagine a plane full of smo@@ ke.
Imagine an engine going cl@@ ac@@ k, cl@@ ac@@ k, cl@@ ac@@ k.
It sounds scar@@ y.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in 1@@ D.
I was the only one who could talk to the flight attend@@ ants.
So I looked at them right away, and they said, "No problem. We probably hit some bir@@ d@@ s."
The pilot had already turned the plane around, and we weren't that far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson Ri@@ ver.
That's usually not the rou@@ te.
He turns off the eng@@ ines.
Now, imagine being in a plane with no sound.
And then he says three words.
The most un@@ emotional three words I've ever heard.
He says, "@@ Br@@ ace for impac@@ t."
I didn't have to talk to the flight attend@@ ant anymore.
I could see in her eyes, it was terror.
Life was over.
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it all changes in an inst@@ ant.
We have this buc@@ ket list, we have these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I did@@ n't, all the f@@ ences I wanted to men@@ d, all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did.
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a saying, which is, "I collect bad win@@ es."
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it.
I no longer want to post@@ p@@ one anything in life.
And that ur@@ genc@@ y, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day - and this is as we clear the George Washington Br@@ id@@ ge, which was by not a lot - I thought about, wo@@ w, I really feel one real regre@@ t.
I've lived a good life.
In my own humanity and mistak@@ es, I've tried to get better at everything I tri@@ ed.
But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in.
And I regre@@ t@@ ted the time I was@@ ted on things that did not matter with people that matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And after, as I reflected on that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
I've not had a fight with my wife in two years.
It feels great.
I no longer try to be right@@ ; I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned - and this is as your mental clock starts going, "@@ 15, 14, 13@@ ."
You can see the water coming.
I'm saying, "P@@ lease blow up."
I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you've seen in those document@@ aries.
And as we're coming down, I had a sense of, wo@@ w, dying is not scar@@ y.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives.
But it was very s@@ ad.
I didn't want to go@@ ; I love my life.
And that sad@@ ness really fr@@ amed in one thought, which is, I only wish for one thing.
I only wish I could see my kids grow up.
About a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter - first-@@ grad@@ er, not much artistic talent - Y@@ et@@ !
And I'm ba@@ w@@ ling, I'm cr@@ ying, like a little kid.
And it made all the sense in the world to me.
I realized at that point, by connecting those two do@@ ts, that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad@@ .
A@@ bo@@ ve all, above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad@@ .
I was given the gift of a mirac@@ le, of not dying that day.
I was given another gif@@ t, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently.
I challenge you guys that are flying today, imagine the same thing happens on your plane - and please don't - but imagine, and how would you change?
What would you get done that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here for@@ ever@@ ?
How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them?
And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can@@ ?
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The nerve disease AL@@ S left graf@@ fit@@ i artist TE@@ MP@@ T paralyzed from head to to@@ e, forced to communicate bl@@ ink by blin@@ k. In a remarkable talk at TED@@ Ac@@ tive, entrepreneur M@@ ick E@@ bel@@ ing shares how he and a team of collabor@@ ators built an open-source invention that gave the artist - and gives others in his circumst@@ ance - the means to make art again.
M@@ ick E@@ bel@@ ing: The invention that un@@ locked a lock@@ ed-@@ in artist.
I have had the distinct bl@@ essing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.
But the cool@@ est I ever worked on was around this guy.
This guy's name is TE@@ MP@@ T.
TE@@ MP@@ T was one of the for@@ em@@ ost graf@@ fit@@ i artists in the 80@@ s.
And he came up home from a run one day and said, "D@@ ad, my legs are t@@ ingl@@ ing."
And that was the on@@ set of AL@@ S.
So TE@@ MP@@ T is now completely paraly@@ z@@ ed.
He only has use of his eyes.
I was exposed to him.
I have a company that does design and anima@@ tion, so obviously graf@@ fit@@ i is definitely an intric@@ ate part of what we admir@@ e and respect in the art world.
And so we decided that we were going to spon@@ sor Ton@@ y, TE@@ MP@@ T, and his cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with it?"
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "W@@ a@@ it a second, isn't that - I've seen Stephen Hawking - don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these dev@@ ic@@ es?"
And he said, "No, unless you're in the upper e@@ ch@@ el@@ on and you've got really amazing insur@@ ance, you can't actually do that.
These devices aren't accessible to people@@ ."
And I said, "Well, how do you actually communic@@ ate@@ ?"
Has everyone seen the movie "The D@@ iving Bell and the But@@ ter@@ fl@@ y?"
That's how they communicate - so run their finger along.
I said, "That's arch@@ a@@ ic. How can that be@@ ?"
So I showed up with the desire to just write a chec@@ k, and instead, I wrote a check that I had no fre@@ aking idea how I was going to cas@@ h.
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there - I'm like, "All right, here's the de@@ al: Ton@@ y's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine, and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.
Because it's a trav@@ est@@ y that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it."
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that.
I met these guys called G@@ R@@ L, Gr@@ af@@ fit@@ i Research Lab, and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then, with a laser po@@ inter@@ , draw on it, and it just regis@@ ters the negative space.
So they go around and do art install@@ ations like this.
All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle.
First it starts with the sexual organ@@ s, then it starts with cus@@ s words, then it was Bush s@@ land@@ ers and then people actually got to art.
But there was always a life cycle to their present@@ ations.
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this, and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things, why don't we figure out a way for TE@@ MP@@ T to control a laser and he could do gra@@ f again? Well that would be awesome@@ ."
So that started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around, we'd accomplished a couple things.
One, we bat@@ tered down the doors of the insurance companies, and we actually got TE@@ MP@@ T a machine that let him communicate - a Stephen Hawking machine.
Which was awesome.
And he's seriously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est - I call him Y@@ od@@ a, because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him, and you're like, "I'm not worth@@ y. This guy's so amaz@@ ing."
The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world - literally every corner of the world - into our house.
My wife and kids and I moved to our back gar@@ age, and these hackers and programmers and conspir@@ acy theor@@ ists and an@@ arch@@ ists took over our house.
A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and gra@@ f on the walls.
But for over two weeks, we program@@ med, we went to the Ven@@ ice boar@@ d@@ walk, my kids got involved, my dog got involved, and we created this.
This is called the E@@ ye@@ W@@ rit@@ er, and you can see the descrip@@ tion.
This is a cheap pair of sun@@ glasses that we bought at the Ven@@ ice Be@@ ach boar@@ d@@ walk, some cop@@ per wire and some stuff from Ho@@ me De@@ pot and Rad@@ io Sh@@ ac@@ k.
We took a P@@ S@@ 3 camera, hac@@ ked it open, mounted it to an LED light, and now there's a device that is free - you build this yourself, we publish the code for free, you download the software for free.
And now we've created a device that has absolutely no limit@@ ations.
There's no insurance company that can say "No."
There's no hospital that can say "No."
Anybody who's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you guys very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to TE@@ M@@ PT@@ 's room.
I love this picture, because this is someone else's room and that's his room.
So there's all this hus@@ tle and bus@@ tle going on for the big unve@@ il@@ ing.
And after over a year of plan@@ ning, two weeks of program@@ ming, carb@@ -@@ f@@ est and all-@@ night sess@@ ions, Tony drew again for the first time in seven years.
And this is an amazing picture, because this is his life support system, and he's looking over his life support system.
We kicked his bed so that he could see out.
And we set up a projec@@ tor on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital.
And he drew again for the first time, in front of his family and friends - and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was.
The funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too, so we totally felt like we were leg@@ it in the whole gra@@ f scene too.
So at the end of this, he sent us an email, and this is what the email sa@@ id: "That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years.
I feel like I had been held under@@ water, and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could brea@@ the@@ ."
Isn't that awesome@@ ?
So that's kind of our battle cr@@ y.
That's what keeps us going and keeps us develop@@ ing.
And we've got such a long way to go with this.
This is an amazing device, but it's the equivalent of an E@@ t@@ ch A S@@ ket@@ ch.
And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more.
So we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better, faster, strong@@ er.
Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowled@@ g@@ ment.
We've won a bunch of awar@@ ds.
Remember, it's free@@ ; none of us are making any money on this thing.
It's all coming out of our own pocket@@ s.
So the a@@ wards were like, "Oh, this is fantas@@ tic@@ ."
Armstrong Twit@@ tered about us, and then in Dec@@ emb@@ er, Time magazine honor@@ ed us as one of the top 50 inven@@ tions of 2010, which was really cool.
The cool@@ est thing about this - and this is what's comple@@ ting the whole circle - is that in A@@ pri@@ l of this year, at the G@@ ef@@ f@@ en MO@@ CA in downtown Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called "@@ Art of the Street@@ s."
And "@@ Art of the Street@@ s" is going to have pretty much the bad@@ -@@ asses of the street art scene - B@@ ank@@ s@@ y, She@@ par@@ d Fa@@ ire@@ y, K@@ A@@ W@@ S - all of these guys will be there.
TE@@ M@@ PT@@ 's going to be in the show, which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my poin@@ t: If you see something that's not possible, make it possible.
Everything in this room wasn't possible - this stage, this computer, this mic@@ , the E@@ ye@@ W@@ ri@@ ter - wasn't possible at one point.
Make it possible, everyone in this room.
I'm not a program@@ mer, never done anything with oc@@ ular recognition technology, but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen.
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be don@@ e: if not now, then wh@@ en? And if not me, then wh@@ o?
Thank you guys.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: With humor and persist@@ ence, film@@ maker M@@ organ S@@ pur@@ lock di@@ ves into the hidden but influ@@ ential world of brand marketing, on his quest to make a completely sponsor@@ ed film about sponsor@@ ship.
M@@ organ S@@ pur@@ loc@@ k: The greatest TED Talk ever sol@@ d.
I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous.
I went to prison - difficult.
I worked in a coal mine - dangerous.
I filmed in war zones - difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this - fun in the beginning, little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end.
In fact, most of my career, I've been immer@@ sing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engag@@ ing, that make them interesting, that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertain@@ ing and accessible to an audience.
So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of br@@ anding and sponsor@@ ship, I knew I would want to do something a little different.
So as some of you may or may not have heard, a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on e@@ B@@ ay.
I sent out some Facebook mess@@ ages, some Twitter mess@@ ages, and I gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights to my 201@@ 1 TED Tal@@ k.
That's right, some lucky individual, corpor@@ ation, for-@@ profit or non-@@ prof@@ it, was going to get the on@@ ce-@@ in-@@ a-@@ lifetime opportunity - because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again - to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you're watching right now, that at the time didn't have a tit@@ le, didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really give much hin@@ t as to what the subject matter would actually be.
So what you were getting was this: Your name here present@@ s: My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face, especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it.
But that being said, it's a very good media opportunity.
You know how many people watch these TED Tal@@ k@@ s?
It's a lot.
That's just a working tit@@ le, by the way.
So even with that cav@@ eat, I knew that someone would buy the nam@@ ing rights.
Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certain@@ ty.
But in the new project that I'm working on, my new film, we examine the world of marketing, advertis@@ ing.
And as I said earlier, I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me, for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
M@@ organ S@@ pur@@ loc@@ k: What I want to do is make a film all about product plac@@ ement, marketing and advertis@@ ing, where the entire film is funded by product plac@@ ement, marketing and advertis@@ ing.
So the movie will be called "The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver Sol@@ d."
So what happens in "The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver Sol@@ d@@ ," is that everything from top to bottom, from start to fin@@ ish, is bran@@ ded from beginning to end - from the abo@@ ve-@@ the-@@ title spon@@ sor that you'll see in the movie, which is brand X.
Now this br@@ and, the Qual@@ com@@ m St@@ adi@@ um, the Sta@@ ples Center ...
These people will be married to the film in perpetu@@ ity - forever.
And so the film explores this whole idea - It's what? In perpetu@@ ity, for@@ ever@@ ?
I'm a redund@@ ant person. That was more for emphas@@ is.
It was, "In perpetu@@ ity. For@@ ever@@ ."
But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor@@ , but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.
So maybe we sell a sho@@ e and it becomes the greatest sho@@ e you ever wore ...
The greatest car you ever drove from "The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver Sol@@ d@@ ," the greatest drink you've ever had, cour@@ tes@@ y of "The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver Sol@@ d."
X@@ avi@@ er K@@ och@@ har@@ : So the idea is, beyond just showing that br@@ ands are a part of your life, but actually get them to finance the film@@ ? MS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work.
The goal of this whole film is transpar@@ ency.
You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie.
So that's the whole concept, the whole film, start to fin@@ ish.
And I would love for CE@@ G to help make it happen.
Robert Fried@@ man: You know it's funny, because when I first hear it, it is the ultimate respect for an audience.
Gu@@ y: I don't know how recep@@ tive people are going to be to it, though.
X@@ K: Do you have a perspective - I don't want to use "@@ ang@@ le@@ " because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation - but do you know how this is going to play out? David Coh@@ n: How much money does it take to do this?
MS: 1.5 million. John Kam@@ en: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them, but I think it's certainly worth pursuing a couple big, really obvious brand@@ s.
X@@ K: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out, we look like a bunch of bli@@ ther@@ ing idi@@ ots.
MS: What do you think the response is going to be?
Stu@@ art R@@ ud@@ er@@ fer@@ : The responses mostly will be "@@ no@@ ."
MS: But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me?
J@@ K: Bo@@ th.
MS: ... Mean@@ ing not so optim@@ istic.
So, s@@ ir, can you help me? I need help.
MK: I can help you.
MS: Okay. Aw@@ eso@@ me.
MK: We've gotta figure out which brand@@ s.
MS: Yeah. When you look at the people you deal with ..
MK: We've got some places we can go. Turn the camera off.
MS: I thought "@@ Turn the camera off@@ " me@@ ant, "Let's have an off-@@ the-@@ record convers@@ ation."
Turns out it really means, "We want nothing to do with your mo@@ vie@@ ."
MS: And just like that, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappear@@ ed.
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie.
I was amaz@@ ed.
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.
And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertis@@ ing, was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible, to get as many people to see it as possible.
Especi@@ ally in today's world, this intersection of new media and old media and the fr@@ actu@@ red media landscape, isn't the idea to get that new bu@@ zz@@ -@@ worthy delivery vehicle that's going to get that message to the mass@@ es?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had one fatal fla@@ w, and that fla@@ w was this.
Actually no, that was not the fla@@ w whatsoever.
That wouldn't have been a problem at all.
This would have been fine.
But what this image represents was the problem.
See, when you do a Google image search for transparency, this is -- This is one of the first images that comes up.
So I like the way you rol@@ l, Serge@@ y Br@@ in. No.
This is was the problem: transparency - free from preten@@ se or dece@@ it; easily detec@@ ted or seen through@@ ; read@@ ily understo@@ od@@ ; character@@ ized by visi@@ bility or access@@ i@@ bility of information, especially concer@@ ning business practices - that last line being probably the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days.
Our politicians say it, our president says it, even our CE@@ O@@ 's say it.
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality, something suddenly changes.
But why? Well, transparency is scary - like that od@@ d, stil@@ l-@@ scre@@ aming be@@ ar.
It's un@@ predictable - like this odd country road.
And it's also very ris@@ k@@ y.
What else is ris@@ k@@ y?
E@@ ating an entire bowl of Co@@ ol Whi@@ p.
That's very ris@@ k@@ y.
Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our stor@@ y."
See, when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie - and there he is giving me the look he often gave me - he would say, "S@@ on, there's three sides to every story.
There's your story, there's my story and there's the real stor@@ y."
Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me - and that's only because I knew John Bon@@ d and Richard Kir@@ sh@@ en@@ ba@@ um for years - I realized that I would have to go on my own, I'd have to cut out the midd@@ le@@ man and go to the companies myself with all of my team.
So what you suddenly started to realize - or what I started to realize - is that when you started having conversations with these companies, the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood film@@ s, and I have friends who make little independent films like I make.
And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have.
And then my friends who make small independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movi@@ es?"
And the movie is called "The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver Sol@@ d."
So how specifically will we see B@@ an in the film@@ ?
Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabin@@ et, you will see B@@ an de@@ od@@ or@@ ant.
While any@@ time I do an interview with someone, I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this intervie@@ w?
Are you ready? You look a little nerv@@ ous.
I want to help you calm down.
So maybe you should put some one before the intervie@@ w."
So we'll offer one of these fabulous s@@ cent@@ s.
Whether it's a "@@ Fl@@ oral F@@ us@@ ion@@ " or a "Par@@ ad@@ ise W@@ ind@@ s," they'll have their chance.
We will have them g@@ ear@@ ed for both male or female - sol@@ id, rol@@ l-@@ on or stic@@ k, whatever it may be.
That's the two-@@ cent tour@@ .
So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five-@@ cent tour@@ .
Kar@@ en Frank@@ : We are a smaller br@@ and.
Mu@@ ch like you talked about being a smaller movie, we're very much a challeng@@ er br@@ and.
So we don't have the bud@@ gets that other br@@ ands have.
So doing things like this - you know, remind people about B@@ an - is kind of why were interested in it.
MS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban@@ ?
B@@ an is bl@@ an@@ k.
K@@ F: That's a great question.
Woman: Su@@ peri@@ or technology.
MS: Technolog@@ y's not the way you want to describe something somebody's putting in their arm@@ p@@ it.
Man: We talk about bol@@ d, fres@@ h.
I think "@@ fresh@@ " is a great word that really sp@@ ins this category into the positive, versus "@@ figh@@ ts odor and wet@@ ness@@ ."
It keeps you fres@@ h.
How do we keep you fres@@ her longer - better fresh@@ ness, more fresh@@ ness, three times fres@@ her.
Things like that that are more of that positive benef@@ it.
MS: And that's a multi-@@ million dollar corpor@@ ation.
What about me? What about a regular gu@@ y?
I need to go talk to the man on the street, the people who are like me, the regular Jo@@ es.
They need to tell me about my br@@ and.
MS: How would you guys describe your brand@@ ?
Man: Um, my brand@@ ?
I don't know.
I like really nice cloth@@ es.
Woman: 80@@ 's re@@ viv@@ al meets sk@@ ater@@ -@@ pun@@ k, unless it's laund@@ ry day.
MS: All right, what is brand G@@ err@@ y?
G@@ err@@ y: Uni@@ que. Man: I guess what kind of gen@@ re, style I am would be like dark glam@@ or.
I like a lot of black colors, a lot of gr@@ ays and stuff like that.
But usually I have an access@@ or@@ y, like sun@@ glass@@ es, or I like cryst@@ al and things like that too.
Woman: If Dan were a br@@ and, he might be a classic conver@@ tible Mer@@ ced@@ es Ben@@ z.
Man 2: The brand that I am is, I would call it cas@@ ual fly.
Wo@@ man 2: Part hippi@@ e, part yo@@ gi@@ , part Brooklyn girl - I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the pet guy.
I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world.
So I guess that's my br@@ and.
In my war@@ ped little industry, that's my br@@ and.
Man 4: My brand is Fed@@ E@@ x because I deliver the good@@ s.
Man 5@@ : F@@ ai@@ led writ@@ er-@@ alcohol@@ ic br@@ and.
Is that some@@ thing?
L@@ aw@@ y@@ er: I'm a lawyer br@@ and.
Tom@@ : I'm T@@ om.
MS: Well we can't all be brand T@@ om, but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark gl@@ amor and cas@@ ual fly.
And what I realized is I needed an exper@@ t.
I needed somebody who could get inside my head, somebody who could really help me understand what they call your "@@ brand person@@ al@@ ity."
And so I found a company called Ol@@ son Z@@ al@@ t@@ man in Pitts@@ bur@@ g.
They've helped companies like N@@ est@@ le, Fe@@ bre@@ z@@ e, H@@ all@@ mark discover that brand personality.
If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me.
A@@ big@@ ail@@ : You brought your pictures, right?
MS: I did. The very first picture is a picture of my family.
A: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are.
MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world.
A: Tell me about this world.
MS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in - like people who are around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the job you do.
All those things s@@ tem@@ med and started from one place, and for me they s@@ tem@@ med and started with my family in West Virgin@@ ia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next one: This was the best day ever.
A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are?
MS: It's like, who do I want to be?
I like things that are different.
I like things that are weir@@ d. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about the "@@ wh@@ y" phase - what does that do for us?
What is the ma@@ che@@ te? What pup@@ a stage are you in now?
Why is it important to re@@ bo@@ ot@@ ? What does the red represent@@ ?
Tell me a little bit about that part.
... A little more about you that is not who you are.
What are some other me@@ tam@@ or@@ phos@@ es that you've had@@ ?
... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of rol@@ ler coas@@ ter are you on?
MS: EE@@ EE@@ EE@@ ! No, thank you.
A: Thanks for you pati@@ ence. A: Yeah. All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this.
There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there.
Lind@@ say Z@@ al@@ t@@ man: The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinc@@ t, but complement@@ ary sides to your brand personality - the M@@ organ S@@ pur@@ lock brand is a mind@@ ful@@ /@@ play br@@ and.
Those are ju@@ x@@ t@@ apos@@ ed very nic@@ ely together.
And I think there's almost a paradox with those.
And I think some companies will just focus on one of their streng@@ ths or the other instead of focusing on both.
Most companies tend to - and it's human nature - to avoid things that they're not sure of, avoid fear, those elem@@ ents, and you really embrace those, and you actually turn them into positiv@@ es for you, and it's a neat thing to see.
What other br@@ ands are like that?
The first on here is the class@@ ic, Ap@@ ple.
And you can see here too, Tar@@ get, Wi@@ i, Min@@ i from the Min@@ i Cooper@@ s, and J@@ et@@ Blu@@ e.
Now there's play@@ ful br@@ ands and mind@@ ful brand@@ s, those things that have come and gone, but a play@@ ful, mind@@ ful brand is a pretty powerful thing.
MS: A play@@ ful, mind@@ ful br@@ and. What is your brand@@ ?
If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand person@@ ality, what would you be?
Are you an up attribu@@ te? Are you something that gets the blood flow@@ ing?
Or are you more of a down attribu@@ te?
Are you something that's a little more cal@@ m, reser@@ ved, conserv@@ ati@@ ve?
Up attribu@@ tes are things like being play@@ ful, being fresh like the F@@ res@@ h Princ@@ e, contempor@@ ary, advent@@ ur@@ ous, ed@@ gy or dar@@ ing like Er@@ ro@@ l F@@ ly@@ n@@ n, n@@ im@@ ble or ag@@ i@@ le, prof@@ ane, domin@@ e@@ er@@ ing, magical or my@@ sti@@ cal like Gand@@ al@@ f.
Or are you more of a down attribu@@ te?
Are you mind@@ ful, sophisticated like 00@@ 7@@ ?
Are you establ@@ ished, tradition@@ al, nur@@ tur@@ ing, protec@@ tive, em@@ pa@@ thetic like the Opr@@ ah@@ ?
Are you reli@@ able, st@@ able, familiar, safe, sec@@ ure, sac@@ red, contempl@@ ative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Y@@ od@@ a?
Over the course of this film, we had 5@@ 00-@@ plus companies who were up and down companies saying, "@@ no@@ ," they didn't want any part of this project.
They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the final product.
But we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to rel@@ in@@ quis@@ h that control, who wanted to be in business with someone as mind@@ ful and as play@@ ful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn't be able to tell - stories that an adverti@@ ser would normally never get behind.
They enabled us to tell the story about neur@@ om@@ ar@@ ket@@ ing, as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using MR@@ I@@ 's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commerci@@ als as well as movie marketing.
We went to San Paul@@ o where they have ban@@ ned outdoor advertis@@ ing.
In the entire city for the past five years, there's no bill@@ boar@@ ds, there's no pos@@ ters, there's no fly@@ ers, nothing.
And we went to school distric@@ ts where now companies are making their way into cas@@ h-@@ str@@ apped schools all across America.
What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of, or I've had the most success in, are ones where I've interac@@ ted with things direc@@ tly.
And that's what these br@@ ands did.
They cut out the midd@@ le@@ man, they cut out their agencies and said, "@@ Maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to get people thinking, that's going to challenge the way we look at the world."
And how has that been for them? Has it been success@@ ful?
Well, since the film premi@@ ered at the Sund@@ ance Fil@@ m Festiv@@ al, let's take a look.
According to Bur@@ rel@@ les, the movie premi@@ ered in Jan@@ uary, and since then - and this isn't even the whole thing - we've had 900 million media impress@@ ions for this film.
That's literally covering just like a two and a half-@@ week period.
That's only online - no prin@@ t, no TV.
The film hasn't even been distributed yet.
It's not even online. It's not even stream@@ ing.
It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.
So ultimately, this film has already started to gain a lot of moment@@ um.
And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advis@@ ed their clients not to take part.
What I always believe is that if you take ch@@ ances, if you take ris@@ ks, that in those risks will come opportunity.
I believe that when you push people away from that, you're pushing them more towards failure.
I believe that when you train your employees to be risk aver@@ se, then you're preparing your whole company to be reward challeng@@ ed.
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take ris@@ ks.
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may s@@ care them.
Ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely, moving forward, I think we have to embrace fear.
We've got to put that bear in a ca@@ ge.
Em@@ br@@ ace fear. Em@@ br@@ ace risk.
One big spo@@ on@@ ful at a time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to embrace transpar@@ ency.
Today, more than ever, a little honest@@ y is going to go a long way.
And that being said, through honest@@ y and transparency, my entire talk, "E@@ m@@ br@@ ace Trans@@ par@@ enc@@ y," has been brought to you by my good friends at E@@ M@@ C, who for $@@ 7,@@ 100 bought the nam@@ ing rights on e@@ B@@ ay.
E@@ M@@ C: Tur@@ ning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world.
E@@ M@@ C present@@ s: "E@@ m@@ br@@ ace Trans@@ par@@ enc@@ y."
Thank you very much, guys.
June Coh@@ en: So, M@@ organ@@ , in the name of transparency, what exactly happened to that $@@ 7,@@ 100@@ ?
MS: That is a fantastic question.
I have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the TED organization, the Sa@@ pling Foundation - a check for $@@ 7,@@ 100 to be applied toward my attend@@ ance for next year's TED.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When first discovered in 2010, the Stu@@ x@@ net computer worm posed a b@@ af@@ fl@@ ing puzzle. B@@ ey@@ on@@ d its sophistica@@ tion loo@@ med a more trou@@ bling myster@@ y: its purpose. R@@ al@@ ph Lang@@ ner and team helped crack the code that revealed this digital war@@ head@@ 's final target. In a fascinating look inside cyber@@ -@@ for@@ ens@@ ics, he explains how - and makes a bold guess at its shocking origin@@ s.
R@@ al@@ ph Lang@@ ner@@ : C@@ rac@@ king Stu@@ x@@ net, a 21st-century cyber weap@@ on.
The idea behind the Stu@@ x@@ net computer worm is actually quite simple.
We don't want Iran to get the bomb@@ .
Their major as@@ set for developing nuclear weapons is the Nat@@ an@@ z ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment facil@@ ity.
The gray boxes that you see, these are real-time control systems.
Now if we manage to com@@ promise these systems that control drive spe@@ eds and val@@ ves, we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centr@@ i@@ fu@@ ge.
The gray boxes don't run Windo@@ ws softw@@ are@@ ; they are a completely different technology.
But if we manage to place a good Windo@@ ws virus on a note@@ book that is used by a maintenance engineer to con@@ figure this gray box, then we are in business.
And this is the plot behind Stu@@ x@@ net.
So we start with a Windo@@ ws drop@@ per.
The pay@@ load goes onto the gray box, dam@@ ages the centr@@ i@@ fu@@ ge, and the Iranian nuclear program is del@@ ayed - mission accompl@@ ished.
That's easy, hu@@ h?
I want to tell you how we found that out.
When we started our research on Stu@@ x@@ net six months ago, it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.
The only thing that was known is it's very, very complex on the Windo@@ ws part, the drop@@ per part, used multiple zero-@@ day vulner@@ abilities.
And it seemed to want to do something with these gray box@@ es, these real-time control systems.
So that got our attention, and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stu@@ x@@ net and checked this thing out.
And then some very funny things happened.
Stu@@ x@@ net behav@@ ed like a lab rat that didn't like our cheese - sni@@ ff@@ ed, but didn't want to eat.
Did@@ n't make sense to me.
And after we experim@@ ented with different flav@@ ors of che@@ ese, I realized, well, this is a direc@@ ted attack.
It's completely direc@@ ted.
The drop@@ per is pro@@ w@@ ling actively on the gray box if a specific configur@@ ation is found, and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infec@@ t is actually running on that target.
And if not, Stu@@ x@@ net does nothing.
So that really got my attention, and we started to work on this nearly around the clock, because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.
It could be, let's say for example, a U.S. power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
So we better find out what the target is soon@@ ."
So we extrac@@ ted and de@@ comp@@ iled the attack code, and we discovered that it's struc@@ tured in two digital bombs - a smaller one and a bigger one.
And we also saw that they are very profession@@ ally engineered by people who obviously had all ins@@ ider information.
They knew all the bits and bi@@ tes that they had to attack.
They probably even know the sho@@ e size of the oper@@ ator.
So they know everything.
And if you have heard that the drop@@ per of Stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech, let me tell you this: the pay@@ load is rocket science.
It's way above everything that we have ever seen before.
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.
We are talking about - around about 15,000 lines of code.
Loo@@ ks pretty much like old-@@ style assembly language.
And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code.
So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function call@@ s, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for ti@@ mers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world - to potential real world target@@ s.
So we do need target theories that we can prove or dis@@ pro@@ ve.
In order to get target the@@ ori@@ es, we remember that it's definitely hard@@ core sab@@ ot@@ age, it must be a high-@@ value target and it is most likely located in Iran, because that's where most of the infec@@ tions had been repor@@ ted.
Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically bo@@ ils down to the Bus@@ he@@ h@@ r nuclear power plant and to the Nat@@ an@@ z fuel en@@ rich@@ ment plant.
So I told my assist@@ ant, "G@@ et me a list of all centr@@ i@@ fu@@ ge and power plant experts from our client base@@ ."
And I phon@@ ed them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data.
And that worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the small digital war@@ head with the ro@@ tor control.
The ro@@ tor is that moving part within the centr@@ i@@ fu@@ ge, that black object that you see.
And if you manipulate the speed of this ro@@ tor, you are actually able to crack the ro@@ tor and eventually even have the centr@@ i@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creep@@ y - obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy, that they would not be able to figure this out quickly.
The big digital war@@ head - we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures.
So for example, the number 16@@ 4 really stands out in that co@@ de@@ ; you can't over@@ look it.
I started to research scientific literature on how these centr@@ i@@ fu@@ ges are actually built in Nat@@ an@@ z and found they are struc@@ tured in what is called a cas@@ cad@@ e, and each cas@@ ca@@ de holds 16@@ 4 centr@@ i@@ fug@@ es.
So that made sense, that was a mat@@ ch.
And it even got better.
These centr@@ i@@ fu@@ ges in Iran are sub@@ divided into 15, what is called, st@@ ages.
And guess what we found in the attack co@@ de?
An almost identical structure.
So again, that was a real good mat@@ ch.
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.
Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.
These results have been obtain@@ ed over several weeks of really hard labor.
And we often went into just a dead end and had to recover@@ .
Anyway, so we figured out that both digital war@@ heads were actually aim@@ ing at one and the same tar@@ get, but from different ang@@ les.
The small war@@ head is taking one cas@@ cad@@ e, and spinning up the ro@@ tors and slowing them down, and the big war@@ head is talking to six cas@@ cad@@ es and manipul@@ ating val@@ ves.
So in all, we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is.
It is Nat@@ an@@ z, and it is only Nat@@ an@@ z.
So we don't have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stu@@ x@@ net.
Here's some very cool stuff that we saw - really knocked my soc@@ ks off.
D@@ own there is the gray box, and on the top you see the centr@@ i@@ fug@@ es.
Now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the input values from sensors - so for example, from pressure sensors and vibr@@ ation sensors - and it provides legitimate program code, which is still running during the attack, with fake input data.
And as a matter of fact, this fake input data is actually pr@@ ere@@ cor@@ ded by Stu@@ x@@ net.
So it's just like from the Hollywood movies where during the he@@ ist, the observation camera is fed with pr@@ ere@@ cor@@ ded video.
That's cool, hu@@ h?
The idea here is obviously not only to fo@@ ol the oper@@ ators in the control room.
It actually is much more dangerous and aggress@@ ive.
The idea is to circum@@ v@@ ent a digital safety system.
We need digital safety systems where a human oper@@ ator could not act quick enough.
So for example, in a power plant, when your big steam turb@@ ine gets too over speed, you must open relief val@@ ves within a millisecon@@ d.
Obviously, this cannot be done by a human oper@@ ator.
So this is where we need digital safety systems.
And when they are compromis@@ ed, then real bad things can happen.
Your plant can blow up.
And neither your oper@@ ators nor your safety system will notice it.
That's scar@@ y.
But it gets worse.
And this is very important, what I'm going to say.
Think about this: this attack is gener@@ ic.
It doesn't have anything to do, in specific@@ s, with centr@@ i@@ fug@@ es, with ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment.
So it would work as well, for example, in a power plant or in an automobile factor@@ y.
It is gener@@ ic.
And you don't have - as an attack@@ er - you don't have to deliver this pay@@ load by a US@@ B stic@@ k, as we saw it in the case of Stu@@ x@@ net.
You could also use conventional worm technology for spread@@ ing.
Just spread it as wide as possible.
And if you do that, what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruc@@ tion.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
So unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East.
They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.
So all of the green areas, these are your target@@ -@@ rich environments.
We have to face the consequ@@ ences, and we better start to prepare right now.
Thanks.
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.
R@@ alph@@ , it's been quite widely reported that people assume that Mos@@ sad is the main enti@@ ty behind this.
Is that your opin@@ ion@@ ?
R@@ al@@ ph Lang@@ ner@@ : Okay, you really want to hear that?
Yeah. Okay.
My opinion is that the Mos@@ sad is involved, but that the leading force is not Israel.
So the leading force behind that is the cyber super@@ power.
There is only one, and that's the United States - fortunately, fortun@@ ately.
Because other@@ wise, our problems would even be bigger.
CA: Thank you for scar@@ ing the living day@@ lights out of us. Thank you, R@@ alph@@ .
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: E@@ y@@ th@@ or B@@ ender of Berkeley Bion@@ ics brings on@@ stage two amazing ex@@ os@@ k@@ elet@@ ons, H@@ U@@ L@@ C and e@@ LE@@ G@@ S - robotic ad@@ d-@@ ons that could one day allow a human to carry 200 pounds without tir@@ ing, or allow a wheelchair user to stand and walk. It's a powerful on@@ stage dem@@ o, with implications for human potential of all kin@@ ds.
E@@ y@@ th@@ or B@@ end@@ er: Human ex@@ os@@ k@@ elet@@ ons - for war and heal@@ ing.
I want you now to imagine a wear@@ able robot that gives you super@@ human abil@@ ities, or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again.
We at Berkeley Bion@@ ics call these robots ex@@ os@@ k@@ elet@@ ons.
These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning, and it will give you extra streng@@ th, and it will further enhance your speed, and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.
It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that - it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there.
This is just not some blue sky thinking.
To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldi@@ er, that on average does carry about 100 l@@ bs. on their back@@ s, and they are being asked to carry more equipment.
Obviously, this is resul@@ ting in some major complic@@ ations - back inju@@ ri@@ es, 30 percent of them - chronic back inju@@ ri@@ es.
So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an ex@@ os@@ k@@ elet@@ on that would help deal with this issue.
So let me now introduce to you H@@ U@@ L@@ C - or the Human Univers@@ al Lo@@ ad Car@@ ri@@ er.
Sol@@ di@@ er: With the H@@ U@@ L@@ C ex@@ os@@ k@@ elet@@ on, I can carry 200 l@@ bs. over vari@@ ed ter@@ rain for many hours.
Its flexible design allows for deep squ@@ ats, craw@@ ls and high-@@ ag@@ il@@ ity movem@@ ents.
It senses what I want to do, where I want to go, and then aug@@ ments my strength and endur@@ ance.
E@@ y@@ th@@ or B@@ end@@ er: We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device, this new ex@@ os@@ k@@ elet@@ on this year.
So this is for real.
Now let's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users, something that I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 6@@ 8 million people estimated to be in wheel@@ chairs worldwide.
This is about one percent of the total population.
And that's actually a conservative estima@@ te.
We are talking here about, of@@ t@@ enti@@ mes, very young individuals with spinal cord inju@@ ri@@ es, that in the prime of their life - 20@@ s, 30@@ s, 40@@ s - hit a wall and the wheel@@ chair@@ 's the only option.
But it is also the aging population that is multi@@ pl@@ ying in numbers.
And the only op@@ tion, pretty much - when it's stroke or other complic@@ ations - is the wheel@@ chair.
And that is actually for the last 500 years, since its very successful introduc@@ tion, I must say.
So we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobil@@ ity.
Let me now introduce you to e@@ LE@@ G@@ S that is wor@@ n by Amanda B@@ ox@@ tel that 19 years ago was spinal cord inj@@ ured, and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now.
Amanda B@@ ox@@ tel@@ : Thank you.
E@@ B: Amanda is wearing our e@@ LE@@ G@@ S set.
It has sensor@@ s.
It's completely non-@@ invas@@ ive, sensors in the crut@@ ches that send signals back to our on@@ board computer that is sitting here at her back.
There are battery pac@@ ks here as well that power mo@@ tors that are sitting at her hi@@ ps, as well as her knee join@@ ts, that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural ga@@ it.
AB: I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a fre@@ ak sum@@ mer@@ sa@@ ul@@ t while down@@ hill ski@@ ing paralyzed me.
In a split second, I lost all sensation and movement below my pel@@ v@@ is.
Not long afterwards, a doctor stro@@ de into my hospital room, and he said, "A@@ mand@@ a, you'll never walk again."
And that was 19 ye@@ as ago.
He rob@@ bed every ounce of hope from my being.
Ad@@ ap@@ tive technology has since enabled me to learn how to down@@ hill ski again, to rock climb and even hand@@ cycle.
But nothing has been invented that enables me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
E@@ B: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations - not only for the soldi@@ ers, or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users, but for everyone.
AB: Thanks.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: With never@@ -@@ befor@@ e-@@ seen video, primat@@ ologist Isab@@ el Be@@ hn@@ c@@ ke I@@ z@@ qui@@ er@@ do shows how bonob@@ o ape society learns from constantly playing - solo, with friends, even as a pre@@ lu@@ de to sex. Indeed, play appears to be the bonob@@ os@@ ' key to problem@@ -@@ solving and avoid@@ ing conflict. If it works for our close cous@@ ins, why not for us?
Isab@@ el Be@@ hn@@ c@@ ke@@ : Evolu@@ tion@@ 's gift of play, from bonob@@ o ap@@ es to humans.
I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women run the show, have sex to say hell@@ o, and play rules the day - where fun is serious business.
And no, this isn't Bur@@ ning Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cous@@ ins.
This is the world of wild bonob@@ os in the jung@@ les of Congo.
Bon@@ ob@@ os are, together with chimpanze@@ es, your living closest rel@@ ative.
That means we all share a common ancest@@ or, an evolutionary grand@@ mother, who lived around six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are well-known for their aggress@@ ion.
But unfortunately, we have made too much of an emphas@@ is of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But bonob@@ os show us the other side of the co@@ in.
While chimpanzees are dominated by big, scary guys, bonob@@ o society is run by empowered femal@@ es.
These guys have really worked something out, since this leads to a highly toler@@ ant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet.
But unfortunately, bonob@@ os are the least understood of the great ap@@ es.
They live in the dep@@ ths of the Con@@ gol@@ ese jung@@ le, and it has been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradox - a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of darkness itself - the scene of a violent conflict that has r@@ aged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War.
Not surprisingly, this destruction also endang@@ ers bonob@@ o survival.
Bus@@ h@@ meat tr@@ ades and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadi@@ um with all the bonob@@ os that are left in the world - and we're not even sure of that to be hon@@ est.
Yet, in this land of violence and cha@@ os, you can hear hidden laughter swa@@ ying the trees.
Who are these cous@@ ins@@ ?
We know them as the "@@ make love, not war@@ " ap@@ es since they have frequ@@ ent, promis@@ cu@@ ous and bis@@ exual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues.
Now, I'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanit@@ y's problems - since there's more to bonob@@ o life than the K@@ ama Su@@ tr@@ a.
Bon@@ ob@@ os, like humans, love to play throughout their entire lives.
Pl@@ ay is not just child's games.
For us and them, play is found@@ ational for bon@@ ding relationships and fos@@ tering toler@@ ance.
It's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game.
Pl@@ ay increases creativity and resili@@ ence, and it's all about the generation of diversity - diversity of interac@@ tions, diversity of behavi@@ ors, diversity of connec@@ tions.
And when you watch bonob@@ o play, you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laugh@@ ter, dance and ritu@@ al.
Pl@@ ay is the glu@@ e that bin@@ ds us together.
Now, I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild.
First, it's a ball game bon@@ o@@ bo-@@ style - and I do not mean foot@@ ball.
So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game.
Have a look what she's doing.
It might be the evolutionary origin of the phras@@ e, "@@ she's got him by the ball@@ s."
Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right?
Yeah.
So sex play is common in both bonob@@ os and humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows - this vide@@ o's really interesting because it shows the inv@@ enti@@ ven@@ ess of bringing unusual elements into play - such as tes@@ tic@@ les - and also how play both requires trust and fos@@ ters trust - while at the same time being tremendous fun.
But play@@ 's a shap@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter.
Play@@ 's a shap@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter, and it can take many forms, some of which are more qui@@ et, imagin@@ ative, curious - maybe where wonder is discovered ane@@ w.
And I want you to see, this is Fu@@ k@@ u, a young femal@@ e, and she is quiet@@ ly playing with water.
I think, like her, we sometimes play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer world@@ s.
And it's that play@@ ful curiosity that drives us to explor@@ e, drives us to interac@@ t, and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hot@@ bed for creativity.
So these are just small tas@@ ters into the insights that bonob@@ o give us to our past and present.
But they also hold a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooper@@ ation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capac@@ ities.
In other words, play is our adap@@ tive wild@@ card.
In order to adapt successfully to a changing world, we need to play.
But will we make the most of our play@@ ful@@ ness@@ ?
Pl@@ ay is not fri@@ vol@@ ous.
Play@@ 's essenti@@ al.
For bonob@@ os and humans ali@@ ke, life is not just red in tooth and cla@@ w.
In times when it seems least appropriate to play, it might be the times when it is most urg@@ ent.
And so, my fellow primat@@ es, let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together, as we re@@ discover creativity, fel@@ low@@ ship and won@@ der.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er firef@@ igh@@ ter Mark Be@@ z@@ os tells a story of an act of hero@@ ism that didn't go quite as expected - but that taught him a big less@@ on: Don't wait to be a hero.
Mark Be@@ z@@ os: A life lesson from a volunteer firef@@ igh@@ ter.
Back in New York, I am the head of development for a non-@@ profit called Robin Ho@@ od.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assist@@ ant cap@@ tain of a volunteer fire company.
Now in our town, where the volunteers supple@@ ment a highly skilled career staf@@ f, you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the scen@@ e, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.
But still it was a real foo@@ trace against the other volunteers to get to the cap@@ tain in charge to find out what our assign@@ ments would be.
When I found the cap@@ tain@@ , he was having a very engaging conversation with the home@@ own@@ er, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
Here it was, the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the pouring rain, under an umb@@ rel@@ la, in her pa@@ jam@@ as, bar@@ e@@ foot, while her house was in flam@@ es.
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me - let's call him Le@@ x Luther - got to the cap@@ tain first and was asked to go inside and save the home@@ own@@ er's dog.
The dog@@ ! I was stun@@ ned with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y.
Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living cre@@ ature, just because he beat me by five seconds.
Well, I was next.
The cap@@ tain wav@@ ed me over.
He said, "@@ Be@@ z@@ os, I need you to go into the house.
I need you to go up@@ stair@@ s, past the fire, and I need you to get this woman a pair of sho@@ es."
I swe@@ ar.
So, not exactly what I was hoping for, but off I went - up the stair@@ s, down the h@@ all, past the '@@ real@@ ' firef@@ igh@@ ters, who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point, into the master bedro@@ om to get a pair of shoes.
Now I know what you're thinking, but I'm no hero.
I carried my pay@@ load back down@@ stairs where I met my n@@ em@@ esis and the precious dog by the front door.
We took our treas@@ ures outside to the home@@ own@@ er, where, not surprisingly, his received much more attention than did mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the home@@ owner than@@ king us for the vali@@ ant effort dis@@ played in saving her home.
The act of kindness she no@@ ted above all other@@ s: someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes.
In both my voc@@ ation at Robin Ho@@ od and my av@@ oc@@ ation as a volunteer firef@@ igh@@ ter, I am witness to acts of generos@@ ity and kindness on a monument@@ al scale, but I'm also witness to acts of gr@@ ace and courage on an individual basis.
And you know what I've lear@@ ne@@ d?
They all matter.
So as I look around this room at people who either have achie@@ ved, or are on their way to achiev@@ ing, remarkable levels of success, I would offer this remin@@ der@@ : don't wait.
Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to gi@@ ve, give it now.
Ser@@ ve food at a soup kitch@@ en. C@@ lean up a neighborhood park.
Be a ment@@ or.
Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.
So get in the game. S@@ ave the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mar@@ k, Mar@@ k, come back.
Mark Be@@ z@@ os: Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Imagine a set of electronics as easy to play with as Leg@@ os. TED Fellow Ay@@ ah B@@ de@@ ir introduc@@ es lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its, a set of simple, inter@@ chan@@ ge@@ able blocks that make programming as simple and important a part of creativity as sn@@ apping blocks together.
Ay@@ ah B@@ de@@ ir@@ : Building blocks that blin@@ k, be@@ ep and teach@@ .
This may sound strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete bloc@@ k.
The first concrete blocks were manufac@@ tured in 186@@ 8 with a very simple idea: modul@@ es made of c@@ ement of a fixed measure@@ ment that fit together.
Very quickly concrete blocks became the mos@@ t-@@ used construction unit in the world.
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us, buildings, brid@@ ges, one br@@ ick at a time.
Es@@ senti@@ ally concrete blocks had become the building block of our time.
Almost a hundred years later in 194@@ 7, LE@@ G@@ O came up with this.
It was called the Au@@ toma@@ tic B@@ inding B@@ ric@@ k.
And in a few short years, LE@@ G@@ O br@@ icks took place in every house@@ hold.
It's estimated that over 400 billion br@@ icks have been produced - or 75 br@@ icks for every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses, beautiful brid@@ ges, beautiful buildings.
LE@@ G@@ O made it access@@ ible.
LE@@ G@@ O has essentially taken the concrete bloc@@ k, the building block of the world, and made it into the building block of our imagination.
Mean@@ while the exact same year, at Bell Lab@@ s the next revolution was about to be announc@@ ed, the next building bloc@@ k.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static br@@ icks pi@@ led on top of each other to a world where everything was interac@@ tive.
Like the concrete bloc@@ k, the transistor allows you to build much larger, more complex circu@@ its, one br@@ ick at a time.
But there's a main differ@@ ence: The transistor was only for exper@@ ts.
I personally don't accept this, that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for exper@@ ts, so I decided to change that.
E@@ ight years ago when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started developing lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its.
Let me show you how they work.
L@@ it@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its are electronic modul@@ es with each one specific function.
They're pre-@@ engineered to be light, sound, mo@@ tors and sensor@@ s.
And the best part about it is they sn@@ ap together with magne@@ ts.
So you can't put them the wrong way.
The br@@ icks are color@@ -@@ co@@ ded.
Green is output@@ , blue is power, pink is input and orange is wi@@ re.
So all you need to do is sn@@ ap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circu@@ its.
You put a blue to a green, you can make light.
You can put a kno@@ b in between and now you've made a little dim@@ mer.
Swit@@ ch out the kno@@ b for a pulse mod@@ u@@ le, which is here, and now you've made a little bl@@ ink@@ er.
Ad@@ d this bu@@ zz@@ er for some extra punch and you've created a noise machine.
I'm going to stop that.
So beyond simple play, lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its are actually pretty powerful.
Instead of having to program, to wi@@ re, to sol@@ der, lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its allow you to program using very simple intuitive gest@@ ures.
So to make this bl@@ ink faster or slow@@ er, you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pulse faster or slow@@ er.
The idea behind lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its is that it's a growing libr@@ ary.
We want to make every single interaction in the world into a read@@ y-@@ to-@@ use br@@ ick.
L@@ igh@@ ts, sounds, solar pan@@ els, mo@@ tors - everything should be access@@ ible.
We've been giving lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its to kids and seeing them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The nic@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at schools.
For example, how a night@@ light works, or why an elev@@ ator door stays open, or how an iPod respon@@ ds to touch.
We've also been taking lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its to design schools.
So for example, we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatso@@ ever start to play with lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its as a material.
Here you see, with felt and paper water bott@@ les, we have Geor@@ die making ...
A few weeks ago we took lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its to RIS@@ D and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatso@@ ever - just card@@ board, wood and paper - and told them "M@@ ake some@@ thing."
Here's an example of a project they made, a mo@@ tion-@@ activated conf@@ etti can@@ on ball.
But wait, this is actually my favorite project.
It's a lob@@ ster made of play@@ dough that's afraid of the dark.
To these non-@@ engineers, lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its became another material, electronics became just another material.
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.
So lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its is open-@@ source.
You can go on the website, download all the design fil@@ es, make them yourself.
We want to encourage a world of cre@@ ators, of invent@@ ors, of contribut@@ ors, because this world that we live in, this interactive world, is our@@ s.
So go ahead and start invent@@ ing.
Thank you.

TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Can government be run like the Internet, per@@ mission@@ less and open@@ ? C@@ od@@ er and activist Jennifer P@@ ah@@ l@@ ka believes it can - and that ap@@ ps, built quickly and che@@ apl@@ y, are a powerful new way to connect citizens to their governments - and their neighbor@@ s.
Jennifer P@@ ah@@ l@@ k@@ a: C@@ od@@ ing a better government.
So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rock@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to h@@ ate@@ ; we have them work in government.
The program is called Co@@ de for America, and it's a little bit like a Peace Cor@@ ps for gee@@ ks.
We select a few fel@@ lows every year and we have them work with city govern@@ ments.
Instead of sending them off into the Third Worl@@ d, we send them into the wil@@ ds of City H@@ all.
And there they make great ap@@ ps, they work with city staf@@ fer@@ s.
But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today.
So meet Al@@ .
Al is a fire hydr@@ ant in the city of Boston.
Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date, but what he's really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ no@@ wed in, because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires when he's covered in four feet of s@@ now.
Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner@@ ?
We had a team of fel@@ lows in Boston last year through the Co@@ de for America program.
They were there in Febr@@ uary, and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot in February last year.
And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydr@@ ants.
But one fellow in particular, a guy named Erik Micha@@ el@@ s-@@ Ob@@ er, noticed something else, and that's that citizens are sho@@ vel@@ ing out side@@ walks right in front of these things.
So he did what any good develop@@ er would do, he wrote an ap@@ p.
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydr@@ ant.
So you agree to dig it out when it snow@@ s.
If you do, you get to name it, and he called the first one Al@@ .
And if you don't, someone can steal it from you.
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it.
This is a modest little ap@@ p.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fel@@ lows wrote last year.
But it's doing something that no other government technology does.
It's spreading vir@@ ally.
There's a guy in the I.@@ T. department of the City of Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this app and realized that he could use it, not for snow, but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sir@@ ens.
It's very important that these tsunami sir@@ ens work, but people steal the batteri@@ es out of them.
So he's getting citizens to check on them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out c@@ log@@ ged storm dr@@ ain@@ s.
And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel side@@ walks when it snow@@ s.
So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this.
And this has spread just fric@@ tion@@ less@@ ly, organ@@ ically, natur@@ ally.
If you know anything about government technology, you know that this isn't how it normally goes.
Proc@@ ur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years.
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months.
It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids.
We were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal channel@@ s, it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
There is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost tax@@ pay@@ ers two billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads vir@@ ally, that's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government.
It suggests how government could work better - not more like a private company, as many people think it shoul@@ d.
And not even like a tech company, but more like the Internet itself.
And that means per@@ mission@@ less, it means open, it means gener@@ ative.
And that's important.
But what's more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tack@@ ling the problem of government - not as the problem of an os@@ si@@ fied institu@@ tion, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's great news, because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action with digital technology.
Now there's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effec@@ tively.
It's not just Co@@ de for America fel@@ low@@ s, there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up on government.
They are frustrated as hell with it, but they're not complain@@ ing about it, they're fixing it.
And these folks know something that we've lost sight of.
And that's that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DM@@ V and all those other things that we're really mad about, government is, at its co@@ re, in the words of Tim O'@@ Re@@ ill@@ y, "What we do together that we can't do al@@ one."
Now a lot of people have given up on government.
And if you're one of those people, I would ask that you re@@ consid@@ er, because things are changing.
Pol@@ i@@ tics is not chang@@ ing; government is changing.
And because government ultimately deriv@@ es its power from us - remember "We the people@@ ?" - how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens.
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.
And like a lot of people, I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.
Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion that, especially local government, is about o@@ poss@@ um@@ s.
This is the call center for the services and information line.
It's generally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city.
If you should ever have the chance to staff your cit@@ y's call center, as our fellow Scott Sil@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program - in fact, they all do that - you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues, including having an o@@ poss@@ um stuck in your house.
So Scott gets this call.
He types "O@@ poss@@ um@@ " into this official knowledge base.
He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control.
And finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leav@@ es?"
So that worked. So boo@@ ya for Scot@@ t.
But that wasn't the end of the o@@ poss@@ um@@ s.
Boston doesn't just have a call center.
It has an ap@@ p, a Web and mobile ap@@ p, called C@@ iti@@ z@@ ens Connec@@ t.
Now we didn't write this ap@@ p.
This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Ur@@ ban Me@@ chan@@ ics in Boston.
So one day - this is an actual report - this came in: "O@@ poss@@ um in my tr@@ ash@@ can. Can@@ 't tell if it's dead.
How do I get this remo@@ ve@@ d@@ ?"
But what happens with C@@ iti@@ z@@ ens Connec@@ t is different.
So Scott was speaking person@@ -to-@@ person.
But on C@@ iti@@ z@@ ens Connec@@ t everything is public, so everybody can see this.
And in this case, a neighbor saw it.
And the next report we got said, "I walked over to this loc@@ ation, found the tr@@ ash@@ can behind the house.
O@@ poss@@ um@@ ? Ch@@ ec@@ k. Liv@@ ing? Y@@ ep.
Tur@@ ned tr@@ ash@@ can on its side. Wal@@ ked home.
Good@@ night sweet o@@ poss@@ um@@ ."
Pretty simple.
So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physic@@ al.
And it's also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d-@@ sourcing game.
But it's also a great example of government as a plat@@ form.
And I don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here.
I'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others.
So one citizen helped another citiz@@ en, but government played a key role here.
It connected those two people.
And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been nee@@ ded, but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services.
When one neighbor helps another, we streng@@ then our communities.
We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.
Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics.
And most people get that, but they think that one is the input to the other.
That our input to the system of government is vo@@ ting.
Now how many times have we elected a political leader - and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected - and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs, and then not that much chang@@ es?
That's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-@@ inch layer on top.
And what's under that is what we call bureau@@ crac@@ y.
And we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t.
But it's that con@@ temp@@ t that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that's working against us, this other thing, and then we're dis@@ empowering ourselves.
People seem to think politics is sex@@ y.
If we want this institution to work for us, we're going to have to make bureaucr@@ acy sex@@ y.
Because that's where the real work of government happens.
We have to engage with the machinery of government.
So that's Oc@@ cup@@ y@@ the@@ SE@@ C movement has done.
Have you seen these gu@@ ys@@ ?
It's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report that's a response to the SE@@ C@@ 's request for comment on the Fin@@ ancial Re@@ form B@@ ill.
That's not being politically active, that's being bureaucr@@ atic@@ ally active.
Now for those of us who've given up on government, it's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they're going to face.
Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us?
We can't do without government, but we do need it to be more effective.
The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by streng@@ th@@ ening civil society.
And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet, and they know that it's not that hard to do things together, you just have to architect the systems the right way.
Now the average age of our fel@@ lows is 2@@ 8, so I am, be@@ grud@@ g@@ ingly, almost a generation older than most of them.
This is a generation that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for gran@@ ted.
They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting about who gets to speak@@ ; they all get to speak.
They can express their opinion on any channel at any time, and they do.
So when they're faced with the problem of government, they don't care as much about using their vo@@ ices.
They're using their hands.
They're using their hands to write applications that make government work better.
And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better.
That could be sho@@ vel@@ ing out a hydr@@ ant, pulling a we@@ ed, turning over a garbage can with an o@@ poss@@ um in it.
And certain@@ ly, we could have been sho@@ vel@@ ing out those fire hydr@@ ants all along, and many people do.
But these apps are like little digital remin@@ ders that we're not just consum@@ ers, and we're not just consumers of government, putting in our taxes and getting back services.
We're more than that, we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix government until we fix citizen@@ ship.
So the question I have for all of you here: When it comes to the big, important things that we need to do together, all of us together, are we just going to be a crowd of voices, or are we also going to be a crowd of hand@@ s?
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In an engaging and personal talk - with cam@@ e@@ o appear@@ ances from his grandmother and R@@ osa Par@@ ks - human rights lawyer Br@@ y@@ an Steven@@ son shares some hard truths about America's justice system, starting with a massive im@@ balance along racial lin@@ es: a third of the country's black male population has been incarcer@@ ated at some point in their lives. These issues, which are wrapped up in America's un@@ examin@@ ed history, are rarely talked about with this level of cand@@ or, insight and persu@@ asi@@ ven@@ ess.
Br@@ y@@ an Steven@@ son: We need to talk about an in@@ justice.
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me.
I spend most of my time in jail@@ s, in pris@@ ons, on death row.
I spend most of my time in very low-@@ income communities in the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopel@@ ess@@ ness.
And being here at TED and seeing the stimul@@ ation, hearing it, has been very, very energ@@ izing to me.
And one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that TED has an identity.
And you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world.
And sometimes when it comes through TED, it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it does@@ n't.
And I mention that because I think identity is really important.
And we've had some fantastic present@@ ations.
And I think what we've learned is that, if you're a teacher your words can be meaning@@ ful, but if you're a compassionate teacher, they can be especially meaning@@ ful.
If you're a doctor you can do some good things, but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things.
And so I want to talk about the power of identity.
And I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do.
I actually learned about this from my grand@@ mother.
I grew up in a house that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matri@@ ar@@ ch, and that matri@@ ar@@ ch was my grand@@ mother.
She was tough@@ , she was strong, she was powerful.
She was the end of every argument in our family.
She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family.
She was the daughter of people who were actually ens@@ lav@@ ed.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virgin@@ ia in the 18@@ 40@@ 's.
She was born in the 18@@ 80@@ 's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world.
And my grandmother was tough@@ , but she was also lo@@ ving.
When I would see her as a little boy, she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hu@@ gs.
And she'd squee@@ ze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go.
And an hour or two later, if I saw her, she'd come over to me and she'd say, "@@ Br@@ y@@ an, do you still feel me hug@@ ging you?"
And if I said, "No@@ ," she'd assaul@@ t me again, and if I said, "Y@@ es," she'd leave me alone.
And she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her.
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children.
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.
And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her, it would be difficult to get her time and attention.
My cous@@ ins would be running around everywhere.
And I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old, wa@@ king up one morning, going into the living room, and all of my cous@@ ins were running around.
And my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me.
And at first I thought we were playing a game.
And I would look at her and I'd smile, but she was very serious.
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this, she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said, "Come on, Br@@ y@@ an. You and I are going to have a tal@@ k."
And I remember this just like it happened yester@@ day.
I never will forget it.
She took me out back and she said, "@@ Br@@ y@@ an, I'm going to tell you something, but you don't tell anybody what I tell you."
I said, "Okay, Mam@@ a."
She said, "@@ Now you make sure you don't do that." I said, "S@@ ure@@ ."
Then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said, "I want you to know I've been watching you."
And she said, "I think you're speci@@ al."
She said, "I think you can do anything you want to do."
I will never forget it.
And then she said, "I just need you to promise me three things, Br@@ y@@ an."
I said, "Okay, Mam@@ a."
She said, "The first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mo@@ m."
She said, "That's my baby girl, and you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her@@ ."
Well I ador@@ ed my mom, so I said, "Yes, M@@ ama. I'll do that."
Then she said, "The second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing."
And I thought about it and I said, "Yes, M@@ ama. I'll do that."
Then finally she said, "The third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol@@ ."
Well I was nine years old, so I said, "Yes, M@@ ama. I'll do that."
I grew up in the country in the rural Sou@@ th, and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year youn@@ ger.
When I was about 14 or 15, one day my brother came home and he had this six-@@ pack of beer - I don't know where he got it - and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the wo@@ ods.
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we craz@@ ily did.
And he had a si@@ p of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some, and they offered it to me.
I said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any be@@ er."
My brother said, "Come on. We're doing this today@@ ; you always do what we do.
I had some, your sister had some@@ . Have some be@@ er."
I said, "No, I don't feel right about that. Y@@ '@@ all go ahead. Y@@ '@@ all go a@@ head@@ ."
And then my brother started staring at me.
He said, "What's wrong with you? Have some be@@ er."
Then he looked at me real hard and he said, "Oh, I hope you're not still hun@@ g up on that conversation M@@ ama had with you."
I said, "Well, what are you talking about@@ ?"
He said, "Oh, M@@ ama tells all the grand@@ kids that they're speci@@ al."
I was devas@@ ta@@ ted.
And I'm going to admit something to you.
I'm going to tell you something I probably shoul@@ d@@ n't.
I know this might be broadcast broad@@ ly.
But I'm 52 years old, and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol@@ .
I don't say that because I think that's virtu@@ ous@@ ; I say that because there is power in identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe makes sense.
We can get them to do things that they don't think they can do.
When I thought about my grand@@ mother, of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special.
My grandfather was in prison during prohi@@ bi@@ tion.
My male un@@ cles died of alcohol@@ -@@ related diseases.
And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to.
Well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In 197@@ 2, there were 3@@ 00,000 people in jail@@ s and pris@@ ons.
Today, there are 2.@@ 3 million.
The United States now has the highest rate of incarcer@@ ation in the world.
We have seven million people on prob@@ ation and par@@ o@@ le.
And mass incarcer@@ ation, in my judg@@ ment, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, in communities of color there is this despa@@ ir, there is this hopel@@ ess@@ ness, that is being shaped by these outcomes.
One out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail@@ , in prison, on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le.
In urban communities across this country - Los Angeles, Philadelph@@ ia, Balti@@ more, Washington - 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on prob@@ ation or par@@ o@@ le.
Our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distor@@ ting around race, they're also distor@@ ted by poverty.
We have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innoc@@ ent.
We@@ al@@ th, not culp@@ ability, shapes outcomes.
And yet, we seem to be very comfort@@ able.
The politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems.
We've been dis@@ connected.
It's interesting to me.
We're looking at some very interesting develop@@ ments in our work.
My state of Alab@@ ama, like a number of states, actually perman@@ ently dis@@ enfr@@ anch@@ is@@ es you if you have a criminal convic@@ tion.
Right now in Alab@@ ama 34 percent of the black male population has perman@@ ently lost the right to vote.
We're actually projec@@ ting in another 10 years the level of dis@@ enfr@@ anch@@ is@@ ement will be as high as it's been since prior to the pass@@ age of the Vo@@ ting Rights Ac@@ t.
And there is this stunning silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13@@ -year-old children to die in prison.
We have life imprison@@ ment without par@@ ole for kids in this country.
And we're actually doing some li@@ tig@@ ation.
The only country in the world.
I represent people on death row.
It's interesting, this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty.
In many ways, we've been taught to think that the real question is, do people deserve to die for the crimes they've commit@@ ted?
And that's a very sensi@@ ble question.
But there's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity.
The other way of thinking about it is not, do people deserve to die for the crimes they comm@@ it, but do we deserve to kill@@ ?
I mean, it's fascinating.
De@@ ath penalty in America is defined by err@@ or.
For every nine people who have been execu@@ ted, we've actually identified one innocent person who's been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and released from death row.
A kind of astonishing error rate - one out of nine people innoc@@ ent.
I mean, it's fascinating.
In avi@@ ation, we would never let people fly on airplan@@ es if for every nine planes that took off one would crash@@ .
But somehow we can insul@@ ate ourselves from this problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our bur@@ den.
It's not our strugg@@ le.
I talk a lot about these issues.
I talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill@@ .
And it's interesting, when I teach my students about African-American history, I tell them about slaver@@ y.
I tell them about terror@@ ism, the era that began at the end of re@@ construction that went on to World War II.
We don't really know very much about it.
But for African-@@ Americans in this country, that was an era defined by terror.
In many communities, people had to worry about being ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ed.
They had to worry about being bombe@@ d.
It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives.
And these older people come up to me now and they say, "M@@ r. Steven@@ son, you give tal@@ ks, you make spee@@ ches, you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation@@ 's history after 9/@@ 11@@ ."
They tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that."
And that era of terror@@ ism, of course, was followed by segreg@@ ation and decades of racial sub@@ ordin@@ ation and aparthe@@ id.
And yet, we have in this country this dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And because of that, we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done histor@@ ically.
We're constantly running into each other.
We're constantly creating ten@@ sions and conflic@@ ts.
We have a hard time talking about race, and I believe it's because we are un@@ willing to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconcili@@ ation.
In South Africa, people understood that we couldn't overcome aparthe@@ id without a commitment to truth and reconcili@@ ation.
In Rwanda, even after the genocid@@ e, there was this commit@@ ment, but in this country we haven't done that.
I was giving some lec@@ tures in Germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty.
It was fascinating because one of the schol@@ ars stood up after the presentation and said, "Well you know it's deeply trou@@ bling to hear what you're talking about@@ ."
He said, "We don't have the death penalty in Germany.
And of course, we can never have the death penalty in German@@ y."
And the room got very qui@@ et, and this woman said, "There's no way, with our history, we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings.
It would be un@@ cons@@ cion@@ able for us to, in an inten@@ tional and deliber@@ ate way, set about execut@@ ing people@@ ."
And I thought about that.
What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was execut@@ ing people, especially if they were dis@@ proportion@@ ately Je@@ wish@@ ?
I couldn't bear it.
It would be un@@ cons@@ cion@@ able.
And yet, in this country, in the states of the O@@ ld Sou@@ th, we exec@@ ute people - where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black, 22 times more likely to get it if the defend@@ ant is black and the victim is white - in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ed.
And yet, there is this dis@@ connec@@ t.
Well I believe that our identity is at risk.
That when we actually don't care about these difficult things, the positive and wonderful things are noneth@@ eless implic@@ ated.
We love innovation.
We love technology. We love creativity.
We love entertain@@ ment.
But ultimately, those real@@ ities are shado@@ wed by suffering, ab@@ use, degrad@@ ation, margin@@ aliz@@ ation.
And for me, it becomes necessary to integrate the two.
Because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hope@@ ful, more commit@@ ted, more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world.
And for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor, the dis@@ advant@@ ag@@ ed, those who will never get to TED.
But thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives.
You know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen.
We do. As rational as we are, as committed to intel@@ lect as we are.
Innov@@ ation, creativity, development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone.
They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fuel@@ ed by some convic@@ tion in our heart.
And it's that mind-@@ heart connection that I believe comp@@ els us to not just be att@@ enti@@ ve to all the bright and d@@ azz@@ ly things, but also the dark and difficult things.
V@@ ac@@ la@@ v H@@ avel@@ , the great C@@ z@@ ech leader, talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with op@@ press@@ ion, we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, an orient@@ ation of the spir@@ it, a willingness to sometimes be in hopel@@ ess places and be a wit@@ ness@@ ."
Well that orient@@ ation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in.
There is no dis@@ connect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering, to poverty, to exclus@@ ion, to un@@ fair@@ ness, to in@@ justice.
Now I will war@@ n you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this.
It will get to you.
I had the great privileg@@ e, when I was a young lawy@@ er, of meeting R@@ osa Par@@ ks.
And M@@ s. Par@@ ks used to come back to Mont@@ go@@ mer@@ y every now and then, and she would get together with two of her de@@ ar@@ est friends, these older women, John@@ nie Car@@ r who was the organiz@@ er of the Mont@@ go@@ mer@@ y bus boy@@ cot@@ t - amazing African-American woman - and Virgin@@ ia Dur@@ r, a white woman, whose husband, C@@ lif@@ ford Dur@@ r, represented Dr. K@@ ing.
And these women would get together and just talk.
And every now and then M@@ s. Car@@ r would call me, and she'd say, "@@ Br@@ y@@ an, M@@ s. Par@@ ks is coming to town. We're going to get together and talk.
Do you want to come over and listen@@ ?"
And I'd say, "Yes, Ma@@ '@@ am, I do."
And she'd say, "Well what are you going to do when you get here?"
I said, "I'm going to listen@@ ."
And I'd go over there and I would, I would just listen.
It would be so energ@@ izing and so empower@@ ing.
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk, and after a couple of hours M@@ s. Par@@ ks turned to me and she said, "@@ Now Br@@ y@@ an, tell me what the E@@ qual Jus@@ tice I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative is.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I began giving her my rap@@ .
I said, "Well we're trying to challenge in@@ justice.
We're trying to help people who have been wrong@@ ly convic@@ ted.
We're trying to confront bias and discrimin@@ ation in the administration of criminal justice.
We're trying to end life without par@@ ole sentences for children.
We're trying to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty.
We're trying to reduce the prison population.
We're trying to end mass incarcer@@ ation."
I gave her my whole rap@@ , and when I finished she looked at me and she said, "M@@ mm mm@@ m mm@@ m."
She said, "That's going to make you ti@@ red, ti@@ red, ti@@ red@@ ."
And that's when M@@ s. Car@@ r lean@@ ed forward, she put her finger in my face, she said, "That's why you've got to be brav@@ e, brav@@ e, brav@@ e."
And I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more cour@@ age@@ ous.
We need to find ways to embrace these challenges, these problems, the suffering.
Because ultimately, our humanity depends on everyone's humanity.
I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do.
It's just taught me very simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done.
I believe that for every person on the planet.
I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a li@@ ar.
I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them, they're not just a thi@@ ef@@ .
I think even if you kill someone, you're not just a kill@@ er.
And because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respec@@ ted by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of this globe, that the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
I don't believe that.
I actually think, in too many places, the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that, despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimul@@ ating, we will ultimately not be jud@@ ged by our technology, we won't be jud@@ ged by our design, we won't be jud@@ ged by our intel@@ lect and reason.
Ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely, you judge the character of a society, not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileg@@ ed, but by how they treat the poor, the con@@ dem@@ ned, the incarcer@@ ated.
Because it's in that nex@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are.
I sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story.
I sometimes push too hard.
I do get ti@@ red, as we all do.
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important.
And I've been representing these kids who have been sent@@ enced to do these very har@@ sh sent@@ ences.
And I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14, and he's been certi@@ fied to stand trial as an adul@@ t.
I start thinking, well, how did that happen?
How can a judge turn you into something that you're not?
And the judge has certi@@ fied him as an adul@@ t, but I see this kid.
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking, well gos@@ h, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not, the judge must have magic power.
Yeah, Br@@ y@@ an, the judge has some magic power.
You should ask for some of that.
And because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real stra@@ ight, I started working on a motion.
And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.
And I started working on this motion, and the head of the motion was: "@@ Mo@@ tion to try my poor, 14@@ -year-old black male client like a privileg@@ ed, white 7@@ 5@@ -year-old corporate exec@@ uti@@ ve."
And I put in my motion that there was prosec@@ ut@@ orial mis@@ conduct and police mis@@ conduct and judici@@ al mis@@ conduc@@ t.
There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this coun@@ ty, it's all mis@@ conduc@@ t.
And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion, or did I actually write it?
And to my horr@@ or, not only had I written it, but I had sent it to cour@@ t.
A couple months went by, and I had just forgotten all about it.
And I finally decided, oh gos@@ h, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case.
And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed - overwhel@@ med.
And I got in my car and I went to this cour@@ thou@@ se.
And I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so pain@@ ful.
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the cour@@ thou@@ se.
And as I was walking up the steps of this cour@@ thou@@ se, there was an older black man who was the jan@@ itor in this cour@@ thou@@ se.
When this man saw me, he came over to me and he said, "Who are you?"
I said, "I'm a lawy@@ er." He said, "You're a lawy@@ er@@ ?" I said, "Yes, sir@@ ."
And this man came over to me and he hug@@ ged me.
And he whis@@ per@@ ed in my ear.
He said, "I'm so proud of you."
And I have to tell you, it was energ@@ iz@@ ing.
It connected deeply with something in me about identity, about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community, to a perspective that is hope@@ ful.
Well I went into the cour@@ tro@@ om.
And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in.
He said, "M@@ r. Steven@@ son, did you write this crazy mo@@ tion@@ ?"
I said, "Yes, s@@ ir. I did@@ ." And we started argu@@ ing.
And people started coming in because they were just outr@@ ag@@ ed.
I had written these crazy things.
And police offic@@ ers were coming in and assist@@ ant prosec@@ ut@@ ors and cl@@ er@@ k workers.
And before I knew it, the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with people angry that we were talking about race, that we were talking about poverty, that we were talking about inequality.
And out of the corner of my eye, I could see this jan@@ itor pac@@ ing back and forth.
And he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this hol@@ ler.
He kept pac@@ ing back and forth.
And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the cour@@ tro@@ om and sat down behind me, almost at coun@@ sel table.
About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break.
And during the break there was a de@@ put@@ y sh@@ er@@ if@@ f who was off@@ ended that the jan@@ itor had come into cour@@ t.
And this de@@ put@@ y jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.
He said, "J@@ im@@ m@@ y, what are you doing in this cour@@ tro@@ om@@ ?"
And this older black man stood up and he looked at that de@@ put@@ y and he looked at me and he said, "I came into this cour@@ tro@@ om to tell this young man, keep your eyes on the pr@@ ize, hold on."
I've come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral ar@@ c of the universe is long, but it b@@ ends toward justice.
That we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dign@@ ity.
That all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone.
That our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity, compassion and justice.
And more than anything, for those of you who share that, I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the pr@@ ize, hold on.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: So you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience, this community, to help you on your way and to do something on this issue.
Other than writing a chec@@ k, what could we do?
B@@ S: Well there are opportunities all around us.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's a refer@@ end@@ um coming up this spring where actually there's going to be an effort to redi@@ rec@@ t some of the money we spend on the politics of punish@@ ment.
For example, here in California we're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years - one billion dollars.
And yet, 46 percent of all homic@@ ide cases don't result in arr@@ est.
56 percent of all rape cases don't result.
So there's an opportunity to change that.
And this refer@@ end@@ um would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and saf@@ ety.
And I think that opportunity exists all around us.
CA: There's been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades.
And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarcer@@ ation r@@ ates.
What would you say to someone who believed that?
B@@ S: Well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively st@@ able.
The great increase in mass incarcer@@ ation in this country wasn't really in violent crime categori@@ es.
It was this mis@@ guid@@ ed war on drugs.
That's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population.
And we got carried away with the rhetor@@ ic of punish@@ ment.
And so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicy@@ cle, for low-@@ level property cri@@ mes, rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victim@@ iz@@ ed.
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victim@@ ized by crime, not do less.
And I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one.
And I think that's the orient@@ ation that we have to change.
CA: Br@@ y@@ an, you've struck a massive chor@@ d here.
You're an inspiring person.
Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: On@@ stage at TED@@ 2012, Peter Di@@ am@@ and@@ is makes a case for optimism - that we'll inv@@ ent, innovate and create ways to solve the challenges that loo@@ m over us. "@@ I’m not saying we don’t have our set of problem@@ s; we surely do. But ultimately, we knock them down@@ .”
Peter Di@@ aman@@ dis@@ : Ab@@ und@@ ance is our future.

Oh, my God.
Peter Di@@ aman@@ dis@@ : So those are just a few of the clips I collected over the last six months - could have easily been the last six days or the last six years.
The point is that the news media prefer@@ entially feeds us negative stories because that's what our minds pay attention to.
And there's a very good reason for that.
Every second of every day, our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains.
And because nothing is more important to us than surviv@@ al, the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sli@@ ver of the temporal lo@@ be called the amy@@ g@@ dal@@ a.
Now the amy@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early warning detec@@ tor, our danger detec@@ tor.
It sorts and s@@ cour@@ s through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us.
So given a dozen news stories, we will prefer@@ entially look at the negative news.
And that old newspaper saying, "If it ble@@ eds it lead@@ s," is very true.
So given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder that we're pessim@@ istic.
It's no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse.
But perhaps that's not the case.
Perhaps instead, it's the distor@@ tions brought to us of what's really going on.
Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century by a series of forces are, in fact, acceler@@ ating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abund@@ ance.
Now I'm not saying we don't have our set of problems - climate crisis, species extinc@@ tion, water and energy short@@ age - we surely do.
And as humans, we are far better at seeing the problems way in adv@@ ance, but ultimately we knock them down.
So let's look at what this last century has been to see where we're going.
Over the last hundred years, the average human lifesp@@ an has more than doub@@ led, average per capita income adjus@@ ted for infl@@ ation around the world has tri@@ ple@@ d.
Chil@@ d@@ hood mortality has come down a factor of 10.
Ad@@ d to that the cost of food, electricity, transport@@ ation, communication have dropped 10 to 1,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ fold.
Steve Pin@@ ker has showed us that, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history.
And Charles Ken@@ ny that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We truly are living in an extraordinary time.
And many people forget this.
And we keep setting our expectations higher and hig@@ her.
In fact, we redefine what poverty means.
Think of this, in America today, the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity, water, toile@@ ts, refriger@@ ators, television, mobile phones, air condition@@ ing and cars.
The weal@@ thi@@ est rob@@ ber bar@@ ons of the last century, the em@@ per@@ ors on this planet, could have never dreamed of such lux@@ uri@@ es.
Under@@ pin@@ ning much of this is technology, and of late, expon@@ entially growing technologies.
My good friend Ray Kurzwe@@ il showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jum@@ ps on this curve, on Moore's La@@ w, and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months.
That's why the cell@@ phone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer of the '70@@ s.
Now look at this curve.
This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to notice two things from this curve.
Number one, how smooth it is - through good time and bad time, war time and peace time, recess@@ ion, depression and bo@@ om time.
This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers.
It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges.
And also, even though it's plot@@ ted on a log curve on the left, it's cur@@ ving up@@ wards.
The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster.
And on this curve, riding on Moore's La@@ w, are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us.
C@@ loud comput@@ ing, what my friends at Aut@@ od@@ es@@ k call infinite comput@@ ing; sensors and net@@ work@@ s; robo@@ tic@@ s; 3D prin@@ ting, which is the ability to democr@@ ati@@ ze and distribute personalized production around the planet@@ ; synthetic biolog@@ y; fuel@@ s, vaccines and food@@ s; digital medic@@ ine@@ ; nano@@ material@@ s; and A.@@ I.
I mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopar@@ dy by I@@ BM@@ 's Wat@@ son@@ ?
I mean, that was e@@ pic@@ .
In fact, I sco@@ ured the headlines looking for the best head@@ line in a newspaper I could.
And I love this: "@@ Watson Van@@ quis@@ hes Human Op@@ pon@@ ent@@ s."
Jeopar@@ d@@ y's not an easy game.
It's about the nu@@ ance of human language.
And imagine if you would A.@@ I.@@ 's like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell@@ phone.
Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzwe@@ il and I started a new university called Sing@@ ular@@ ity Univers@@ ity.
And we teach our students all of these technologies, and particularly how they can be used to solve humanit@@ y's grand challenges.
And every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect posi@@ tively the lives of a billion people within a decade.
Think about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today.
30 years ago that would have sounded lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous.
Today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that.
When I think about creating abund@@ ance, it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet@@ ; it's about creating a life of possibil@@ ity.
It is about taking that which was scar@@ ce and making it abund@@ ant.
You see, scar@@ city is contextu@@ al, and technology is a res@@ ource@@ -@@ liber@@ ating force.
Let me give you an example.
So this is a story of N@@ apo@@ le@@ on I@@ II in the mid-@@ 18@@ 00@@ s.
He's the du@@ de on the left.
He invited over to dinner the king of Si@@ am.
All of N@@ apo@@ le@@ on's troops were fed with silver uten@@ sil@@ s, N@@ apo@@ le@@ on himself with gold uten@@ sil@@ s.
But the King of Si@@ am, he was fed with aluminum uten@@ sil@@ s.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, worth more than gold and plat@@ in@@ um.
It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Mon@@ ument is made of alumin@@ um.
You see, even though aluminum is 8.@@ 3 percent of the Earth by mas@@ s, it doesn't come as a pure metal.
It's all bound by oxygen and sil@@ ic@@ ates.
But then the technology of electr@@ ol@@ ys@@ is came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with thro@@ w@@ -@@ away ment@@ ality.
So let's project this analogy going forward.
We think about energy scar@@ city.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is bath@@ ed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
16 ter@@ a@@ watts of energy hits the Earth's surface every 8@@ 8 minutes.
It's not about being scar@@ ce, it's about access@@ i@@ bil@@ ity.
And there's good news here.
For the first time, this year the cost of solar-@@ generated electricity is 50 percent that of di@@ es@@ el@@ -@@ generated electricity in India - 8.@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es versus 17 ru@@ pe@@ es.
The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade, in the sun@@ ny parts of the United States, solar electricity will be six cents a kilo@@ watt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average.
And if we have abundant energy, we also have abundant water.
Now we talk about water war@@ s.
Do you remember when Carl Sag@@ an turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth, in 1990 after it just passed Satur@@ n@@ ?
He took a famous pho@@ to. What was it cal@@ led@@ ?
"A P@@ ale Blue D@@ ot@@ ."
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water.
Yes, 9@@ 7.@@ 5 percent is sal@@ tw@@ at@@ er, two percent is ice, and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet, but here too there is hope.
And there is technology coming online, not 10, 20 years from now, right now.
There's nano@@ technology coming on, nano@@ materials.
And the conversation I had with Dean Kam@@ en this morning, one of the great DI@@ Y innov@@ ators, I'd like to share with you - he gave me permission to do so - his technology called S@@ ling@@ shot that many of you may have heard of, it is the size of a small dor@@ m room refriger@@ ator.
It's able to generate a thousand lit@@ ers of clean drinking water a day out of any source - sal@@ tw@@ at@@ er, pollu@@ ted water, latr@@ ine - at less than two cents a lit@@ er.
The chair@@ man of Coca-Cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world.
And if that pan@@ s out, which I have every confidence it will, Coca-Cola will deploy this globally to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet.
This is the kind of innovation, empowered by this technology, that exists today.
And we've seen this in cell@@ phones.
My good@@ ness, we're going to hit 70 percent penetr@@ ation of cell@@ phones in the developing world by the end of 201@@ 3.
Think about it, that a Mas@@ ai warri@@ or on a cell@@ phone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile com@@ m than President Reag@@ an did 25 years ago.
And if they're on a smartphone on Google, they've got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago.
They're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predic@@ ted.
Better than that, the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for - GPS, H@@ D video and still images, libr@@ aries of books and music, medical diagnostic technology - are now literally de@@ materi@@ alizing and de@@ mone@@ tiz@@ ing into your cell@@ phone.
Probably the best part of it is what's coming down the pi@@ ke in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announc@@ ing with Qual@@ com@@ m Foundation something called the $@@ 10 million Qual@@ com@@ m Tri@@ cor@@ der X Priz@@ e.
We're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to, because it's got A.@@ I@@ ., you can cou@@ gh on it, you can do a finger blood pric@@ k.
And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of boar@@ d-@@ certi@@ fied doctor@@ s.
So literally, imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers.
When this device sequ@@ ences an RNA or DNA virus that it doesn't recogn@@ ize, it calls the CD@@ C and prev@@ ents the pandemic from happening in the first place.
But here, here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abund@@ ance.
I call it the rising billion.
So the white lines here are population.
We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth.
And by the way, the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy.
In 2010, we had just short of two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, that's going from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation.
What will these people want@@ ?
What will they consum@@ e? What will they desire@@ ?
And rather than having economic shut@@ down, we're about to have the biggest economic injec@@ tion ever.
These people represent tens of trilli@@ ons of dollars injec@@ ted into the global economy.
And they will get healthier by using the Tri@@ cor@@ der, and they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academ@@ y, and by literally being able to use 3D printing and infinite computing [@@ be@@ come@@ ] more productive than ever before.
So what could three billion ris@@ ing, healthy, educa@@ ted, productive members of humanity bring to us?
How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before.
What about giving the op@@ pres@@ sed, wherever they might be, the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever@@ ?
What will these three billion people br@@ ing?
What about contribu@@ tions we can't even predic@@ t?
The one thing I've learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things, things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past.
Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited.
There is a program that some of you might have heard of.
It's a game called Fol@@ d@@ it.
It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle.
And this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of am@@ ino acid@@ s and figure out how the protein is going to fold.
And how it folds dic@@ ta@@ tes its structure and its function@@ ality.
And it's very important for research in medicine.
And up until now, it's been a super@@ computer problem.
And this game has been played by university professors and so forth.
And it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it.
And it showed that, in fact, today, the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers.
And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein fol@@ der in the world, it wasn't an MIT professor, it wasn't a Cal@@ T@@ ech student, it was a person from England, from Manch@@ est@@ er, a woman who, during the day, was an executive assist@@ ant at a re@@ ha@@ b clinic and, at night, was the world's best protein fol@@ der.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the DI@@ Y innov@@ ator.
We have the capital of the tech@@ no-@@ philanthrop@@ ist.
And we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges, to do that which we must do.
We are living into extraordinary decades ahead.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The ocean has degrad@@ ed within our life@@ times, as shown in the decre@@ asing average size of fish. And yet, as Daniel Paul@@ y shows us on@@ stage at Mis@@ sion Blu@@ e, each time the bas@@ eline dro@@ ps, we call it the new "@@ normal@@ ." At what point do we stop read@@ jus@@ ting down@@ war@@ d?
Daniel Paul@@ y: The oce@@ an's shifting bas@@ el@@ ine.
I'm going to speak about a tiny, little idea.
And this is about shifting bas@@ el@@ ine.
And because the idea can be explained in one minute, I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time.
And the first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my hero@@ es.
And he was here, as you well know, in '@@ 3@@ 5.
And you'd think he was chasing fin@@ ches, but he was@@ n't.
He was actually collecting fish.
And he described one of them as very "@@ common@@ ."
This was the sail@@ f@@ in grou@@ per.
A big fisher@@ y was run on it until the '80@@ s.
Now the fish is on the I@@ UC@@ N Red L@@ ist.
Now this story, we have heard it lots of times on Galapag@@ os and other places, so there is nothing particular about it.
But the point is, we still come to Galapag@@ os.
We still think it is pr@@ ist@@ ine.
The br@@ och@@ ures still say it is un@@ touch@@ ed.
So what happens here?
The second story, also to illustrate another concept, is called shifting wa@@ ist@@ line.
Because I was there in '@@ 7@@ 1, studying a lago@@ on in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa.
And I thought I could bl@@ end in.
And I got a big sun@@ bur@@ n, and I was convinced that I was really not from there.
This was my first sun@@ bur@@ n.
And the lago@@ on was surrounded by palm trees, as you can see, and a few man@@ gro@@ ve.
And it had til@@ ap@@ ia about 20 centi@@ meters, a species of til@@ ap@@ ia called black@@ ch@@ in til@@ ap@@ ia.
And the fisheries for this til@@ ap@@ ia sustain@@ ed lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Gh@@ ana.
When I went there 27 years later, the fish had sh@@ run@@ k to half of their size.
They were ma@@ turing at five centi@@ meters.
They had been pushed genetic@@ ally.
There were still fish@@ es.
They were still kind of happy.
And the fish also were happy to be there.
So nothing has changed, but everything has changed.
My third little story is that I was an accompl@@ ice in the introduction of tra@@ w@@ ling in Sou@@ theast Asia.
In the '70@@ s - well, beginning in the '60s - Europe did lots of development projects.
F@@ ish development meant impos@@ ing on countries that had already 100,000 fisher@@ s to im@@ pose on them industrial fish@@ ing.
And this boat, quite ug@@ ly, is called the Mu@@ ti@@ ara 4.
And I went sa@@ iling on it, and we did surve@@ ys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the J@@ ava Se@@ a.
And what we cau@@ gh@@ t, we didn't have words for it.
What we cau@@ gh@@ t, I know now, is the bottom of the sea.
And 90 percent of our catch were spon@@ ges, other animals that are fixed on the bottom.
And actually most of the fish, they are a little spot on the debr@@ is, the piles of debr@@ is, were coral reef fish.
Es@@ senti@@ ally the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down.
And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid@@ .
Within a year, you do a survey and then commercial fishing begin@@ s.
The bottom is transformed from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral into a mud@@ dy m@@ ess.
This is a dead tur@@ tle.
They were not eat@@ en, they were thrown away because they were dead.
And one time we caught a live one.
It was not dro@@ wn@@ ed yet.
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.
This mountain of debr@@ is is actually collected by fisher@@ s every time they go into an area that's never been f@@ ished.
But it's not docum@@ ented.
We transform the world, but we don't remember it.
We adjust our bas@@ eline to the new level, and we don't recall what was there.
If you gener@@ alize this, something like this happens.
You have on the y axis some good thing: biodivers@@ ity, numbers of or@@ ca, the green@@ ness of your country, the water suppl@@ y.
And over time it changes - it changes because people do things, or natur@@ ally.
Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapol@@ ate forward.
And the difference then, they perceive as a loss.
But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.
You can have a success@@ ion of changes.
At the end you want to sustain miserable lef@@ to@@ vers.
And that, to a large ex@@ tent, is what we want to do now.
We want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were.
Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predat@@ ory societies, they killed animals and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abund@@ ant, before it gets extinc@@ t, it becomes r@@ are.
So you don't lose abundant animals.
You always lose rare animals.
And therefore they're not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we concentrate on large animals, and in a sea that means the big fish.
They become rar@@ er because we fish them.
Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the bas@@ el@@ ine.
And the question is, why do people accept this?
Well because they don't know that it was different.
And in fact, lots of people, scientists, will cont@@ est that it was really different.
And they will cont@@ est this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence pres@@ ented.
For example, the anecdo@@ te that some present, as Cap@@ tain so-@@ and-@@ so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utiliz@@ ed by fisher@@ y scientists, because it's not "@@ scientific@@ ."
So you have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in liter@@ ate societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
And h@@ ence, the enormous role that a marine protected area can play.
Because with marine protected areas, we actually re@@ create the past.
We re@@ create the past that people cannot conce@@ ive because the bas@@ eline has shifted and is extremely low.
That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provid@@ es, which enables them to res@@ et their bas@@ el@@ ine.
How about the people who can't do that because they have no access - the people in the Mid@@ west for example@@ ?
There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the g@@ ap, and simul@@ ation.
This is a simulation of Ch@@ es@@ ape@@ ake B@@ ay.
There were gray whales in Ch@@ es@@ ape@@ ake Bay a long time ago - 500 years ago.
And you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar."
And if you think about "A@@ v@@ at@@ ar@@ ," if you think of why people were so touched by it - never mind the P@@ oc@@ ah@@ on@@ tas story - why so touched by the imag@@ er@@ y?
Because it ev@@ o@@ kes something that in a sense has been lost.
And so my recommen@@ d@@ ation, it's the only one I will provid@@ e, is for Cameron to do "A@@ v@@ atar I@@ I@@ " under@@ water.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Kevin Al@@ loc@@ ca is YouTu@@ be@@ 's trends manag@@ er, and he has deep thoughts about silly web video. In this talk from TED@@ You@@ th, he shares the 4 reasons a video goes vir@@ al.
Kevin Al@@ loc@@ ca@@ : Why videos go vir@@ al.
H@@ i. I'm Kevin Al@@ loc@@ ca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube, and I profession@@ ally watch YouTube videos.
It's true.
So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters.
We all want to be stars - cele@@ bri@@ ties, sing@@ ers, comedi@@ ans - and when I was youn@@ ger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.
But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture.
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Satur@@ day.
But there are over 48 hours of video uplo@@ aded to YouTube every minute.
And of that, only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.
So how does it happen?
Three things: tas@@ te@@ makers, communities of participation and un@@ expec@@ ted@@ ness.
All right, let's go.
Be@@ ar Vas@@ que@@ z: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God@@ !
Wo@@ o@@ o!
O@@ hhhh@@ h, wo@@ ww@@ ww@@ !
KA: Last year, Be@@ ar Vas@@ que@@ z posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Y@@ os@@ emite National Park.
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.
This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer.
But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, B@@ ear.
He just wanted to share a rain@@ bo@@ w.
Because that's what you do when your name is Y@@ os@@ emite Mountain B@@ ear.
And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.
And this video had actually been posted all the way back in Jan@@ u@@ ary.
So what happened here?
Jimmy Kim@@ mel actually.
Jimmy Kim@@ mel posted this twe@@ et that would eventually pro@@ pel the video to be as popular as it would be@@ come.
Because tas@@ te@@ makers like Jimmy Kim@@ mel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience.
Re@@ becca Black@@ : ♫ It's Fr@@ id@@ ay, Fr@@ id@@ ay. G@@ ot@@ ta get down on Fr@@ id@@ ay. ♫ ♫ Every@@ body's looking forward to the week@@ end, week@@ end. ♫ ♫ Fr@@ id@@ ay, Fr@@ id@@ ay. Get@@ tin@@ ' down on Fr@@ id@@ ay. ♫ KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope.
Re@@ becca Black@@ 's "@@ Fr@@ id@@ ay@@ " is one of the most popular videos of the year.
It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.
This is a chart of what it looked like.
And similar to "D@@ ou@@ ble Rain@@ bow@@ ," it seems to have just spr@@ ou@@ ted up out of nowhere.
So what happened on this day?
Well it was a Fr@@ id@@ ay, this is true.
And if you're wondering about those other spi@@ kes, those are also Fr@@ id@@ ay@@ s.
But what about this day, this one particular Fr@@ id@@ ay?
Well T@@ os@@ h@@ .@@ 0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.
Michael J. Nelson from My@@ ster@@ y Science The@@ ater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that an individual or a group of tas@@ te@@ makers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience, acceler@@ ating the process.
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it.
And now there are 10,000 par@@ odi@@ es of "@@ Fr@@ id@@ ay@@ " on YouTube.
Even in the first seven days, there was one par@@ ody for every other day of the week.
Unlike the one-@@ way entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon - either by spreading it or by doing something new with it.
So "N@@ y@@ an Cat@@ " is a loo@@ ped animation with loo@@ ped music.
It's this, just like this.
It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.
And if you think that that is weir@@ d, you should know that there is a three-@@ hour version of this that's been viewed four million times.
Even cats were watching this video.
C@@ ats were watching other cats watch this video.
But what's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this tech@@ ie, gee@@ ky Internet culture.
There were remix@@ es.
Someone made an old time@@ y ver@@ sion.
And then it went internation@@ al.
An entire remix community spr@@ ou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of.
Because we don't just enjoy now, we participa@@ te.
And who could have predicted any of this?
Who could have predicted "D@@ ou@@ ble Rain@@ bow@@ " or Re@@ becca Black or "N@@ y@@ an Cat@@ ?"
What scrip@@ ts could you have written that would have contained this in it?
In a world where over two days of video get uplo@@ aded every minute, only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have.
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protest@@ ing bicycle fin@@ es in New York City, I admit I wasn't very intereste@@ d.
Cas@@ ey Ni@@ estat@@ : So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lan@@ e, but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lan@@ e.
KA: By being totally surprising and humor@@ ous, Cas@@ ey Ni@@ est@@ at got his funny idea and point seen five million times.
And so this approach holds for anything new that we do cre@@ ati@@ vely.
And so it all brings us to one big question ...
Be@@ ar Vas@@ que@@ z: What does this mean?
O@@ hh@@ h@@ h.
KA: What does it mean?
Tas@@ te@@ makers, creative participating communities, complete un@@ expec@@ ted@@ ness, these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defin@@ es the popular@@ ity.
I mean, as mentioned earlier, one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Jus@@ tin Bi@@ e@@ ber, got his start on YouTube.
No one has to gre@@ en-@@ light your idea.
And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture.
And these are not characteristics of old media, and they're barely true of the media of today, but they will define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In 2010, technolog@@ ist T@@ an L@@ e took the TEDGlobal stage to demo a powerful new interface. But now, at TEDx@@ Women, she tells a very personal stor@@ y: the story of her family - mother, grandmother and sister - fle@@ eing Vietnam and building a new life.
T@@ an Le@@ : My immigr@@ ation story.
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three generations, about how the astonishing strength of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl h@@ ud@@ d@@ led with her young sis@@ ter, her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago, bon@@ ds that took hold in the life of that small girl.
And never let go - that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today?
This is not a finished story.
It is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle still being put together.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piec@@ e: a man burning his life's work.
He is a po@@ et, a play@@ w@@ right, a man whose whole life had been bal@@ anced on the single hope of his country's un@@ ity and freedom.
Imagine him as the commun@@ ists enter Sa@@ ig@@ on, confron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste.
W@@ ord@@ s, for so long his friends, now m@@ oc@@ ked him.
He re@@ treated into silence.
He died broken by history.
He is my grand@@ father.
I never knew him in real life.
But our lives are much more than our memor@@ ies.
My grandmother never let me forget his life.
My duty was not to allow it to have been in v@@ ain, and my lesson was to learn that, yes, history tried to crus@@ h us, but we end@@ ure@@ d.
The next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a boat in the early dawn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea.
My mother, Ma@@ i, was 18 when her father died - already in an arrang@@ ed marri@@ age, already with two small girls.
For her, life had dis@@ til@@ led itself into one tas@@ k: the escape of her family and a new life in Australia.
It was in@@ conce@@ iv@@ able to her that she would not succe@@ ed.
So after a four-@@ year s@@ aga that de@@ fies fic@@ tion, a boat sli@@ pped out to sea dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as a fishing vess@@ el.
All the adults knew the ris@@ ks.
The greatest fear was of pir@@ ates, rape and death.
Like most adults on the boat, my mother carried a small bottle of pois@@ on.
If we were cap@@ ture@@ d, first my sister and I, then she and my grandmother would drin@@ k.
My first memories are from the boat - the steady beat of the engine, the bow di@@ pping into each wave, the vast and empty horiz@@ on.
I don't remember the pir@@ ates who came many times, but were blu@@ ff@@ ed by the brav@@ ado of the men on our boat, or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil ri@@ g off the Mal@@ ay@@ sian coast and the young man who collapsed and died, the journe@@ y's end too much for him, and the first apple I tas@@ ted, given to me by the men on the rig@@ .
No apple has ever tas@@ ted the same.
After three months in a refugee cam@@ p, we landed in Mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne.
And the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together.
We settled in Fo@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay, a work@@ ing-@@ class sub@@ ur@@ b whose demographic is layers of immigr@@ ants.
Unlike the settled middle-@@ class suburb@@ s, whose existence I was ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of, there was no sense of entit@@ le@@ ment in Fo@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay.
The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world.
And the sni@@ p@@ pets of hal@@ ting English were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common@@ , they were starting again.
My mother worked on far@@ ms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double shif@@ ts.
Some@@ how she found time to study English and gain I@@ T qualific@@ ations.
We were poor.
All the dollars were alloc@@ ated and extra tu@@ ition in English and mathematics was bud@@ geted for regardless of what missed out, which was usually new clo@@ thes@@ ; they were always second@@ hand.
Two pairs of stock@@ ings for school, each to hide the holes in the other.
A school uni@@ form down to the ank@@ les, because it had to last for six years.
And there were rare but sear@@ ing ch@@ ants of "@@ s@@ lit@@ -@@ ey@@ e" and the occasion@@ al graf@@ fi@@ ti@@ : "A@@ si@@ an, go home@@ ."
Go home to wher@@ e?
Something sti@@ f@@ fen@@ ed inside me.
There was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying, "I will by@@ pass you."
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhaus@@ ted each night, but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house.
My mother suffered from nightmar@@ es all about the boat.
And my job was to stay a@@ wake until her nightmar@@ es came so I could wake her.
She opened a computer store then studied to be a beauti@@ ci@@ an and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transi@@ tion, angry and inf@@ lexi@@ ble, and troub@@ led children caught between two world@@ s.
Gr@@ ants and sponsor@@ s were s@@ ough@@ t.
Cent@@ ers were establ@@ ished.
I lived in parallel world@@ s.
In one, I was the classic Asian student, rel@@ ent@@ less in the demands that I made on myself.
In the other, I was en@@ mes@@ hed in lives that were pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous, trag@@ ically scar@@ red by violence, drug abuse and isol@@ ation.
But so many over the years were hel@@ ped.
And for that work, when I was a final year law student, I was chosen as the young Australian of the year.
And I was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another, and their edges didn't f@@ it.
T@@ an L@@ e, anonymous Fo@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay resid@@ ent, was now T@@ an L@@ e, refugee and social activ@@ ist, invited to speak in venu@@ es she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagin@@ ed.
I didn't know the protocol@@ s.
I didn't know how to use the cut@@ l@@ ery.
I didn't know how to talk about win@@ e.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to re@@ treat to the rout@@ ines and comfort of life in an un@@ sun@@ g sub@@ ur@@ b - a grand@@ mother, a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years, telling one another the story of their day and falling asle@@ ep, the three of us still in the same bed.
I told my mother I couldn't do it.
She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boar@@ ded the boat.
No had never been an option.
"@@ Just do it@@ ," she said, "@@ and don't be what you're not@@ ."
So I spoke out on youth unemploy@@ ment and education and the neg@@ lect of the margin@@ alized and the dis@@ enfr@@ anch@@ is@@ ed.
And the more candid@@ ly I spo@@ ke, the more I was asked to speak.
I met people from all walks of life, so many of them doing the thing they lo@@ ved, living on the fronti@@ ers of possibil@@ ity.
And even though I finished my degre@@ e, I realized I could not set@@ tle into a career in law.
There had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw.
And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an out@@ sid@@ er, a recent arri@@ v@@ al, new on the scene - and not just okay, but something to be thank@@ ful for, perhaps a gift from the boat.
Because being an ins@@ ider can so easily mean collap@@ sing the horiz@@ ons, can so easily mean accepting the presum@@ p@@ tions of your prov@@ inc@@ e.
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that, yes, the world does fall apart, but not in the way that you fear.
Pos@@ si@@ bil@@ ities that would not have been allowed were outr@@ age@@ ously encour@@ ag@@ ed.
There was an energy there, an im@@ plac@@ able optim@@ ism, a strange mixture of humil@@ ity and dar@@ ing.
So I followed my hun@@ ches.
I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label "It can't be don@@ e" was an ir@@ resis@@ tible challenge.
For a year we were pen@@ n@@ il@@ ess.
At the end of each day, I made a huge pot of soup which we all shar@@ ed.
We worked well into each night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but a few were brilli@@ ant, and we broke through.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After only one tri@@ p.
My hun@@ ches again.
Three months later I had rel@@ oc@@ ated, and the adventure has continu@@ ed.
Before I close though, let me tell you about my grand@@ mother.
She grew up at a time when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local Mand@@ ar@@ in was the person who mat@@ ter@@ ed.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died soon after she was born.
Her mother raised her alone.
At 17 she became the second wife of a Mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother beat her.
With no support from her husband, she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosec@@ ut@@ ing her own case, and a far greater sensation when she w@@ on.
"It can't be don@@ e" was shown to be wrong.
I was taking a sho@@ wer in a hotel room in Syd@@ ney the moment she died 600 miles away in Mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne.
I looked through the sho@@ wer screen and saw her standing on the other side.
I knew she had come to say goodby@@ e.
My mother phon@@ ed minutes later.
A few days later, we went to a Buddhist tem@@ ple in Fo@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay and sat around her cas@@ k@@ et.
We told her stories and as@@ sured her that we were still with her.
At mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the cas@@ k@@ et.
My mother asked us to feel her hand.
She asked the mon@@ k, "Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so col@@ d@@ ?"
"@@ Because you have been holding it since this mor@@ n@@ ing," he said.
"You have not let it go."
If there is a sin@@ e@@ w in our family, it runs through the women.
Gi@@ ven who we were and how life had shaped us, we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us.
De@@ fe@@ at would have come too easily.
Now I would like to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could ever wish it on their own@@ ?
Yet I am afraid of privileg@@ e, of eas@@ e, of entit@@ le@@ ment.
Can I give them a bow in their lives, di@@ pping br@@ avel@@ y into each wave, the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and steady beat of the engine, the vast horiz@@ on that guarante@@ es no@@ thing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and still see them safely through, I woul@@ d.

TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Has our technology - our cell phones and iPods and cameras - stopped us from dream@@ ing? Young artist Sh@@ ilo Shi@@ v Su@@ le@@ man says no, as she demos "K@@ ho@@ y@@ a," her new story@@ book for iP@@ ad, which flo@@ ats us through a magical world in 7 minutes of pure creativity.
Sh@@ ilo Shi@@ v Su@@ le@@ man: Using tech to enable dream@@ ing.
My story begins right here actually in Raj@@ as@@ than about two years ago.
I was in the deser@@ t, under the star@@ ry sk@@ ies with the Su@@ fi sing@@ er Mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar Ali@@ .
And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian e@@ pic "The Mah@@ ab@@ har@@ at@@ a."
So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel we'd jump into a ch@@ ari@@ ot and we'd zoom across the sky.
Now we do the same with airplan@@ es.
Back then, when Ar@@ jun@@ a, the great Indian warri@@ or princ@@ e, when he was thir@@ st@@ y, he'd take out a bo@@ w, he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.
Now we do the same with dr@@ ills and machines.
The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machin@@ ery.
And this made me really s@@ ad.
I found myself becoming a little bit of a tech@@ no@@ pho@@ be.
I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me, without twe@@ eting it to my friends.
And it felt like technology should enable mag@@ ic, not kill it.
When I was a little girl, my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.
And this piece of 50@@ -year-old technology became the most magical thing to me.
It became a g@@ il@@ ded gate@@ way into a world full of pir@@ ates and ship@@ wrec@@ ks and images in my imagination.
So I felt like our cell@@ phones and our fancy wat@@ ches and our cameras had stopped us from dream@@ ing.
They stopped us from being inspi@@ red.
And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology, to see how I could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it.
I've been illustr@@ ating books since I was 16.
And so when I saw the iP@@ ad, I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world.
It can know how we're holding it.
It can know where we are.
It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch.
Story@@ telling is becoming more and more multi-@@ sensori@@ al.
But what are we doing with it?
So I'm actually just going to go in and launch K@@ ho@@ y@@ a, an interactive app for the iP@@ ad.
So it says, "P@@ l@@ ace your fingers upon each ligh@@ t."
And so - It says, "This box belongs to ... " And so I type in my name.
And actually I become a character in the book.
At various points, a little letter drops down to me - and the iP@@ ad knows where you live because of GPS - which is actually add@@ ressed to me.
The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities.
Now I've been talking a lot about magic.
And I don't mean w@@ iz@@ ards and drag@@ ons, I mean the kind of childhood mag@@ ic, those ideas that we all har@@ bored as children.
This idea of firef@@ lies in a j@@ ar, for some reason, was always really exciting to me.
And so over here you need to til@@ t your iP@@ ad, take the firef@@ lies out.
And they actually illumin@@ ate your way through the rest of the book.
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single mar@@ ble.
And so over here, each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that I drag in to this magical device within the device.
And it opens up a map.
All along, all fantas@@ y books have always had map@@ s, but these maps have been static@@ .
This is a map that grows and g@@ lows and becomes your navig@@ ation for the rest of the book.
It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.
So I'm just going to enter in.
Another thing that's actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contempor@@ ary.
Over here, these are the Ap@@ sar@@ as.
So we've all heard about fa@@ iri@@ es and we've all heard about n@@ ym@@ ph@@ s, but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counter@@ parts, the Ap@@ sar@@ as?
These poor Ap@@ sar@@ as have been trapped inside In@@ dra@@ 's cham@@ bers for thousands of years in an old and mus@@ ty book.
And so we're bringing them back in a contemporary story for children.
And a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis.
Spe@@ aking of the environmental crisis, I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms, glu@@ ed to their P@@ C@@ s, they haven't been able to get out.
But now with mobile technology, we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is that you're sent off on this quest where you need to go outside, take out your camera on the iP@@ ad and collect pictures of different natural objects.
When I was a child, I had multiple collec@@ tions of sticks and stones and pe@@ b@@ bles and sh@@ ell@@ s.
And somehow kids don't do that anymore.
So in bringing back this childhood ritu@@ al, you need to go out and, in one chap@@ ter, take a picture of a flower and then tag it.
In another chap@@ ter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then tag that.
And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online.
A child in London puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says, "Oh, I saw a fo@@ x today@@ ."
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today@@ ."
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you've actually tak@@ en.
In the possibilities of linking together mag@@ ic, the earth and technology, there are multiple possibilities.
In the next book, we plan on having an interaction where you take your iP@@ ad out with the video on and through aug@@ mented reality, you see this layer of anima@@ ted pix@@ ies appear on a house@@ plant that's outside your house.
At one point, your screen is filled up with leav@@ es.
And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book.
We're moving, we're all moving here, to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology, and magic and technology can come closer together.
We're har@@ ness@@ ing energy from the sun.
We're bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: You can use your smartphone to find a local AT@@ M, but what if you need a de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ator@@ ? Lu@@ ci@@ en En@@ gel@@ en shows us online innovations that are changing the way we save lives, including a crowd@@ sourc@@ ed map of local de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators.
Lu@@ ci@@ en En@@ gel@@ en: Cro@@ w@@ d@@ source your health.
I would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projects fail.
And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at Rad@@ b@@ ou@@ d University is we ap@@ pointed a chief listening offic@@ er.
Not in a very scientific way - she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients, family, relativ@@ es, "What's up?
How could we help you?"
And we think, we like to think, that this is one of the major problems why all - maybe not all - but most of the e-@@ health projects fa@@ il, since we stopped listening.
This is my Wi@@ F@@ i scale. It's a very simple thing.
It's got one kno@@ b, on@@ /@@ off.
And every morning I hop on it.
And yes, I've got a challenge, as you might see.
And I put my challenge on 95 kg.
But the thing is that it's made this simple that whenever I hop on, it sends my data through Google Health as well.
And it's collected by my general prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er as well, so he can see what's my problem in weight, not on the very moment that I need cardi@@ ologic support or something like it, but also looking back@@ ward.
But there's another thing.
As some of you might know, I've got more than 4,000 follow@@ ers on Twitter.
So every morning I hop on my Wi@@ F@@ i scale and before I'm in my car, people start talking to me, "I think you need a light lunch today, Lu@@ ci@@ en@@ ."
But that's the nic@@ est thing that could happen, since this is peer pressure, peer pressure used to help patients - since this could be used for obes@@ ity, it could be used to stop smoking in patients.
But on the other hand, it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gam@@ ing activity to get more control of their health.
As of next week, it will soon be available.
There will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other.
And people will be able, from their homes, to take their blood pressure, send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others, for instance, for over a hundred dollars.
And this is the point where patients get into position and can collec@@ t, not only their own control again, be cap@@ tain of their own ship, but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face, like health care cost explos@@ ion, doubled demand and things like that.
Make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team.
And you can do this with techniques like this, but also by crow@@ d-@@ sourc@@ ing.
And one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video.
We've all got navig@@ ation controls in our car.
We maybe even [@@ hav@@ e] it in our cell@@ phone.
We know perfectly where all the AT@@ M@@ s are about the city of Ma@@ as@@ tric@@ h@@ t.
The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are.
And sure, we could find fast food chain@@ s.
But where would be the nearest A@@ E@@ D to help this patient@@ ?
We asked around and nobody kne@@ w.
Nobody knew where the nearest life-@@ saving A@@ E@@ D was to be obtain@@ ed right now.
So what we did, we crowd@@ sourc@@ ed The Nether@@ lands.
We set up a website and asked the crow@@ d, "If you see an A@@ E@@ D, please submit it, tell us where it is, tell us when it's open@@ ," since sometimes in office hours sometimes it's clos@@ ed, of course.
And over 10,000 A@@ ED@@ s already in The Nether@@ lands already have been submit@@ ted.
The next step we took was to find the applications for it.
And we built an iP@@ ad applic@@ ation.
We made an application for L@@ ay@@ ar, aug@@ mented reality, to find these A@@ ED@@ s.
And whenever you are in a city like Ma@@ as@@ tric@@ h@@ t and somebody collap@@ ses, you can use your iPhone, and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cell@@ phone, to find the nearest A@@ E@@ D which can save lives.
And as of today, we would like to introduce this, not only as A@@ ED@@ 4@@ EU@@ , which is what the product is called, but also A@@ ED@@ 4@@ U@@ S.
And we would like to start this on a worldwide level.
And [@@ we@@ '@@ re@@ ] asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world, colleague universi@@ ties, to help us to find and work and act like a hu@@ b to crow@@ d-@@ source all these A@@ ED@@ s all around the world.
That whenever you're on hol@@ iday and somebody collap@@ ses, might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you, you can find this.
The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us valid@@ ate these A@@ ED@@ s.
These might be cou@@ ri@@ er services or cable guys for instance, just to see whether the A@@ E@@ D that's submit@@ ted still is in place.
So please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better, but take control of it.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Erik Joh@@ ans@@ son creates realistic photos of impossible scenes - captur@@ ing ideas, not moment@@ s. In this wit@@ ty how@@ -@@ to, the Photos@@ hop w@@ iz@@ ard describes the principles he uses to make these fantas@@ tical scenari@@ os come to life, while keeping them visually plaus@@ ible.
Erik Joh@@ ans@@ son: Im@@ possible photograph@@ y.
I'm here to share my photograph@@ y.
Or is it photograph@@ y?
Because, of course, this is a photograph that you can't take with your camera.
Yet, my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15.
It mixed with my earlier passion for draw@@ ing, but it was a bit different, because using the camera, the process was in the planning instead.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends when you press the trig@@ ger.
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time.
I felt like anyone could do that.
So I wanted to create something different, something where the process starts when you press the trig@@ ger.
Pho@@ tos like this: construction going on along a busy road.
But it has an unexpected tw@@ ist.
And despite that, it re@@ tains a level of real@@ ism.
Or photos like these - both dark and color@@ ful, but all with a common goal of re@@ tain@@ ing the level of real@@ ism.
When I say real@@ ism, I mean photo@@ -@@ real@@ ism.
Because, of course, it's not something you can capture really, but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph.
Pho@@ tos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the tric@@ k.
So it's more about captur@@ ing an idea than about captur@@ ing a moment really.
But what's the trick that makes it look real@@ istic@@ ?
Is it something about the details or the color@@ s?
Is it something about the ligh@@ t?
What creates the illus@@ ion@@ ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illus@@ ion.
But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface.
It's not really what is real@@ istic, it's what we think looks realistic really.
So I think the basic@@ s are quite simple.
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create altern@@ ate reality.
And let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly imagin@@ able physical objects, something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way, they can create something that still looks three-@@ dimension@@ al, like it could exist.
But at the same time, we know it can't.
So we trick our brains, because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process with combin@@ ing photograph@@ s.
It's just really about combin@@ ing different real@@ ities.
So the things that make a photograph look real@@ istic, I think it's the things that we don't even think about, the things all around us in our daily lives.
But when combin@@ ing photographs, this is really important to consid@@ er, because otherwise it just looks wrong some@@ how.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result.
As you can see, these images aren't really special.
But combin@@ ed, they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective.
Secondly, photos combined should have the same type of light.
And these two images both ful@@ fill these two require@@ ments - shot at the same height and in the same type of light.
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seam@@ less.
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was compos@@ ed.
So by mat@@ ching color, contrast and brigh@@ t@@ ness in the borders between the different images, adding photograph@@ ic defec@@ ts like depth of field, des@@ atur@@ ated colors and nois@@ e, we er@@ ase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image, despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically.
So here's another example.
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what's manipul@@ ated.
But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different loc@@ ations.
I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place than to find a place, because then you don't need to com@@ promise with the ideas in your head.
But it does require a lot of plan@@ ning.
And getting this idea during winter@@ , I knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically.
So for example, the fish was captured on a fishing tri@@ p.
The sh@@ ores are from a different loc@@ ation.
The underwater part was captured in a stone p@@ it.
And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swe@@ dis@@ h.
So to achieve a realistic result, I think it comes down to plan@@ ning.
It always starts with a sket@@ ch, an idea.
Then it's about combin@@ ing the different photograph@@ s.
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned.
And if you do a good job captur@@ ing the pho@@ tos, the result can be quite beautiful and also quite real@@ istic.
So all the tools are out there, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: From deep in the TED arch@@ ive, Danny Hill@@ is out@@ lines an intriguing theory of how and why technological change seems to be acceler@@ ating, by linking it to the very evolution of life itself. The presentation techniques he uses may look d@@ ated, but the ideas are as relevant as ever.
Danny Hill@@ is: Back to the future.
Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be, and I thought that, since I was among friends here, I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jum@@ ps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it.
So I'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide.
And then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on.
This is just a random slide that I picked out of my fi@@ le.
What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide, but the general form of it.
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of RIS@@ C micro@@ process@@ ors versus the power of local area networks.
And the interesting thing about it is that this slide, like so many technology slides that we're used to, is a sort of a straight line on a semi@@ -lo@@ g curve.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale.
And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi@@ -lo@@ g curv@@ es.
Something really weird is going on here.
And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about.
So, if you could bring up the lights.
If you could bring up the lights hig@@ her, because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.
Now why do we draw technology curves in semi@@ -lo@@ g curv@@ es?
Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve where, let's say, this is years, this is time of some sor@@ t, and this is whatever measure of the technology that I'm trying to graph, the graphs look sort of s@@ ill@@ y.
They sort of go like this.
And they don't tell us much.
Now if I graph, for instance, some other technology, say transportation technology, on a semi@@ -lo@@ g curve, it would look very stup@@ id, it would look like a flat line.
But when something like this happens, things are qualit@@ atively changing.
So if transportation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ proc@@ essor technology, then the day after tomorrow, I would be able to get in a tax@@ i ca@@ b and be in Toky@@ o in 30 seconds.
It's not moving like that.
And there's nothing preced@@ ented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years.
Now the question that I'd like to ask is, if you look at these exponential curv@@ es, they don't go on forever.
Things just can't possibly keep changing as fast as they are.
One of two things is going to happen.
E@@ ither it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-@@ curve like this, until something totally different comes along, or maybe it's going to do this.
That's about all it can do.
Now I'm an optim@@ ist, so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.
If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now is a transi@@ tion.
We're sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is.
And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself, is what's this new way that the world is?
What's that new state that the world is heading to@@ war@@ d?
Because the transition seems very, very conf@@ using when we're right in the middle of it.
Now when I was a kid growing up, the future was kind of the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
Now here's a conference in which people talk about the future, and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000.
It's about as far as we go out.
So in other words, the future has kind of been shrin@@ king one year per year for my whole lifetime.
Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that some@@ thing's happening there.
That transition is happening. We can all sense it.
And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense to think out 30, 50 years because every@@ thing's going to be so different that a simple extrapol@@ ation of what we're doing just doesn't make any sense at all.
So what I would like to talk about is what that could be, what that transition could be that we're going through.
Now in order to do that I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers.
Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things.
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth.
So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time.
So if you go back about two and a half billion years, the Earth was this big, ster@@ ile hun@@ k of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it.
And if you look at the way that the chemicals got organiz@@ ed, we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.
And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RN@@ A, but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it, which is that, at that time, there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different re@@ cip@@ es of chemicals in them.
And some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorpor@@ ate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil.
And those that were like that started to split and divid@@ e.
And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense, those little drops of oil.
But now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now, because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemic@@ als.
And every time it divid@@ ed, they got sort of un@@ equal division of the chemicals within them.
And so every drop was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorpor@@ ating chemicals around them, grew more and incorpor@@ ated more chemicals and divided more.
So those ten@@ ded to live longer, get expressed more.
Now that's sort of just a very simple chemical form of life, but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstr@@ action.
Some@@ how by ways that we don't quite understand, these little drops learned to write down information.
They learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA.
So in other words, they worked out, in this mind@@ less sort of evolutionary way, a form of writing that let them write down what they were, so that that way of writing it down could get copi@@ ed.
The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.
In fact the recipe for us, our genes, is exactly that same code and that same way of writing.
In fact, every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
In fact, one of the things that I did just for am@@ use@@ ment purpos@@ es is we can now write things in this code.
And I've got here a little 100 micro@@ grams of white pow@@ der, which I try not to let the security people see at airport@@ s.
But this has in it - what I did is I took this code - the code has standard letters that we use for symbol@@ izing it - and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and ampli@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times.
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card, I have plenty for everyone in the room, and, in fact, everyone in the world, and it's right here.
If I had really been a e@@ goti@@ st, I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.
So what was the next ste@@ p@@ ?
W@@ r@@ iting down the DNA was an interesting step.
And that caused these cells - that kept them happy for another billion years.
But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different, which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communicating information, so that they began to get communities of cells.
I don't know if you know this, but bacteria can actually exchange DNA.
Now that's why, for instance, antibio@@ tic resistance has evol@@ ved.
Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penic@@ ill@@ in, and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria, and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penic@@ ill@@ in, because bacteria communicate.
Now what this communication allowed was communities to form that, in some sense, were in the same boat together@@ ; they were syn@@ erg@@ istic.
So they survived or they failed together, which means that if a community was very successful, all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favor@@ ed by evolution.
Now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that, in fact, they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of DNA.
And so the next stage that's interesting in life took about another billion years.
And at that stage, we have multi-@@ cellular communities, communities of lots of different types of cells, working together as a single organis@@ m.
And in fact, we're such a multi-@@ cellular community.
We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore.
Your skin cell is really us@@ eless without a heart cell, muscle cell, a brain cell and so on.
So these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell, but a community which we call an organis@@ m.
Now the next step that happened is within these communities.
These communities of cells, again, began to abstract information.
And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community.
And those are the neural structures.
So neurons are the information processing appar@@ at@@ us that those communities of cells built up.
And in fact, they began to get speci@@ alists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recor@@ ding, understanding, learning information.
And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advant@@ age.
Because at that point, an individual - learning could happen within the time span of a single organis@@ m, instead of over this evolutionary time sp@@ an.
So an organism could, for instance, learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tas@@ ted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organis@@ m, whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures, that would have had to be learned evolution@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fru@@ it.
So that nervous system, the fact that they built these special information structures, tremend@@ ously spe@@ d up the whole process of evolution.
Because evolution could now happen within an individual.
It could happen in learning time scales.
But then what happened was the individuals worked out, of course, tricks of communic@@ ating.
And for example, the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.
It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.
Here I have a very complicated, mess@@ y, confused idea in my head.
I'm sitting here making gr@@ un@@ ting sounds basically, and hopefully constructing a similar mess@@ y, confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it.
But we're taking something very complicated, turning it into sound, sequ@@ ences of sounds, and producing something very complicated in your brain.
So this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organis@@ m.
And so, in fact, what we've done is we, humanity, have started abstr@@ acting out.
We're going through the same levels that multi-@@ cellular organisms have gone through - abstr@@ acting out our methods of recor@@ ding, present@@ ing, processing information.
So for example, the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction.
T@@ eleph@@ on@@ y, computers, vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ es, CD@@ -@@ RO@@ M@@ s and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we've now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information.
And it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before.
So now, evolution can take place on a scale of micros@@ econ@@ ds.
And you saw T@@ y's little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Con@@ volu@@ tion program right before your eyes.
So now we've spee@@ ded up the time scales once again.
So the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece.
And the next steps, like nervous systems and brains, took a few hundred million years.
Then the next steps, like language and so on, took less than a million years.
And these next steps, like electron@@ ics, seem to be taking only a few decades.
The process is feeding on itself and be@@ coming, I guess, aut@@ oc@@ at@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it - when something rein@@ forces its rate of change.
The more it changes, the faster it changes.
And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.
We're seeing this process feeding back on itself.
Now I design computers for a living, and I know that the mechanisms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers.
So right now, what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.
I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.
There are billions of them.
Instead, what I do and what the designers at Th@@ in@@ king Mach@@ ines do is we think at some level of abstr@@ action and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do, much farther and faster than we could ever do.
And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods that we don't quite even understand.
One method that's particularly interesting that I've been using a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself.
So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micros@@ econ@@ d time scale.
So for example, in the most extreme cases, we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions.
S@@ ay, "@@ Compu@@ ter, would you please make a hundred million random sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions.
Now would you please run all of those random sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions, run all of those programs, and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wan@@ ted@@ ."
So in other words, I define what I wanted.
Let's say I want to sort numbers, as a simple example I've done it with.
So find the programs that come closest to sor@@ ting numbers.
So of course, random sequ@@ ences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers, so none of them will really do it.
But one of them, by luc@@ k, may put two numbers in the right order.
And I say, "@@ Compu@@ ter, would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequ@@ ences that did the best job.
S@@ ave those. K@@ ill off the rest@@ .
And now let's reproduce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best.
And let's reproduce them by a process of re@@ combination analog@@ ous to sex@@ ."
Take two programs and they produce children by ex@@ changing their su@@ br@@ out@@ ines, and the children inher@@ it the traits of the su@@ br@@ out@@ ines of the two programs.
So I've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combin@@ ations of the programs that did a little bit better job.
S@@ ay, "P@@ lease repeat that process@@ ."
S@@ core them again.
In@@ tr@@ od@@ u@@ ce some mutations perhap@@ s.
And try that again and do that for another generation.
Well every one of those generations just takes a few millisecon@@ ds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes, or in the complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end of that, I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers.
In fact, they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand.
Now if I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.
They're obs@@ c@@ ure, weird programs.
But they do the job.
And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.
In fact, their life depen@@ ded on doing the job.
I was riding in a 7@@ 47 with Mar@@ vin M@@ ins@@ ky once, and he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this.
It says, '@@ This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe f@@ light@@ .' Doesn't that make you feel confid@@ ent@@ ?"
In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well when it gets complicated.
So we're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that's very different than engineering.
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce.
And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it.
So in a sense, it's getting ahead of us.
We're now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we'll be able to run this process much faster.
So it's feeding back on itself.
The thing is becoming faster and that's why I think it seems so confus@@ ing.
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves.
We're taking off.
And what we are is we're at a point in time which is analog@@ ous to when single-@@ cel@@ led organisms were turning into multi-@@ cel@@ led organisms.
So we're the amo@@ eb@@ as and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're cre@@ ating.
We're right at that point of transi@@ tion.
But I think that there really is something coming along after us.
I think it's very h@@ augh@@ ty of us to think that we're the end product of evolution.
And I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is.
So lunch is coming along, and I think I will stop at that point, before I get selected out.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Every doctor makes mistakes. But, says physician Brian Gold@@ man, medicin@@ e's culture of denial keeps doctors from ever talking about those mistak@@ es, or using them to learn and impro@@ ve. T@@ elling stories from his own long practice, he calls on doctors to start talking about being wrong.
Brian Gold@@ man: Doc@@ tors make mistakes. Can we talk about that?
I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change.
And I think it starts with one physici@@ an, and that's me.
And maybe I've been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false presti@@ ge to be able to do that.
Before I actually begin the meat of my talk, let's begin with a bit of base@@ ball.
Hey, why not?
We're near the end, we're getting close to the World Ser@@ ies.
We all love base@@ ball, don't we?
Bas@@ e@@ ball is filled with some amazing statistics.
And there's hundreds of them.
"@@ Mon@@ ey@@ ball@@ " is about to come out, and it's all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one st@@ at that I hope a lot of you have heard of.
It's called bat@@ ting average.
So we talk about a 3@@ 00, a bat@@ ter who bats 3@@ 00.
That means that ball@@ player bat@@ ted safel@@ y, hit safely three times out of 10 at bat@@ s.
That means hit the ball into the out@@ field, it drop@@ ped, it didn't get cau@@ gh@@ t, and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time and the run@@ ner was safe.
Three times out of 10.
Do you know what they call a 300 h@@ it@@ ter in Maj@@ or Le@@ ague Bas@@ eb@@ all?
Go@@ od, really good, maybe an all-@@ star.
Do you know what they call a 400 baseball h@@ it@@ ter?
That's somebody who h@@ it, by the way, four times safely out of every 10.
Leg@@ end@@ ary - as in Ted Willi@@ ams legend@@ ary - the last Maj@@ or Le@@ ague Bas@@ e@@ ball player to hit over 400 during a regular season.
Now let's take this back into my world of medicine where I'm a lot more comfort@@ able, or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I'm going to talk to you about.
Suppose you have ap@@ pen@@ dic@@ iti@@ s and you're referred to a surgeon who's bat@@ ting 400 on ap@@ pen@@ dec@@ to@@ mi@@ es.
Some@@ how this isn't working out, is it?
Now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has block@@ ages in two coron@@ ary arteri@@ es and your family doctor refer@@ s that loved one to a cardi@@ ologist who's bat@@ ting 200 on angi@@ o@@ plas@@ ties.
But, but, you know what?
She's doing a lot better this year. She's on the come@@ back tra@@ il.
And she's hitting a 25@@ 7.
Some@@ how this isn't working.
But I'm going to ask you a question.
What do you think a bat@@ ting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ er or an orth@@ ope@@ dic surge@@ on, an O@@ B@@ G@@ Y@@ N, a parame@@ dic is supposed to be?
1,@@ 00@@ 0, very good.
Now truth of the matter is, nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or parame@@ dic is supposed to bat@@ .
What we do though is we send each one of them, including myself, out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ i@@ tion, be perfect.
Never ever, ever make a mistak@@ e, but you worry about the deta@@ ils, about how that's going to happen.
And that was the message that I absor@@ bed when I was in med school.
I was an obsess@@ ive compul@@ sive student.
In high school, a class@@ mate once said that Brian Gold@@ man would study for a blood test.
And so I did.
And I studied in my little gar@@ re@@ t at the nur@@ s@@ es' resid@@ ence at Tor@@ onto General Hos@@ pit@@ al, not far from here.
And I memor@@ ized everything.
I memor@@ ized in my an@@ at@@ omy class the origins and exer@@ tions of every mus@@ cle, every branch of every ar@@ tery that came off the a@@ or@@ ta, differ@@ ential diagnos@@ es obs@@ cure and common.
I even knew the differ@@ ential diagnosis in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tub@@ ular acid@@ os@@ is.
And all the while, I was am@@ ass@@ ing more and more knowledge.
And I did well, I graduated with hon@@ ors, c@@ um lau@@ de.
And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memor@@ ized everything and knew everything, or as much as possible, as close to everything as possible, that it would immun@@ ize me against making mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met M@@ r@@ s. Dr@@ uck@@ er.
I was a resid@@ ent at a teaching hospital here in Tor@@ onto when M@@ r@@ s. Dr@@ uc@@ ker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working.
At the time I was assigned to the cardi@@ ology service on a cardi@@ ology rot@@ ation.
And it was my job, when the emergency staff called for a cardi@@ ology consul@@ t, to see that patient in emerg@@ .
And to report back to my attend@@ ing.
And I saw M@@ r@@ s. Dr@@ uck@@ er, and she was breath@@ less.
And when I listened to her, she was making a whe@@ ez@@ y sound.
And when I listened to her chest with a ste@@ thos@@ co@@ pe, I could hear crack@@ ly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in con@@ g@@ estive heart failure.
This is a condition in which the heart fail@@ s, and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward, some of the blood backs up into the lun@@ g, the lun@@ gs fill up with blood, and that's why you have short@@ ness of brea@@ th.
And that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make.
I made it and I set to work treating her.
I gave her aspir@@ in. I gave her medic@@ ations to reli@@ eve the str@@ ain on her heart.
I gave her medic@@ ations that we call di@@ ure@@ tics, water pill@@ s, to get her to pe@@ e out the access flu@@ id.
And over the course of the next hour and a half or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt really good.
And that's when I made my first mist@@ ake@@ ; I sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
I sent her home without speaking to my attend@@ ing.
I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do, which was call my att@@ ending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself.
And he knew her, he would have been able to fur@@ n@@ ish additional information about her.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a high-@@ maintenance resid@@ ent.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attend@@ ing's patients without even having to contact him.
The second mistake that I made was worse.
In sending her home, I dis@@ regar@@ ded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me, "@@ Gold@@ man, not a good idea. Don't do this."
In fact, so lac@@ king in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after M@@ r@@ s. Dr@@ uck@@ er, "Do you think it's okay if she goes home@@ ?"
And the nurse thought about it and said very mat@@ ter-@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly, "Yeah, I think she@@ 'll do ok@@ ay@@ ."
I can remember that like it was yester@@ day.
So I signed the dis@@ charge papers, and an ambul@@ ance came, par@@ am@@ ed@@ ics came to take her home.
And I went back to my work on the wards.
All the rest of that day, that afternoon, I had this kind of g@@ na@@ wing feeling inside my stomach@@ .
But I carried on with my work.
And at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don't usually do.
I walked through the emergency department on my way home.
And it was there that another nur@@ se, not the nurse who was looking after M@@ r@@ s. Dr@@ uc@@ ker before, but another nur@@ se, said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dre@@ ad.
Others in medicine dre@@ ad them as well, but there's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fle@@ et@@ ing@@ ly.
The three words are@@ : Do you remember@@ ?
"Do you remember that patient you sent home@@ ?"
The other nurse asked mat@@ ter-@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly.
"Well she's back@@ ," in just that tone of voice.
Well she was back all right.
She was back and near death.
About an hour after she had arrived home, after I'd sent her home, she collapsed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the par@@ am@@ ed@@ ics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50, which is in severe shoc@@ k.
And she was barely breathing and she was blue.
And the emerg@@ . staff pulled out all the stop@@ s.
They gave her medic@@ ations to raise her blood press@@ ure.
They put her on a v@@ enti@@ lat@@ or.
And I was shocked and shak@@ en to the co@@ re.
And I went through this rol@@ ler coas@@ ter, because after they stabil@@ ized her, she went to the intensive care un@@ it, and I hoped against hope that she would recover@@ .
And over the next two or three days, it was clear that she was never going to wake up.
She had irrever@@ sible brain damage.
And the family gather@@ ed.
And over the course of the next eight or nine days, they res@@ igned themselves to what was happening.
And at about the nine day mark, they let her go - M@@ r@@ s. Dr@@ uck@@ er, a wife, a mother and a grand@@ mother.
They say you never forget the names of those who die.
And that was my first time to be ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ ted with that.
Over the next few weeks, I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the un@@ healthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine - where I felt alone, isol@@ ated, not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel, because you can't talk about it with your colleagu@@ es.
You know that healthy kind, when you be@@ tray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get bus@@ ted and then your best friend confron@@ ts you and you have terrible discus@@ sions, but at the end of it all that sick feeling gu@@ ides you and you say, I'll never make that mistake again.
And you make am@@ ends and you never make that mistake again.
That's the kind of shame that is a teacher.
The un@@ healthy shame I'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside.
It's the one that says, not that what you did was bad, but that you are bad.
And it was what I was feeling.
And it wasn't because of my attend@@ ing; he was a dol@@ l.
He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoo@@ th@@ ed things over and made sure that I didn't get su@@ ed.
And I kept asking myself these questions.
Why didn't I ask my attend@@ ing? Why did I send her home@@ ?
And then at my worst moment@@ s: Why did I make such a stupid mist@@ ake@@ ?
Why did I go into medicin@@ e?
S@@ low@@ ly but su@@ rely, it lif@@ ted.
I began to feel a bit better.
And on a clou@@ dy day, there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered, maybe I could feel better again.
And I made myself a bar@@ gain that if only I red@@ ou@@ ble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again, please make the voices stop.
And they did.
And I went back to work.
And then it happened again.
Two years later I was an att@@ ending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toron@@ to, and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sor@@ e thro@@ at.
It was bus@@ y, I was in a bit of a hur@@ ry.
He kept pointing here.
I looked at his thro@@ at, it was a little bit pin@@ k.
And I gave him a prescription for penic@@ ill@@ in and sent him on his way.
And even as he was walking out the door, he was still sort of pointing to his thro@@ at.
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shif@@ t, and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quiet@@ ly in her office.
And she said the three word@@ s: Do you remember@@ ?
"Do you remember that patient you saw with the sor@@ e thro@@ at@@ ?"
Well it turns out, he didn't have a stre@@ p thro@@ at.
He had a potentially life-@@ threatening condition called ep@@ ig@@ lot@@ ti@@ tis.
You can Google it, but it's an infec@@ tion, not of the thro@@ at, but of the upper air@@ way, and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close.
And fortunately he didn't die.
He was placed on intr@@ aven@@ ous antibiotics and he re@@ covered after a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and re@@ crimin@@ ations and felt clean@@ sed and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Tw@@ ice in one emergency shif@@ t, I missed ap@@ pen@@ dic@@ iti@@ s.
Now that takes some doing, especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night.
Now in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think there was any gap in their care.
One I thought had a kidney st@@ one.
I ordered a kidney X-@@ ra@@ y. When it turned out to be normal, my colleague who was doing a re@@ assess@@ ment of the patient noticed some tend@@ er@@ ness in the right lower quadr@@ ant and called the surge@@ ons.
The other one had a lot of diarrhe@@ a.
I ordered some flu@@ ids to re@@ hydr@@ ate him and asked my colleague to re@@ ass@@ ess him.
And he did and when he noticed some tend@@ er@@ ness in the right lower quadr@@ ant, called the surge@@ ons.
In both cases, they had their operations and they did okay.
But each time, they were g@@ na@@ wing at me, eating at me.
And I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say, which is total B.@@ S.
Some of my do@@ oz@@ ies have been in the last five years.
A@@ lon@@ e, ash@@ amed and un@@ suppor@@ ted.
Here's the problem: If I can't come clean and talk about my mistak@@ es, if I can't find the stil@@ l-@@ small voice that tells me what really happened, how can I share it with my colleagu@@ es?
How can I teach them about what I did so that they don't do the same thing?
If I were to walk into a room - like right now, I have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after fail@@ ure@@ ?
Oh yeah, you go to a cock@@ tail party and you might hear about some other doctor, but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
If I were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I've just told you right now, I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfort@@ able, somebody would crack a jo@@ ke, they'd change the subject and we would move on.
And in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orth@@ ope@@ dic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital, believe me, I'd have trouble making eye contact with that person.
That's the system that we have.
It's a complete denial of mistakes.
It's a system in which there are two kinds of physicians - those who make mistakes and those who don't, those who can't handle sleep de@@ priv@@ ation and those who can, those who have l@@ ous@@ y outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an ide@@ ological reac@@ tion, like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person.
And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine, what will we be left with, but a safe system.
But there are two problems with that.
In my 20 years or so of medical broadcas@@ ting and journ@@ alism, I've made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical errors to learn everything I can, from one of the first articles I wrote for the Tor@@ onto Star to my show "@@ White Co@@ at, Black Ar@@ t."
And what I've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquit@@ ous.
We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one in 10 medic@@ ations are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dos@@ age, where hospit@@ al-@@ acquired infec@@ tions are getting more and more numer@@ ous, causing hav@@ o@@ c and death.
In this country, as many as 24@@ ,000 Canadi@@ ans die of prevent@@ able medical err@@ ors.
In the United States, the Institute of Medic@@ ine peg@@ ged it at 100@@ ,000.
In both cases, these are gross under@@ esti@@ mates, because we really aren't fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we shoul@@ d.
And here's the thing.
In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years, we can't keep up with it.
S@@ le@@ ep de@@ priv@@ ation is absolutely pervas@@ ive.
We can't get rid of it.
We have our cognitive bi@@ as@@ es, so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain.
Now take the same patient with chest pain, make them mo@@ ist and garr@@ ul@@ ous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath, and suddenly my history is lac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t.
I don't take the same history.
I'm not a robo@@ t; I don't do things the same way each time.
And my patients aren't car@@ s; they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time.
Gi@@ ven all of that, mistakes are inevit@@ able.
So if you take the system, as I was tau@@ gh@@ t, and we@@ ed out all the err@@ or-@@ pr@@ one health profession@@ als, well there won't be anybody left.
And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cas@@ es?
On my show, on "@@ White Co@@ at, Black Ar@@ t@@ ," I made it a habit of saying, "@@ Here's my worst mist@@ ake@@ ," I would say to everybody from par@@ am@@ ed@@ ics to the chief of cardiac surgery, "@@ Here's my worst mist@@ ake@@ ," bl@@ ah, bl@@ ah, bl@@ ah, bl@@ ah, bl@@ ah, "What about your@@ s?" and I would point the micro@@ phone towards them.
And their pup@@ ils would dil@@ ate, they would re@@ co@@ il, then they would look down and swal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stories.
They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories.
They want to be able to say, "Look, don't make the same mistake I did@@ ."
What they need is an environment to be able to do that.
What they need is a re@@ defined medical culture.
And it starts with one physician at a time.
The re@@ defined physician is human, knows she's human, accep@@ ts it, isn't proud of making mistak@@ es, but str@@ ives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else.
She shares her experience with others.
She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes.
And she points out other people's mistak@@ es, not in a got@@ cha way, but in a lo@@ ving, supportive way so that everybody can benef@@ it.
And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowled@@ ges that human beings run the system, and when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time.
So the system is evolving to create back@@ ups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fos@@ ters in a lo@@ ving, supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewar@@ ded for doing so, and especially people like me, when we do make mistak@@ es, we're rewar@@ ded for coming cle@@ an.
My name is Brian Gold@@ man.
I am a re@@ defined physici@@ an.
I'm human. I make mistakes.
I'm sorry about that, but I str@@ ive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people.
I still don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.
And let me close with three words of my own@@ : I do remem@@ ber.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We all want custom@@ ized experiences and products - but when faced with 700 options, consumers free@@ ze up. With fascinating new research, She@@ ena I@@ y@@ eng@@ ar demonstrates how businesses can improve the experience of choos@@ ing.
She@@ ena I@@ y@@ eng@@ ar: How to make choosing easier.
Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day?
Do you know how many choices you make in typical week@@ ?
I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans, and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about 70 in a typical day.
There was also recently a study done with CEOs in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these CEOs engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tas@@ ks.
And they found that the average CEO engaged in about 13@@ 9 tasks in a week.
Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-@@ choices of course.
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less.
Only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time.
Think about your own choices.
Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour categor@@ y?
How well do you think you're doing at managing those cho@@ ic@@ es?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have, which is the choice over@@ load problem.
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions.
Now as I talk about this problem, I'm going to have some questions for you and I'm going to want to know your answers.
So when I ask you a question, since I'm blind, only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calori@@ es.
Other@@ wise, when I ask you a question, and if your answer is yes, I'd like you to cl@@ ap your hands.
So for my first question for you today@@ : Are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ load problem?
Thank you.
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University, I used to go to this very, very up@@ scale grocery stor@@ e; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale.
It was a store called Dra@@ eg@@ er@@ 's.
Now this store, it was almost like going to an am@@ use@@ ment park.
They had 250 different kinds of mus@@ tar@@ ds and vin@@ eg@@ ars and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ its and veget@@ ables and more than two dozen different kinds of bott@@ led water - and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.
I used to love going to this store, but on one occas@@ ion I asked myself, well how come you never buy any@@ thing?
Here's their ol@@ ive oil ais@@ le.
They had over 75 different kinds of ol@@ ive oil, including those that were in a locked case that came from thousand@@ -year-old ol@@ ive trees.
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manag@@ er, and I asked the manag@@ er, "Is this model of offering people all this choice really work@@ ing?"
And he pointed to the bus@@ loads of tour@@ ists that would show up every@@ day, with cameras ready usu@@ ally.
We decided to do a little experiment, and we picked jam for our experiment.
Here's their jam ais@@ le.
They had 3@@ 48 different kinds of j@@ am.
We set up a little tas@@ ting boo@@ th right near the entr@@ ance of the store.
We there put out six different flav@@ ors of jam or 24 different flav@@ ors of j@@ am, and we looked at two things: First, in which case were people more likely to stop, sample some jam@@ ?
More people stopped when there were 2@@ 4, about 60 percent, than when there were six, about 40 percent.
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of j@@ am.
Now we see the opposite effect.
Of the people who stopped when there were 2@@ 4, only three percent of them actually bought a jar of j@@ am.
Of the people who stopped when there were six, well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of j@@ am.
Now if you do the math, people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 2@@ 4.
Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us - at least it's good for our wa@@ ist@@ lines - but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem affects us even in very consequ@@ ential decisions.
We choose not to choos@@ e, even when it goes against our best self-@@ interests.
So now for the topic of today@@ : financial sav@@ ings.
Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gu@@ r Hub@@ er@@ man, Em@@ ir Kam@@ en@@ ica, W@@ ei Jan@@ g where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 6@@ 50 plans all in the U.S.
And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offer@@ ings available in a retirement savings plan, the 40@@ 1 plan, does that affect people's likelihood to save more for tomorrow.
And what we found was that indeed there was a cor@@ rel@@ ation.
So in these plan@@ s, we had about 6@@ 57 plans that rang@@ ed from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offer@@ ings.
And what we found was that, the more funds offer@@ ed, indeed, there was less participation rate.
So if you look at the extrem@@ es, those plans that offered you two fund@@ s, participation rates were around in the mid-@@ 70@@ s - still not as high as we want it to be.
In those plans that offered nearly 60 fund@@ s, participation rates have now dropped to about the 60@@ th per@@ centi@@ le.
Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present, even then, it has negative consequences.
So for those people who did choose to participa@@ te, the more choices available, the more likely people were to completely avoid stoc@@ ks or equ@@ ity fund@@ s.
The more choices available, the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accoun@@ ts.
Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well-being.
Well, over the past decade, we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices.
They're more likely to del@@ ay choosing - proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ate even when it goes against their best self-@@ interest.
They're more likely to make worse choices - worse financial choices, medical choices.
They're more likely to choose things that make them less satis@@ fied, even when they do objec@@ tively better.
The main reason for this is because, we might enjoy gaz@@ ing at those giant walls of may@@ on@@ n@@ ais@@ es, mus@@ tar@@ ds, vin@@ eg@@ ars, jam@@ s, but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contras@@ ting and actually picking from that stunning dis@@ play.
So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques - techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venu@@ es - that you can easily apply in your businesses.
The first@@ : C@@ ut.
You've heard it said before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, "C@@ ut@@ ."
They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.
But in fact, what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut, get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous redund@@ ant options, well there's an increase in sal@@ es, there's a low@@ ering of costs, there is an improvement of the choosing experience.
When Proc@@ tor &amp; Gam@@ ble went from 26 different kinds of He@@ ad &amp; S@@ hou@@ l@@ ders to 15, they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.
When the Golden C@@ at Corpor@@ ation got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling cat lit@@ ter products, they saw an increase in profits by 8@@ 7 percent - a function of both increase in sales and low@@ ering of costs.
You know, the average grocery store today offers you 4@@ 5,000 products.
The typical Wal@@ mart today offers you 100,000 products.
But the nin@@ th largest re@@ tail@@ er, the nin@@ th biggest re@@ tail@@ er in the world today is Al@@ di, and it offers you only 1,@@ 400 products - one kind of can@@ ned toma@@ to sauc@@ e.
Now in the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offer@@ ings has actually been something that David La@@ ib@@ son was heavily involved in design@@ ing, which was the program that they have at Harvard.
Every single Harvard employe@@ e is now automatically enrol@@ led in a lif@@ ec@@ y@@ cle fund@@ .
For those people who actually want to choos@@ e, they're given 20 fund@@ s, not 300 or more fund@@ s.
You know, often, people say, "I don't know how to cut@@ .
They're all important cho@@ ic@@ es."
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees, "T@@ ell me how these choices are different from one another.
And if your employees can't tell them apart, neither can your consum@@ er@@ s."
Now before we started our session this afternoon, I had a chat with G@@ ary.
And Gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all-@@ ex@@ pens@@ es-@@ paid free vac@@ ation to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here's a description of the road.
And I'd like you to read it.
And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to cl@@ ap your hands if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer@@ .
Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer@@ .
Is that all?
All right, let me show you some more about this.
You guys knew there was a tric@@ k, didn't you.
Now who's ready to go on this tri@@ p.
I think I might have actually heard more hands.
All right.
Now in fact, you had objec@@ tively more information the first time around than the second time around, but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around.
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you.
Which brings me to the second technique for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem, which is concre@@ tiz@@ ation.
That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices, they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice, and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivi@@ d sort of way, in a very concrete way.
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an AT@@ M card or a credit card as opposed to cas@@ h?
Because it doesn't feel like real money.
And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more.
So a study that I did with Sh@@ lo@@ mo Ben@@ art@@ zi and Al@@ ess@@ and@@ ro Pre@@ vit@@ er@@ o, we did a study with people at IN@@ G - employees that are all working at IN@@ G - and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrol@@ l@@ ment for their 40@@ 1 plan.
And during that sess@@ ion, we kept the session exactly the way it used to be, but we added one little thing.
The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more.
By doing that simple thing, there was an increase in enrol@@ l@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent.
The third techni@@ que: C@@ ate@@ g@@ oriz@@ ation.
We can handle more categor@@ ies than we can handle choices.
So for example, here's a study we did in a magazine ais@@ le.
It turns out that in W@@ eg@@ man@@ s grocery stores up and down the nor@@ theast corrid@@ or, the magazine ais@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 31 different kinds of magaz@@ ines all the way up to 6@@ 6@@ 4.
But you know what?
If I show you 600 magaz@@ ines and I divide them up into 10 categori@@ es, versus I show you 400 magaz@@ ines and divide them up into 20 categori@@ es, you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 6@@ 00.
Because the categor@@ ies tell me how to tell them apart.
Here are two different jewel@@ ry dis@@ play@@ s.
One is called "J@@ azz@@ " and the other one is called "S@@ w@@ ing."
If you think the display on the left is S@@ wing and the display on the right is J@@ az@@ z, cl@@ ap your hands.
Okay, there's some@@ .
If you think the one on the left is J@@ az@@ z and the one on the right is Sw@@ ing, cl@@ ap your hands.
Okay, a bit more.
Now it turns out you're right.
The one on the left is J@@ az@@ z and the one on the right is Sw@@ ing, but you know what?
This is a highly us@@ eless categoriz@@ ation sche@@ me.
The categor@@ ies need to say something to the choos@@ er, not the cho@@ ic@@ e-@@ maker.
And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these fund@@ s.
Who are they actually supposed to be inform@@ ing?
My fourth techni@@ que: Con@@ di@@ tion for complexity.
It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can, we've just got to take it a little easier.
We have to gradually increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.
Let's take a very, very complicated decision@@ : buying a car.
Here's a German car manufac@@ ture@@ r that gives you the opportunity to completely cus@@ tom make your car.
You've got to make 60 different decisions, completely make up your car.
Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision.
C@@ ar colors, exterior car colors - I've got 56 choices.
En@@ gin@@ es, g@@ ear@@ shift - four choices.
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appe@@ ar.
So half of the customers are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors, to low choice, four g@@ ear@@ shif@@ ts.
The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice, four g@@ ear@@ shif@@ ts, to 56 car colors, high choice.
What am I going to look at?
How engaged you are.
If you keep hitting the default button per decision, that means you're getting overwhel@@ med, that means I'm losing you.
What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice, they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.
We're losing them.
They go from low choice to high choice, they're hanging in there.
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.
The only thing that I have done is I have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is pres@@ ented.
If I start you off easy, I learn how to choos@@ e.
Even though choosing g@@ ear@@ shift doesn't tell me anything about my prefer@@ ences for interior decor@@ , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choos@@ e.
It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together, so I'm more willing to be motivated to be engag@@ ed.
So let me re@@ cap@@ .
I have talked about four techniques for mitig@@ ating the problem of choice over@@ load - cut - get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous altern@@ ativ@@ es; concre@@ tize - make it real@@ ; categor@@ ize - we can handle more categori@@ es, less cho@@ ic@@ es; condition for complexity.
All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices - better for you, you can use them on yourself, better for the people that you are serv@@ ing.
Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choos@@ y about choos@@ ing.
And the more we're able to be choos@@ y about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choos@@ ing.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Cy@@ ber@@ crime expert Mik@@ ko H@@ yp@@ pon@@ en talks us through three types of online attack on our privacy and data - and only two are considered cri@@ mes. "Do we blind@@ ly trust any future government@@ ? Because any right we give away, we give away for good@@ ."
Mik@@ ko H@@ yp@@ pon@@ en: Three types of online attack.
In the 198@@ 0s in the commun@@ ist Eastern Germany, if you owned a type@@ writer, you had to reg@@ ister it with the government.
You had to reg@@ ister a sample sheet of text out of the type@@ writ@@ er.
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from.
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought, they could track down who created that thought.
And we in the West couldn't understand how anybody could do this, how much this would restric@@ t freedom of speech.
We would never do that in our own countries.
But today in 2011, if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufac@@ ture@@ r and print a page, that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer@@ .
This is happening to us today.
And nobody seems to be making a fus@@ s about it.
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us, the citizens.
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today.
If we take a look at what's really happening in the online world, we can group the attacks based on the attack@@ ers.
We have three main groups.
We have online crimin@@ als.
Like here, we have Mr. Dimi@@ try Gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of Ki@@ e@@ v in Ukrain@@ e.
And the motiv@@ es of online criminals are very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use online attacks to make lots of money, and lots and lots of it.
We actually have several cases of million@@ aire@@ s online, multi@@ million@@ air@@ es, who made money with their attacks.
Here's V@@ lad@@ im@@ ir T@@ s@@ ast@@ s@@ in form T@@ art@@ u in Est@@ on@@ ia.
This is Alfred Gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z.
This is Stephen Wat@@ t.
This is B@@ jor@@ n Sund@@ in.
This is Matthew Ander@@ son, T@@ ari@@ q Al-@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on.
These guys make their fortun@@ es online, but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking tro@@ j@@ ans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online ban@@ king, or with key@@ log@@ gers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer.
The U.S. Secre@@ t Ser@@ v@@ ice, two months ago, fro@@ ze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam J@@ ain right here, and that bank account had 14@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was froz@@ en.
Mr. J@@ ain himself is on the loos@@ e; nobody knows where he is.
And I claim it's already today that it's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world.
And it's very obvious that this is only going to get worse.
In the future, the majority of crime will be happening online.
The second major group of attack@@ ers that we are watching today are not motivated by money.
They're motivated by something else - motivated by protest@@ s, motivated by an opinion, motivated by the laugh@@ s.
Grou@@ ps like An@@ on@@ ymous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks.
So those are the three main attack@@ er@@ s: criminals who do it for the money, hack@@ tiv@@ ists like An@@ on@@ ymous doing it for the protest@@ , but then the last group are nation states, governments doing the attacks.
And then we look at cases like what happened in Dig@@ i@@ No@@ tar.
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens.
Dig@@ i@@ No@@ tar is a Cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate Au@@ thor@@ ity from The Nether@@ lands - or actually, it was.
It was running into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were hac@@ ked into.
Somebody broke in and they hac@@ ked it thor@@ ough@@ ly.
And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government represent@@ atives, I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pl@@ a@@ usi@@ ble that people died because of the Dig@@ i@@ No@@ tar hac@@ k.
And his answer was yes.
So how do people die as the result of a h@@ ack like this?
Well Dig@@ i@@ No@@ tar is a C.@@ A.
They sell certific@@ ates.
What do you do with certific@@ at@@ es?
Well you need a certific@@ ate if you have a website that has h@@ t@@ t@@ ps, S@@ S@@ L encryp@@ ted services, services like G@@ ma@@ il.
Now we all, or a big part of us, use G@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors, but these services are especially popular in total@@ itarian states like Iran, where dissid@@ ents use foreign services like G@@ mail because they know they are more trust@@ worthy than the local services and they are encryp@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connec@@ tions, so the local government can't s@@ no@@ op on their discus@@ sions.
Except they can if they h@@ ack into a foreign C.@@ A.
And issue ro@@ gue certific@@ ates.
And this is exactly what happened with the case of Dig@@ i@@ No@@ tar.
What about Arab Spr@@ ing and things that have been happening, for example, in Eg@@ y@@ pt@@ ?
Well in Egyp@@ t, the ri@@ o@@ ters loo@@ ted the head@@ quarters of the Egyptian secret police in A@@ pri@@ l 2011, and when they were loo@@ ting the building they found lots of papers.
A@@ mon@@ g those papers, was this b@@ ind@@ er entit@@ led "F@@ IN@@ F@@ IS@@ H@@ E@@ R@@ ."
And within that b@@ ind@@ er were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting - and in very large scale - all the communication of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 2@@ 80,000 Eur@@ os to the Egyptian government.
The company head@@ quarters are right here.
So Western governments are providing total@@ itarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens.
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Tro@@ j@@ an was found, which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are a suspect in a criminal case, well it's pretty obvious, your phone will be t@@ appe@@ d.
But today, it goes beyond that.
They will tap your Internet connection.
They will even use tools like State Tro@@ j@@ an to infec@@ t your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an, which enables them to watch all your communication, to listen to your online discus@@ sions, to collect your pass@@ words.
Now when we think deeper about things like these, the obvious response from people should be that, "Okay, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citiz@@ en.
Why should I worr@@ y?
Because I have nothing to h@@ ide@@ ."
And this is an argument@@ , which doesn't make sense.
Pri@@ vac@@ y is im@@ pli@@ ed.
Pri@@ vac@@ y is not up for discussion.
This is not a question between privacy against security.
It's a question of freedom against control.
And while we might trust our governments right now, right here in 2011, any right we give away will be given away for good.
And do we trust, do we blind@@ ly trust, any future government, a government we might have 50 years from now?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In the Ma@@ as@@ ai community where Richard Tur@@ ere lives with his family, cat@@ tle are all-@@ important. But lion attacks were growing more frequ@@ ent. In this short, inspiring talk, the young inventor shares the solar-@@ powered solution he designed to safely s@@ care the lions away.
Richard Tur@@ er@@ e: My invention that made peace with li@@ ons.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, at the south parts of the Nairob@@ i National Park.
Those are my dad@@ 's cows at the back, and behind the co@@ ws, that's the Nairob@@ i National Park.
Nairob@@ i National Park is not f@@ enced in the south wid@@ ely, which means wild animals like z@@ ebr@@ as migrate out of the park fre@@ ely.
So predat@@ ors like lions follow them, and this is what they do.
They kill our livest@@ oc@@ k.
This is one of the cows which was killed at night, and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead, and I felt so bad, because it was the only bul@@ l we had.
My community, the Ma@@ as@@ ai, we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them, and that's why we value them so much.
So I grew up h@@ ating lions so much.
The mor@@ ans are the warri@@ ors who protect our community and the livest@@ oc@@ k, and they're also upset about this problem.
So they kill the li@@ ons.
It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairob@@ i.
And I think this is why the Nairob@@ i National Park lions are fe@@ w.
So a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community is responsible for his dad@@ 's co@@ ws, and that's the same thing which happened to me.
So I had to find a way of solving this problem.
And the first idea I got was to use fire, because I thought lions were scared of fire.
But I came to realize that that didn't really help, because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed.
So I didn't give up. I continu@@ ed.
And a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row.
I was trying to trick the lions [@@ into think@@ ing@@ ] that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed.
But lions are very cle@@ ver. They will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row, and they go back, but the second day, they'll come and they say, this thing is not moving here, it's always here. So he jum@@ ps in and kills the animals.
So one night, I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a tor@@ ch, and that day, the lions didn't come.
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light.
So I had an idea.
Since I was a small boy, I used to work in my room for the whole day, and I even took apart my mom@@ 's new radio, and that day she almost killed me, but I learned a lot about electron@@ ics. So I got an old car batter@@ y, an indic@@ ator box. It's a small device found in a motor@@ cycle, and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left. It blin@@ ks.
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off.
And that's a small tor@@ ch from a broken flash@@ light.
So I set up everything.
As you can see, the solar panel charges the batter@@ y, and the battery supplies the power to the small indic@@ ator box. I call it a transfor@@ mer.
And the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash@@ .
As you can see, the bul@@ bs face outside, because that's where the lions come from.
And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night.
The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed, but I was sleeping in my bed.
Thanks.
So I set it up in my home two years ago, and since then, we have never experienced any problem with li@@ ons.
And my neighbor@@ ing homes heard about this idea.
One of them was this grand@@ mother.
She had a lot of her animals being killed by li@@ ons, and she asked me if I could put the lights for her.
And I said, "Yes."
So I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights.
Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community, and they're really working.
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other predat@@ ors like hy@@ enas, leopar@@ ds, and it's also being used to s@@ care elephants away from people's far@@ ms.
Because of this inven@@ tion, I was lucky to get a scholar@@ ship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brook@@ house International School, and I'm really excited about this.
My new school now is coming in and helping by fund@@ raising and creating an awar@@ eness.
I even took my friends back to my community, and we're inst@@ alling the lights to the homes which don't have [@@ any@@ ], and I'm teaching them how to put them.
So one year ago, I was just a boy in the sav@@ anna grass@@ land her@@ ding my father's co@@ ws, and I used to see planes flying over, and I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside.
And here I am today.
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED.
So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate li@@ ons, but now because my invention is saving my father's cows and the li@@ ons, we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict.
Ash@@ ê ol@@ ên@@ . It means in my language, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like your@@ s.
So you got this scholar@@ ship@@ .@@ Richard Tur@@ er@@ e: Y@@ ep.
CA: You're working on other electrical inven@@ tions.
What's the next one on your list@@ ?
R@@ T: My next invention is, I want to make an electric f@@ ence@@ .@@ CA: Elec@@ tric f@@ ence?
R@@ T: But I know electric f@@ ences are already inv@@ ented, but I want to make mine.
CA: You already tried it once, right, and you -@@ R@@ T: I tried it before, but I stopped because it gave me a shoc@@ k. CA: In the tr@@ ench@@ es. Richard Tur@@ er@@ e, you are something else.
We're going to che@@ er you on every step of the way, my friend.
Thank you so much@@ .@@ R@@ T: Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As a child growing up in North Korea, H@@ ye@@ on@@ se@@ o Lee thought her country was “@@ the best on the planet@@ .” It wasn't until the fam@@ ine of the 90@@ s that she began to won@@ der. She esca@@ ped the country at 14, to begin a life in hid@@ ing, as a refugee in China. H@@ ers is a har@@ ro@@ w@@ ing, personal tale of survival and hope - and a powerful remin@@ der of those who face constant dang@@ er, even when the border is far behind.
H@@ ye@@ on@@ se@@ o Le@@ e: My escape from North Kore@@ a.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "@@ Nothing To En@@ v@@ y."
And I was very prou@@ d.
In school, we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim I@@ l-@@ Sun@@ g, but we never learned much about the outside world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enem@@ ies.
Although I often wondered about the outside world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything suddenly changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execu@@ tion.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor, and myself, I had never experienced hun@@ ger.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from a co@@ work@@ er's sis@@ ter.
It read, "When you read this, our five family members will not exist in this world, because we haven't eaten for the past three weeks.
We are lying on the floor together, and our bodies are so wea@@ k, we are waiting to di@@ e."
I was so shock@@ ed.
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering.
So@@ on after, when I was walking past a train station, I saw something terrible that to this day I can't er@@ ase from my memory.
A lif@@ eless woman was lying on the ground, while an ema@@ ci@@ ated child in her arms just star@@ ed helpl@@ essly at his mother's face.
But nobody helped them, because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge fam@@ ine hit North Korea in the mid-@@ 199@@ 0s.
Ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely, more than a million North Kore@@ ans died during the fam@@ ine, and many only survived by eating gras@@ s, bu@@ gs and tree bar@@ k.
Po@@ wer out@@ ages also became more and more frequ@@ ent, so everything around me was completely dark at night, except for the sea of lights in China, just across the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had lights, but we didn't.
This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night, compared to neighbor@@ s.
This is the Am@@ no@@ k Ri@@ ver, which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very narrow at certain points, allowing North Kore@@ ans to secre@@ tly cros@@ s.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the river.
I can't reveal many details about how I left North Korea, but I only can say that during the ugly years of the fam@@ ine, I was sent to China to live with distant relativ@@ es.
But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time.
I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard living as a young girl without my family.
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refuge@@ e.
But I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult, it's also very dangerous, since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migr@@ ants.
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be reve@@ al@@ ed, and I would be re@@ patri@@ ated to a horrible fa@@ te, back in North Kore@@ a.
One day, my worst night@@ m@@ are came true, when I was caught by the Chinese police, and brought to the police station for interrog@@ ation.
Someone had ac@@ cu@@ sed me of being North Kore@@ an, so they tested my Chinese language abil@@ ities, and asked me tons of questions.
I was so scar@@ ed.
I thought my heart was going to explo@@ de.
If anything seemed un@@ natural, I could be imprison@@ ed and re@@ patri@@ ated.
I thought my life was over.
But I managed to control all the emotions inside me, and answer the questions.
After they finished questioning me, one official said to another, "This was a false report@@ . She's not North Kore@@ an."
And they let me go. It was a mirac@@ le.
Some North Kore@@ ans in China seek as@@ yl@@ um in foreign em@@ bas@@ si@@ es.
But many can be caught by the Chinese police, and re@@ patri@@ ated.
These girls were so lucky.
Even though they were cau@@ gh@@ t, they were eventually releas@@ ed, after heavy international press@@ ure.
These North Kore@@ ans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Kore@@ ans are caught in China and re@@ patri@@ ated to North Korea, where they can be tor@@ ture@@ d, imprison@@ ed, or publicly execu@@ ted.
Even though I was really fortunate to get out, many other North Kore@@ ans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Kore@@ ans have to hide their identi@@ ties and struggle so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and getting a job, their whole world can be turned upside down in an inst@@ ant.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk going to South Kore@@ a.
And I started a new life yet again.
S@@ et@@ t@@ ling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected.
English was so important in South Korea, so I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I realized there was a wide gap between North and Sou@@ th.
We are all Kore@@ an, but inside, we have become very different, due to 6@@ 7 years of divis@@ ion.
I even went through an identity crisis.
Am I South Korean or North Kore@@ an?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Sudden@@ ly, there was no country I could prou@@ dly call my own.
Even though adjus@@ ting to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan - I started studying for the university entr@@ ance ex@@ am.
Just as I was starting to get used to my new life, I received a shocking phone call.
The North Korean authorities inter@@ cep@@ ted some money that I sent to my family, and, as a punish@@ ment, my family was going to be for@@ ci@@ bly removed to a desol@@ ate location in the countr@@ ys@@ ide.
They had to get out quickly.
So I started planning how to help them esca@@ pe.
North Kore@@ ans have to travel incredible dist@@ ances on the path to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Kore@@ a.
So, iron@@ ically, I took a flight back to China and headed toward the North Korean bord@@ er.
Since my family couldn't speak Chin@@ ese, I had to guide them somehow through more than 2,000 miles in China, and then into Sou@@ theast Asia.
The journey by bus took one week, and we were almost caught several times.
One time, our bus was stopped and boar@@ ded by a Chinese police offic@@ er.
He took everyone's I.@@ D. cards, and he started asking them questions.
Since my family couldn't understand Chin@@ ese, I thought my family was going to be arres@@ ted.
As the Chinese officer approached my family, I impul@@ si@@ vely stood up, and I told him that these are dea@@ f and dumb people that I was ch@@ aper@@ on@@ ing.
He looked at me suspic@@ i@@ ously, but luckily, he believed me.
We made it all the way to the border of La@@ os.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bri@@ be the border guards in La@@ os.
But even after we got past the bord@@ er, my family was arrested and j@@ ai@@ led for illegal border cross@@ ing.
After I paid the fine and bri@@ be, my family was released in one month.
But soon after, my family was arrested and j@@ ai@@ led again, in the capital of La@@ os.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to get my family to freedom, and we came so close, but my family was thrown in jail@@ , just a short distance from the South Korean emb@@ ass@@ y.
I went back and forth between the immigr@@ ation office and the police station, desperately trying to get my family out.
But I didn't have enough money to pay a bri@@ be or fine anymore.
I lost all hope.
At that moment, I heard one man's voice ask me, "What's wrong@@ ?"
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask.
In my broken English, and with a diction@@ ary, I explained the situation, and without hesit@@ ating, the man went to the AT@@ M, and he paid the rest of the money for my family, and two other North Kore@@ ans to get out of jail.
I than@@ ked him with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why are you helping me?"
"I'm not helping you@@ ," he said.
"I'm helping the North Korean people@@ ."
I realized that this was a symbol@@ ic moment in my life.
The kind stranger symbol@@ ized new hope for me and the North Korean people, when we needed it most.
And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need.
Eventu@@ ally, after our long journey, my family and I were reuni@@ ted in South Kore@@ a.
But getting to freedom is only half the batt@@ le.
Many North Kore@@ ans are separated from their families, and when they arrive in a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community for education, English language training, job training, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world.
Because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside.
I've been so lucky, received so much help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help give aspir@@ ing North Kore@@ ans a chance to pros@@ per with international support.
I'm confident that you will see more and more North Kore@@ ans succe@@ eding all over the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Ron Fin@@ ley plants veget@@ able gar@@ d@@ ens in South Central L@@ A - in abandoned lo@@ ts, traffic medi@@ ans, along the cur@@ bs. Why? For fun, for de@@ fi@@ ance, for beauty and to offer some alternative to fast food in a community where "the dri@@ ve-@@ thr@@ us are killing more people than the dri@@ ve-@@ b@@ ys@@ ."
Ron Fin@@ ley: A guer@@ illa garden@@ er in South Central L@@ A.
I live in South Centr@@ al.
This is South Centr@@ al: liqu@@ or stor@@ es, fast food, vac@@ ant lo@@ ts.
So the city plan@@ ners, they get together and they figure they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else, so they change it to South Los Angeles, like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles. Li@@ qu@@ or stor@@ es, fast food, vac@@ ant lo@@ ts.
Just like 26@@ .@@ 5 million other Americans, I live in a food deser@@ t, South Central Los Angeles, home of the dri@@ ve-@@ thr@@ u and the dri@@ ve-@@ by.
Fun@@ ny thing is, the dri@@ ve-@@ thr@@ us are killing more people than the dri@@ ve-@@ by@@ s.
People are dying from cur@@ able diseases in South Central Los Angeles.
For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher th@@ an, say, Bever@@ ly Hill@@ s, which is probably eight, 10 miles away.
I got tired of seeing this happening.
And I was wondering, how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food, if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborho@@ od@@ ?
I see wheel@@ chairs bought and sold like used cars.
I see dial@@ ys@@ is centers po@@ pping up like Star@@ buc@@ ks.
And I fig@@ ured, this has to stop.
So I figured that the problem is the solution.
Fo@@ od is the problem and food is the solution.
Pl@@ us I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn't im@@ pregn@@ ated with pestic@@ ides.
So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house.
It was on a strip of land that we call a par@@ k@@ way.
It's 150 feet by 10 feet.
Th@@ ing is, it's owned by the city.
But you have to maintain it.
So I'm like, "@@ Co@@ ol. I can do whatever the hell I want, since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it."
And this is how I decided to maintain it.
So me and my group, L.A. Green Gr@@ ounds, we got together and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees, you know, the whole nine, veget@@ ables.
What we do, we're a pa@@ y-@@ it-@@ forward kind of group, where it's composed of garden@@ ers from all walks of life, from all over the city, and it's completely volunte@@ er, and everything we do is free.
And the gar@@ den, it was beautiful.
And then somebody complain@@ ed.
The city came down on me, and basically gave me a cit@@ ation saying that I had to remove my gar@@ den, which this cit@@ ation was turning into a war@@ r@@ ant.
And I'm like, "Come on, real@@ ly?
A war@@ r@@ ant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about@@ ?" And I was like, "@@ Co@@ ol. Br@@ ing it."
Because this time it wasn't coming up.
So L.A. Times got ah@@ old of it. Steve L@@ ope@@ z did a story on it and talked to the coun@@ cil@@ man, and one of the Green Gr@@ ounds member@@ s, they put up a peti@@ tion on Chan@@ ge@@ .org@@ , and with 900 sig@@ natur@@ es, we were a success.
We had a vic@@ tory on our hands.
My coun@@ cil@@ man even called in and said how they end@@ or@@ se and love what we're doing.
I mean, come on, why wouldn't they@@ ?
L.A. leads the United States in vac@@ ant lots that the city actually own@@ s.
They own 26 square miles of vac@@ ant lo@@ ts.
That's 20 Central Par@@ ks.
That's enough space to plant 7@@ 25 million toma@@ to plants.
Why in the hell would they not okay this?
Gro@@ wing one plant will give you 1,@@ 00@@ 0, 10,000 se@@ eds.
When one dollar@@ 's worth of green be@@ ans will give you 75 dollar@@ s' worth of produce.
It's my gos@@ pel@@ , when I'm telling people, grow your own food.
Gro@@ wing your own food is like printing your own money.
See, I have a legacy in South Centr@@ al.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I refuse to be a part of this manufac@@ tured reality that was manufac@@ tured for me by some other people, and I'm manufacturing my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
Gar@@ den@@ ing is my graf@@ fi@@ ti. I grow my art.
Just like a graf@@ fit@@ i artist, where they beauti@@ fy walls, me, I beauti@@ fy la@@ wn@@ s, par@@ k@@ ways.
I use the gar@@ den, the soil, like it's a piece of clo@@ th, and the plants and the trees, that's my emb@@ ell@@ ish@@ ment for that clo@@ th.
You'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your can@@ vas.
You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sun@@ flower is and how it affects people.
So what happened?
I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education, a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the soil.
You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this.
Gar@@ den@@ ing is the most ther@@ ape@@ u@@ tic and de@@ fi@@ ant act you can do, especially in the inner city.
Pl@@ us you get str@@ aw@@ ber@@ ri@@ es.
I remember this time, there was this mother and a daughter came, it was, like, 10@@ :@@ 30 at night, and they were in my yar@@ d, and I came out and they looked so ash@@ am@@ ed.
So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there, and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
It made me feel ash@@ amed to see people that were this close to me that were hungr@@ y, and this only rein@@ forced why I do this, and people asked me, "F@@ in, aren't you afraid people are going to steal your food@@ ?"
And I'm like, "H@@ ell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it.
That's why it's on the street.
That's the whole idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take back their health@@ ."
There's another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles.
These are the guys, they helped me un@@ load the truc@@ k.
It was cool, and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grand@@ mother, and it was just cool to see how this changed them, if it was only for that one moment.
So Green Gr@@ ounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 garden@@ s.
We've had, like, 50 people come to our dig@@ -@@ ins and participa@@ te, and it's all volunte@@ ers.
If kids grow k@@ al@@ e, kids eat k@@ al@@ e.
If they grow toma@@ to@@ es, they eat toma@@ to@@ es. But when none of this is presented to them, if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body, they blind@@ ly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them.
I see young people and they want to work, but they're in this thing where they're caught up - I see kids of color and they're just on this track that's designed for them, that leads them to nowhere.
So with garden@@ ing, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities, to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who know@@ s?
We might produce the next George Washington Car@@ ver.
But if we don't change the composition of the soil, we will never do this.
Now this is one of my plan@@ s. This is what I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gar@@ d@@ ens where people can share in the food in the same bloc@@ k.
I want to take shipping contain@@ ers and turn them into healthy caf@@ es.
Now don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about no free sh@@ it, because free is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustain@@ ability, you have to sustain it.
What I'm talking about is putting people to work, and getting kids off the street, and letting them know the jo@@ y, the pride and the honor in growing your own food, opening far@@ mer@@ 's markets.
So what I want to do here, we gotta make this sex@@ y.
So I want us all to become eco@@ lu@@ tionary ren@@ eg@@ ades, gang@@ st@@ as, gang@@ st@@ a garden@@ ers.
We gotta flip the script on what a gang@@ st@@ a is.
If you ain't a garden@@ er, you ain't gang@@ st@@ a.
Get gang@@ st@@ a with your sho@@ vel, okay?
And let that be your weapon of choice.
So basically, if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to me@@ et, don't call me if you want to sit around in cus@@ h@@ y chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some sh@@ it - where you talk about doing some sh@@ it.
If you want to meet with me, come to the garden with your sho@@ vel so we can plant some sh@@ it.
Pe@@ ac@@ e. Thank you.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: P@@ av@@ ed roads are nice to look at, but they're easily dam@@ aged and cost@@ ly to re@@ pa@@ ir. Erik Sch@@ l@@ ang@@ en demos a new type of por@@ ous as@@ phal@@ t made of simple materials with an astonishing feature@@ : When crack@@ ed, it can be "@@ heal@@ ed@@ " by induc@@ tion he@@ ating.
Erik Sch@@ l@@ ang@@ en: A "@@ self-@@ heal@@ ing" as@@ phal@@ t.
You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of as@@ phal@@ t, and as@@ phal@@ t is a very nice material to drive on, but not always, especially not on these days as today, when it's rain@@ ing a lot.
Then you can have a lot of s@@ plas@@ h water in the as@@ phal@@ t.
And especially if you then ride with your bicy@@ cle, and pass these cars, then that's not very nice.
Also, as@@ phal@@ t can create a lot of noise.
It's a nois@@ y material, and if we produce roads like in the Nether@@ lands, very close to cities, then we would like a silent road.
The solution for that is to make roads out of por@@ ous as@@ phal@@ t.
Por@@ ous as@@ phal@@ t, a material that we use now in most of the high@@ ways in the Nether@@ lands, it has por@@ es and water can just rain through it, so all the rain@@ water will flow away to the sid@@ es, and you have a road that's easy to drive on, so no s@@ plas@@ h water anymore.
Also the noise will disappear in these por@@ es.
Because it's very hol@@ low, all the noise will disappe@@ ar, so it's a very silent road.
It also has dis@@ advant@@ ages, of course, and the dis@@ advantage of this road is that r@@ avel@@ ing can occur@@ .
What is r@@ avel@@ ing? You see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off.
First you get one stone, then several more, and more and more and more and more, and then they - well, I will not do that. But they can damage your wind@@ shi@@ el@@ d, so you're not happy with that.
And finally, this r@@ avel@@ ing can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create po@@ th@@ ol@@ es with that.
H@@ a. He's ready.
Po@@ th@@ ol@@ es, of course, that can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material.
It's a por@@ ous as@@ phal@@ t, like I said, so you have only a small amount of b@@ ind@@ er between the st@@ ones.
Du@@ e to wea@@ ther@@ ing, due to U.@@ V. light, due to oxid@@ ation, this b@@ ind@@ er, this bit@@ um@@ en, the glu@@ e between the aggreg@@ ates is going to shrin@@ k, and if it shrin@@ ks, it gets micro-@@ crack@@ s, and it del@@ am@@ in@@ ates from the aggreg@@ ates.
Then if you drive over the road, you take out the aggreg@@ ates - what we just saw here.
To solve this problem, we thought of self-@@ healing materials.
If we can make this material self-@@ heal@@ ing, then probably we have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wo@@ ol just to clean pan@@ s, and the steel wo@@ ol we can cut in very small pieces, and these very small pieces we can mix to the bit@@ um@@ en.
So then you have as@@ phal@@ t with very small pieces of steel wo@@ ol in it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you can use for cooking - an induc@@ tion machine.
Ind@@ uc@@ tion can heat, especially ste@@ el@@ ; it's very good at that.
Then what you do is you heat up the ste@@ el, you melt the bit@@ um@@ en, and the bit@@ um@@ en will flow into these micro-@@ crack@@ s, and the stones are again fixed to the surface.
Today I use a micro@@ wave because I cannot take the big induc@@ tion machine here on@@ stage.
So a micro@@ wave is a similar system.
So I put the speci@@ men in, which I'm now going to take out to see what happened.
So this is the speci@@ men coming out now.
So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the speci@@ men@@ s.
We tested a lot of speci@@ mens there, and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that."
So they don@@ ated to us a piece of high@@ way, 400 meters of the A@@ 5@@ 8, where we had to make a test track to test this material.
So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road, and then of course this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know from practice.
So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
So we did aging on the sam@@ ples, did a lot of lo@@ ading on it, heal@@ ed them with our induc@@ tion machine, and heal@@ ed them and tested them again.
Sever@@ al times we can repeat that.
So actually, the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine - this is the big version we have made to go on the real road - if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road, which of course sav@@ es a lot of money.
Well, to conclu@@ de, I can say that we made a material using steel fi@@ bers, the addition of steel fi@@ bers, using induc@@ tion energy to really increase the surface life of the road, double the surface life you can even do, so it will really save a lot of money with very simple trick@@ s.
And now you're of course curious if it also worked.
So we still have the speci@@ men here. It's quite war@@ m.
Actually, it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the healing works.
But I will do a trial.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Imagine a country where girls must sne@@ ak out to go to school, with deadly consequences if they get caught learning. This was Afghanistan under the Taliban@@ , and traces of that danger remain today. 2@@ 2@@ -year-old Sh@@ ab@@ ana Bas@@ ij@@ -@@ R@@ as@@ ik@@ h runs a school for girls in Afghanistan. She celebr@@ ates the power of a family's decision to believe in their daughters - and tells the story of one brave father who stood up to local thre@@ ats.
Sh@@ ab@@ ana Bas@@ ij@@ -@@ R@@ as@@ ik@@ h: D@@ are to educate Afghan girls.
When I was 11, I remember wa@@ king up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.
My father was listening to B@@ BC News on his small, gray radi@@ o.
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then, because the news mostly depressed him.
"The Taliban are gon@@ e@@ !" my father sh@@ ou@@ ted.
I didn't know what it me@@ ant, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school now@@ ," he said.
A morning that I will never for@@ get.
A real school.
You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy to escor@@ t my older sis@@ ter, who was no longer allowed to be outside alone, to a secret school.
It was the only way we both could be educa@@ ted.
Each day, we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going.
We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopp@@ ing.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.
It was coz@@ y in winter but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives - the teacher, the students and our parents.
From time to time, the school would suddenly be cancel@@ ed for a week because Taliban were suspic@@ i@@ ous.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
W@@ ere we being follow@@ ed?
Do they know where we li@@ ve?
We were scar@@ ed, but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was pr@@ ized and daughters were treas@@ ure@@ d.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total maver@@ ick from a remote prov@@ ince of Afghanistan, he insis@@ ted that his daughter, my mom, go to school, and for that he was dis@@ owned by his father.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
There she is.
She reti@@ red two years ago, only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father - that's him - he was the first ever in his family to receive an education.
There was no question that his children would receive an education, including his daugh@@ ters, despite the Taliban@@ , despite the ris@@ ks.
To him, there was greater risk in not educ@@ ating his children.
During Taliban years, I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future.
I would want to qu@@ it, but my father, he would say, "L@@ isten, my daughter, you can lose everything you own in your life.
Your money can be st@@ ol@@ en. You can be forced to leave your home during a war.
But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fe@@ es, we will.
So do you still not want to continu@@ e?"
Today I am 2@@ 2.
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Fe@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school, and had my family not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Mid@@ d@@ le@@ bury Col@@ leg@@ e.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grand@@ father, the one ex@@ iled from his home for dar@@ ing to educate his daugh@@ ters, was among the first to congr@@ atul@@ ate me.
He not only br@@ ag@@ s about my college degre@@ e, but also that I was the first woman, and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kab@@ ul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.
That's why I am a global amb@@ ass@@ ador for 10@@ x@@ 10, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cof@@ ounded S@@ OL@@ A, the first and perhaps only boar@@ ding school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambi@@ tion grab@@ bing at opportunity.
And I see their parents and their fathers who, like my own, advocate for them, despite and even in the face of da@@ un@@ ting op@@ position.
Like Ah@@ med. That's not his real name, and I cannot show you his face, but Ah@@ med is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were on their way from S@@ OL@@ A to their village, and they literally missed being killed by a road@@ side bomb by minutes.
As he arrived home, the phone rang@@ , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again.
"K@@ ill me now, if you wish@@ ," he said, "@@ but I will not ru@@ in my daugh@@ ter's future because of your old and back@@ ward ide@@ as."
What I've come to realize about Afghanistan, and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West, that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success.
It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.
In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their daugh@@ ters, but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan, we must have the support of men.
Under the Taliban@@ , girls who went to school number@@ ed in the hundreds - remember, it was il@@ legal.
But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragil@@ ity in changes.
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. tro@@ op@@ s' with@@ draw@@ al.
But when I am back in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and las@@ ting change.
To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and bound@@ less possibil@@ ities, and every single day the girls of S@@ OL@@ A remind me of that.
Like me, they are dream@@ ing big.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In Lib@@ y@@ a, Z@@ ah@@ ra@@ ' L@@ angh@@ i was part of the "@@ days of r@@ ag@@ e" movement that helped top@@ ple the dict@@ ator G@@ add@@ afi@@ . But - then what? In their first elec@@ tions, Lib@@ y@@ ans tried an innovative sl@@ ate of candid@@ ates, the "@@ z@@ ip@@ per bal@@ lot@@ ," that en@@ sured equal representation from men and women of both sid@@ es. Yet the same gr@@ id@@ locked politics of domin@@ ance and exclus@@ ion won out. What Lib@@ ya needs now, L@@ angh@@ i suggest@@ s, is collabor@@ ation, not competi@@ tion; compassion, not r@@ age.
Z@@ ah@@ ra@@ ' L@@ angh@@ i: Why Lib@@ y@@ a's revolution didn't work - and what m@@ ight.
I have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her ex@@ ile@@ : "S@@ on, resist G@@ add@@ afi@@ . F@@ ight him.
But don't you ever turn into a G@@ add@@ afi@@ -like revolution@@ ar@@ y."
Almost two years have passed since the Lib@@ y@@ an Revolution broke out, inspired by the waves of mass mobil@@ ization in both the Tunis@@ ian and the Egyptian revolu@@ tions.
I joined forces with many other Lib@@ y@@ ans inside and outside Lib@@ ya to call for a day of r@@ age and to initi@@ ate a revolution against the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ ical regime of G@@ add@@ afi@@ .
And there it was, a great revolution.
Young Lib@@ y@@ an women and men were at the fore@@ front calling for the fall of the regi@@ me, raising slogan@@ s of freedom, dign@@ ity, social justice.
They have shown an exempl@@ ary br@@ aver@@ y in confron@@ ting the brutal dict@@ ator@@ ship of G@@ add@@ afi@@ .
They have shown a great sense of solid@@ ar@@ ity from the far east to the far west to the sou@@ th.
Eventu@@ ally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a tol@@ l rate of almost 50,000 dead, we managed to liber@@ ate our country and to top@@ ple the ty@@ r@@ ant.
However, G@@ add@@ af@@ i left behind a heavy bur@@ den, a legacy of ty@@ ran@@ n@@ y, corruption and seeds of diver@@ sions.
For four decades G@@ add@@ afi@@ 's ty@@ ran@@ n@@ ical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Lib@@ y@@ an society.
A@@ ware of the devast@@ ation and the challenges, I was ke@@ en among many other women to rebuild the Lib@@ y@@ an civil society, calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconcili@@ ation.
Almost 200 organizations were established in Ben@@ gh@@ az@@ i during and immediately after the fall of G@@ add@@ af@@ i - almost 300 in Tri@@ pol@@ i.
After a period of 33 years in exi@@ le, I went back to Lib@@ y@@ a, and with unique enthusias@@ m, I started organizing worksho@@ ps on capacity building, on human development of leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, I co-@@ founded the Lib@@ y@@ an Wo@@ men's Plat@@ form for Pe@@ ace, a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life, to lobby for the soci@@ opol@@ i@@ tical empower@@ ment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace.
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-@@ elec@@ tions, an environment which was increasingly polariz@@ ed, an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of domin@@ ance and exclus@@ ion.
I led an initiative by the Lib@@ y@@ an Wo@@ men's Plat@@ form for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive elec@@ tor@@ al law, a law that would give every citiz@@ en, no matter what your background, the right to vote and run, and most importantly to sti@@ pul@@ ate on political parties the altern@@ ation of male and female candid@@ ates ver@@ tically and horiz@@ ont@@ ally in their list@@ s, creating the z@@ ip@@ per list.
Eventu@@ ally, our initiative was adopted and successful.
Women won 17@@ .@@ 5 percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in 52 years.
However, bit by bit, the e@@ up@@ hor@@ ia of the elec@@ tions, and of the revolution as a whole, was f@@ ading out - for every day we were wa@@ king up to the news of violence.
One day we wake up to the news of the des@@ ec@@ r@@ ation of ancient mos@@ ques and Su@@ fi to@@ mb@@ s.
On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American amb@@ ass@@ ador and the attack on the consul@@ ate.
On another day we wake up to the news of the assassin@@ ation of army offic@@ ers.
And every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the mil@@ iti@@ as and their continuous viol@@ ations of human rights of prisoners and their dis@@ respect of the rule of law.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mind@@ set, became more polar@@ ized and has driven away from the ide@@ als and the principles - freedom, dign@@ ity, social justice - that we first hel@@ d.
In@@ toler@@ ance, exclus@@ ion and re@@ ven@@ ge became the icon@@ s of the [@@ after@@ ma@@ th@@ ] of the revolution.
I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the z@@ ip@@ per list and the elec@@ tions.
I'm rather here today to conf@@ ess that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision.
We did not prioriti@@ ze right.
For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Lib@@ y@@ a.
Did the z@@ ip@@ per list and the altern@@ ation between female and male candid@@ ates bring peace and national reconcili@@ ation?
No, it didn't.
What is it, then?
Why does our society continue to be polar@@ ized and dominated with selfish politics of domin@@ ance and exclus@@ ion, by both men and women@@ ?
Maybe what was missing was not the women only, but the femin@@ ine values of compassion, merc@@ y and inclus@@ ion.
Our society needs national dialogue and consen@@ sus@@ -@@ building more than it needed the elec@@ tions, which only rein@@ forced polariz@@ ation and divis@@ ion.
Our society needs the qualit@@ ative representation of the femin@@ ine more than it needs the numer@@ ical, quantit@@ ative representation of the femin@@ ine.
We need to stop acting as agents of r@@ age and calling for days of r@@ age.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and merc@@ y.
We need to develop a femin@@ ine dis@@ course that not only hon@@ ors but also imple@@ ments merc@@ y instead of re@@ ven@@ ge, collaboration instead of competition, inclus@@ ion instead of exclus@@ ion.
These are the ide@@ als that a war@@ -@@ tor@@ n Lib@@ ya needs desperately in order to achieve peace.
For peace has an al@@ chem@@ y, and this al@@ chem@@ y is about the inter@@ tw@@ in@@ ing, the altern@@ ation between the femin@@ ine and mascul@@ ine perspec@@ tiv@@ es.
That's the real z@@ ip@@ per.
And we need to establish that exist@@ entially before we do so soci@@ opol@@ i@@ tically.
According to a Q@@ ur@@ an@@ ic ver@@ se "S@@ al@@ am@@ " - peace - "@@ is the word of the all-@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful God, ra@@ he@@ em."
In turn, the word "@@ ra@@ he@@ em@@ ," which is known in all Abrah@@ am@@ ic tradi@@ tions, has the same root in Arabic as the word "@@ ra@@ hem@@ " - w@@ om@@ b - symbol@@ izing the matern@@ al femin@@ ine en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing all humanity from which the male and the femal@@ e, from which all trib@@ es, all peo@@ ples, have eman@@ ated from.
And so just as the w@@ om@@ b entirely envel@@ op@@ es the embr@@ y@@ o, which grows within it, the div@@ ine matrix of compassion n@@ our@@ ishes the entire existence.
Th@@ us we are told that "My merc@@ y en@@ comp@@ asses all thing@@ s."
Th@@ us we are told that "My merc@@ y takes preced@@ ence over my ang@@ er."
May we all be granted a gr@@ ace of merc@@ y.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Les@@ lie M@@ organ Ste@@ in@@ er was in "@@ crazy lo@@ ve" - that is, mad@@ ly in love with a man who routinely ab@@ used her and threatened her life. Ste@@ in@@ er tells the story of her relationship, correc@@ ting mis@@ concep@@ tions many people hold about victims of domestic violence, and explaining how we can all help break the silence.
Les@@ lie M@@ organ Ste@@ in@@ er: Why domestic violence victims don't leav@@ e.
I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question, which has an equally disturbing answer.
My topic is the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to tackle is the one question everyone always ask@@ s: Why does she st@@ ay?
Why would anyone stay with a man who be@@ ats her@@ ?
I'm not a psychiatr@@ ist, a social worker or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just one woman with a story to tel@@ l.
I was 2@@ 2. I had just graduated from Harvard Col@@ leg@@ e.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Sev@@ ente@@ en magaz@@ ine.
I had my first apart@@ ment, my first little green American Ex@@ press card, and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hol@@ low-@@ point bul@@ lets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soul@@ mate, many, many times.
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remem@@ ber.
I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love, a psychological tra@@ p dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as love, one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year.
It may even be your story.
I don't look like a typical domestic violence surviv@@ or.
I have a B.@@ A. in English from Harvard Col@@ leg@@ e, an MB@@ A in marketing from Wh@@ ar@@ ton Business Scho@@ ol.
I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies including Johnson &amp; John@@ son, Le@@ o Bur@@ nett and The Washington Pos@@ t.
I've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together.
My dog is a black lab, and I drive a H@@ onda O@@ dys@@ se@@ y min@@ iv@@ an.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone - all rac@@ es, all religi@@ ons, all income and education levels.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women, that it's a women's issue.
Not exac@@ tly.
Over 85 percent of ab@@ users are men, and domestic abuse happens only in inti@@ mate, interdepend@@ ent, long-term relationships, in other words, in families, the last place we would want or expect to find violence, which is one reason domestic abuse is so confus@@ ing.
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who be@@ ats me, but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 2@@ 2, and in the United States, women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages, and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abus@@ ive part@@ ners, boy@@ friends, and husb@@ ands in the United States.
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns.
I met Con@@ or on a cold, rain@@ y January night.
He sat next to me on the New York City sub@@ way, and he started chat@@ ting me up.
He told me two things.
One was that h@@ e, too, had just graduated from an I@@ vy Le@@ ague school, and that he worked at a very impress@@ ive Wall Street bank.
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy.
He had these big chee@@ ks, these big apple chee@@ ks and this whe@@ at@@ -@@ b@@ lon@@ d hair, and he seemed so swe@@ et.
One of the smar@@ test things Con@@ or did, from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship.
He did this especially at the beginning by id@@ ol@@ izing me.
We started dat@@ ing, and he loved everything about me, that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard, that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job.
He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams.
Con@@ or believed in me, as a writer and a woman, in a way that no one else ever had.
And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by conf@@ essing his secre@@ t, which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four, he had been sav@@ ag@@ ely and repeate@@ dly physically ab@@ used by his ste@@ p@@ father, and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade, even though he was very smart, and he'd spent almost 20 years re@@ building his life.
Which is why that I@@ vy Le@@ ague degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shin@@ y future meant so much to him.
If you had told me that this smart, funny, sensitive man who ador@@ ed me would one day dict@@ ate whether or not I wore make@@ up, how short my skir@@ ts were, where I li@@ ved, what jobs I to@@ ok, who my friends were and where I spent Christ@@ mas, I would have laugh@@ ed at you, because there was not a hin@@ t of violence or control or anger in Con@@ or at the beginning.
I didn't know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to se@@ du@@ ce and char@@ m the victim@@ .
I also didn't know that the second step is to isol@@ ate the victim@@ .
Now, Con@@ or did not come home one day and ann@@ oun@@ ce, "You know, hey, all this Ro@@ me@@ o and Juli@@ et stuff has been great, but I need to move into the next phase where I isol@@ ate you and I abuse you@@ " — — "@@ so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scre@@ am and out of this city where you have friends and family and co@@ workers who can see the bru@@ is@@ es."
Instead, Con@@ or came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day, his dream job, and he said that he had quit his job because of me, because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore, and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abus@@ ive, dys@@ functional family.
And move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York, and my dream job, but I thought you made sacrific@@ es for your soul@@ mate, so I agre@@ ed, and I quit my job, and Con@@ or and I left Manhattan together.
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love, that I was walking head@@ first into a carefully laid physic@@ al, financial and psychological trap@@ .
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reac@@ ts.
And here's where those guns come in.
As soon as we moved to New England - you know, that place where Con@@ nor was supposed to feel so safe - he bought three guns.
He kept one in the g@@ love com@@ partment of our car.
He kept one under the pil@@ lows on our bed, and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times.
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy.
He needed them to feel protec@@ ted.
But those guns were really a message for me, and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me, my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day.
Con@@ or first physically attacked me five days before our wed@@ ding.
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my night@@ go@@ wn.
I was working on my computer trying to finish a fre@@ el@@ ance writing assign@@ ment, and I got frustr@@ ated, and Con@@ or used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squee@@ ze so tightly that I could not breathe or scre@@ am, and he used the cho@@ ke@@ hold to hit my head repeate@@ dly against the wall.
Five days later, the ten bru@@ is@@ es on my neck had just fad@@ ed, and I put on my mother's wedding dr@@ ess, and I married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure we were going to live happily ever after, because I loved him, and he loved me so much.
And he was very, very sorry.
He had just been really str@@ essed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me.
It was an isolated incid@@ ent, and he was never going to hurt me again.
It happened twice more on the honey@@ moon.
The first time, I was driving to find a secret beach and I got los@@ t, and he pun@@ ched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeate@@ dly hit the driver@@ 's side window.
And then a few days later, driving home from our honey@@ moon, he got frustrated by traffic@@ , and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face.
Con@@ or proce@@ e@@ ded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marri@@ age.
I was mistak@@ en in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation.
One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stal@@ king at some point in her life, and the CD@@ C reports that 15 million children are ab@@ used every year, 15 million.
So actually, I was in very good company.
Back to my question: Why did I st@@ ay?
The answer is easy.
I didn't know he was ab@@ using me.
Even though he held those loaded guns to my head, pushed me down stair@@ s, threatened to kill our dog, pulled the key out of the car ig@@ ni@@ tion as I drove down the high@@ way, poured coffee gr@@ in@@ ds on my head as I dressed for a job intervie@@ w, I never once thought of myself as a bat@@ tered wife.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troub@@ led man, and I was the only person on Earth who could help Con@@ or face his demon@@ s.
The other question everybody asks is, why doesn't she just leav@@ e?
Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time.
To me, this is the sad@@ dest and most painful question that people ask, because we victims know something you usually don@@ '@@ t: It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abus@@ er.
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her.
Over 70 percent of domestic violence mur@@ ders happen after the victim has ended the relationship, after she's gotten out, because then the ab@@ user has nothing left to los@@ e.
Other outcomes include long-term stal@@ king, even after the ab@@ user re@@ marri@@ es; denial of financial resourc@@ es; and manipul@@ ation of the family court system to terri@@ fy the victim and her children, who are regular@@ ly forced by family court jud@@ ges to spend un@@ super@@ vis@@ ed time with the man who beat their mother.
And still we ask, why doesn't she just leav@@ e?
I was able to leav@@ e, because of one final, sad@@ istic beating that broke through my deni@@ al.
I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him.
So I broke the silence.
I told every@@ one: the police, my neighbor@@ s, my friends and family, total strang@@ ers, and I'm here today because you all helped me.
We tend to stereo@@ type victims as gr@@ is@@ ly head@@ lines, self-@@ destructive women, dam@@ aged good@@ s.
The question, "Why does she stay@@ ?"
Is code for some people for, "It's her fault for stay@@ ing," as if victims inten@@ tion@@ ally choose to fall in love with men int@@ ent upon destroying us.
But since publishing "C@@ raz@@ y Lo@@ ve@@ ," I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out, who learned an inv@@ alu@@ able life lesson from what happened, and who re@@ built lives - jo@@ you@@ s, happy lives - as employees, wi@@ ves and mother@@ s, lives completely free of violence, like me.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence surviv@@ or.
I re@@ married a kind and gent@@ le man, and we have those three kids.
I have that black lab, and I have that min@@ iv@@ an.
What I will never have again, ever, is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me.
Right now, maybe you're thinking, "Wow, this is fascin@@ ating@@ ," or, "Wow, how stupid was she@@ ," but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you.
I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being ab@@ used or who were ab@@ used as children or who are ab@@ users themselves.
Ab@@ use could be affecting your daughter, your sis@@ ter, your best friend right now.
I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence.
I'm still breaking the silence today.
It's my way of helping other victim@@ s, and it's my final request of you.
Talk about what you heard here.
Ab@@ use thri@@ ves only in silence.
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spot@@ light on it.
We victims need everyone.
We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children, your co@@ workers, your friends and family.
Rec@@ ast surviv@@ ors as wonderful, lo@@ v@@ able people with full futur@@ es.
Re@@ cog@@ n@@ ize the early signs of violence and conscienti@@ ously interven@@ e, de@@ escal@@ ate it, show victims a safe way out.
Toge@@ ther we can make our be@@ ds, our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful o@@ ases they should be.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Cameron Russell adm@@ its she won “@@ a genetic lot@@ ter@@ y@@ ”@@ : she's tal@@ l, pretty and an under@@ wear model. But don't judge her by her loo@@ ks. In this fear@@ less talk, she takes a wr@@ y look at the industry that had her looking highly seduc@@ tive at barely 16 years old.
Cameron Rus@@ sell@@ : Loo@@ ks aren't everything. Beli@@ eve me, I'm a model.
H@@ i. My name is Cameron Rus@@ s@@ ell, and for the last little while, I've been a model.
Actually, for 10 years.
There's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have wor@@ n this dr@@ ess. So luckily, I brought an out@@ fit change.
This is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage, so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think.
If some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out, you don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.
I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds.
Not everybody gets to do that.
These he@@ els are very uncomfort@@ able, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.
The worst part is putting this swe@@ ater over my head, because that's when you'll all laugh at me, so don't do anything while it's over my head.
All right.
So, why did I do that?
That was awk@@ ward.
Well - Hope@@ fully not as awkward as that picture.
Imag@@ e is powerful, but also, image is superfici@@ al.
I just totally transformed what you thought of me, in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had actually never had a boy@@ friend in real life.
I was totally uncomfort@@ able, and the photographer was telling me to ar@@ ch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair.
And of course, barr@@ ing surgery, or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform how we look, and how we look, though it is super@@ ficial and im@@ mut@@ able, has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being fear@@ less means being hon@@ est.
And I am on this stage because I am a model.
I am on this stage because I am a pret@@ ty, white woman, and in my industry, we call that a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but with an honest tw@@ ist.
So the first question is, how do you become a model@@ ?
I always just say, "Oh, I was s@@ cou@@ ted@@ ," but that means nothing.
The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lot@@ ter@@ y, and I am the recipi@@ ent of a leg@@ acy, and maybe you're wondering what is a leg@@ acy.
Well, for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we're biolog@@ ically programmed to admi@@ re, but also as tal@@ l, sl@@ ender figur@@ es, and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin.
And this is a legacy that was built for me, and it's a legacy that I've been cas@@ hing out on.
And I know there are people in the audience who are skep@@ tical at this point, and maybe there are some fashion@@ istas who are like, "W@@ a@@ it. Na@@ om@@ i. T@@ yr@@ a. Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ all@@ s. L@@ iu W@@ en@@ ."
And first, I com@@ men@@ d you on your model knowledge. Very impress@@ ive.
But unfortunately, I have to inform you that in 2007, a very inspired NY@@ U Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way, every single one that was hi@@ red, and of the 6@@ 7@@ 7 models that were hi@@ red, only 2@@ 7, or less than four percent, were non-@@ whi@@ te.
The next question people always ask is, "Can I be a model when I grow up@@ ?"
And the first answer is, "I don't know, they don't put me in charge of that."
But the second answer, and what I really want to say to these little girls is, "@@ Why? You know? You can be anything.
You could be the President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o@@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon po@@ et, which would be aweso@@ me, because you'd be the first one."
I@@ f, after this amazing list, they still are like, "No, no, Camer@@ on, I want to be a model@@ ," well, then I say, "B@@ e my b@@ oss@@ ."
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H@@ &amp;@@ M, or the next Steven Me@@ is@@ el.
S@@ ay@@ ing that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up.
It's out of your control, and it's aweso@@ me, and it's not a career path.
I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumul@@ ated model knowledge, because unlike cardi@@ o@@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surge@@ ons, it can just be dis@@ til@@ led right now.
So, if the photographer is right there, the light is right there, like a nice H@@ MI@@ , and the client says, "We want a walking sho@@ t@@ ," this leg goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward, the head is at three quar@@ ters, and you just go back and forth, just do that, and then you look back at your imagin@@ ary friends, 3@@ 00, 4@@ 00, 500 times.
It will look something like this. Hope@@ fully less awkward than that one in the middle.
That was - I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, after you've gone to school, and you have a r@@ és@@ um@@ é and you've done a few jobs, you can't say anything anymore, so if you say you want to be the President of the United States, but your r@@ és@@ um@@ é read@@ s, "@@ Under@@ wear Mod@@ el: 10 year@@ s," people give you a funny look.
The next question is, "Do they re@@ touch all the photos@@ ?"
And yeah, they pretty much re@@ touch all the pho@@ tos, but that is only a small component of what's happening.
This picture is the very first picture that I ever to@@ ok, and it's also the very first time that I had wor@@ n a bi@@ kin@@ i, and I didn't even have my period yet.
I know we're getting person@@ al, but I was a young girl.
This is what I looked like with my grand@@ ma just a few months earlier.
Here's me on the same day as this shoo@@ t.
My friend got to come.
Here's me at a slum@@ ber party a few days before I shot French Vo@@ gue.
Here's me on the soccer team and in V Magaz@@ ine.
And here's me today.
And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They are construc@@ tions, and they are construc@@ tions by a group of profession@@ als, by hair@@ st@@ yl@@ ists and make@@ up artists and photograp@@ hers and st@@ yl@@ ists and all of their assist@@ ants and pre-@@ production and post-@@ production, and they build this. That's not me.
Okay, so the next question people always ask me is, "Do you get free stuff@@ ?"
I do have too many 8@@ -@@ inch he@@ els which I never get to we@@ ar, except for earlier, but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life, and that's what we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenag@@ er, I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course, we got pulled over, and all it took was a "S@@ orr@@ y, offic@@ er@@ ," and we were on our way.
And I got these free things because of how I look, not who I am, and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the 1@@ 40,000 teenagers that were stopped and fr@@ is@@ k@@ ed, 8@@ 6% of them were black and Lat@@ ino, and most of them were young men.
And there are only 17@@ 7,000 young black and Lat@@ ino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of, "W@@ ill I get stop@@ ped@@ ?"
But "How many times will I get stop@@ ped@@ ? When will I get stop@@ ped@@ ?"
When I was researching this talk, I found out that of the 13@@ -year-old girls in the United States, 5@@ 3% don't like their bodies, and that number goes to 7@@ 8% by the time that they're 17.
So, the last question people ask me is, "What is it like to be a model@@ ?"
And I think the answer that they're looking for is, "If you are a little bit skin@@ ni@@ er and you have shin@@ ier hair, you will be so happy and fabul@@ ous@@ ."
And when we're back@@ stage, we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that.
We say, "It's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work with creative, inspi@@ red, passionate people@@ ."
And those things are true, but they're only one half of the story, because the thing that we never say on camera, that I have never said on camera, is, "I am insec@@ ure@@ ."
And I'm in@@ secure because I have to think about what I look like every day.
And if you ever are wondering, "If I have thin@@ ner th@@ igh@@ s and shin@@ ier hair, will I be happi@@ er@@ ?"
You just need to meet a group of models, because they have the thin@@ nest th@@ igh@@ s, the shin@@ iest hair and the cool@@ est clothes, and they're the most physically in@@ secure women probably on the planet.
When I was writing this talk, I found it very difficult to strike an honest bal@@ ance, because on the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say, "@@ Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stac@@ ked in my favor@@ ," and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with, "@@ and it doesn't always make me happ@@ y."
But mostly it was difficult to un@@ pack a legacy of gender and racial op@@ pression when I am one of the biggest benefici@@ aries.
But I'm also happy and honor@@ ed to be up here and I think that it's great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career, because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college, which seems so important right now.
If there's a take@@ away to this talk, I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowled@@ ging the power of image in our perceived succ@@ esses and our perceived fail@@ ures.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: A long time ago in New York City, Steve Ad@@ d@@ is stood on a corner holding his 1@@ -year-old daughter in his arm@@ s; his wife sn@@ apped a pho@@ to. The image has inspired an annual father@@ -@@ daughter ritu@@ al, where Ad@@ d@@ is and his daughter pose for the same picture, on the same corner, each year. Ad@@ d@@ is shares 15 treas@@ ured photographs from the seri@@ es, and explores why this small, repeated ritual means so much.
Steven Ad@@ dis@@ : A father@@ -@@ daughter bon@@ d, one photo at a time.
Pho@@ to@@ graphy has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera, but today I want to share with you the 15 most treas@@ ured photos of mine, and I didn't take any of them.
There were no art direc@@ tors, no sty@@ list@@ s, no chance for res@@ ho@@ ots, not even any regard for ligh@@ ting.
In fact, most of them were taken by random tour@@ ists.
My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engag@@ ement, and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birth@@ day. We're on the corner of 5@@ 7@@ th and 5@@ th.
We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well you can see where this is going.
Ap@@ pro@@ aching my daugh@@ ter's third birth@@ day, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sab@@ ina back to New York and make it a father@@ -@@ daughter tri@@ p, and continue the rit@@ ual@@ ?"
This is when we started asking passing tour@@ ists to take the picture.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gest@@ ure is of hand@@ ing your camera to a total strang@@ er.
No one's ever refu@@ sed, and luc@@ kil@@ y no one's ever run off with our camera.
Back then, we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives.
It's really become sacred to us.
This one was taken just weeks after 9/11, and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a fi@@ ve@@ -year-old could understand.
So these photos are far more than pro@@ x@@ ies for a single moment, or even a specific tri@@ p.
They're also ways for us to free@@ ze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year, and not just physic@@ ally, but in every way.
Because while we take the same photo, our perspec@@ tives change, and she reaches new mil@@ est@@ ones, and I get to see life through her eyes, and how she interac@@ ts with and sees everything.
This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cher@@ ish and anticipate the entire year.
Rec@@ ently, on one tri@@ p, we were wal@@ king, and she stops dead in her track@@ s, and she points to a red aw@@ ning of the dol@@ l store that she loved when she was little on our earlier tri@@ ps.
And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a fi@@ ve@@ -year-old standing in that exact spo@@ t.
She said she remem@@ bers her heart burst@@ ing out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier.
And now what she's looking at in New York are colleg@@ es, because she's determined to go to school in New York.
And it hit me: One of the most important things we all make are memor@@ ies.
So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memor@@ ies.
I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 sho@@ ts, I'm not in many of the family pho@@ tos.
I'm always the one taking the picture.
So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot, and don't hesit@@ ate to go up to someone and ask, "W@@ ill you take our pic@@ ture@@ ?"
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As natural garbage collec@@ tors, vul@@ tures are vital to our ecosystem - so why all the bad press@@ ? Why are so many in danger of extinc@@ tion? Rap@@ tor biologist Mun@@ ir Vir@@ ani says we need to pay more attention to these unique and mis@@ understood creatures, to change our perception and save the vul@@ tures.
Mun@@ ir Vir@@ ani: Why I love vul@@ tures.
I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
V@@ ul@@ tures are amongst the most threatened group of birds.
When you see a vul@@ ture like this, the first thing that comes to your mind is, these are disg@@ ust@@ ing, ug@@ ly, gre@@ edy creatures that are just after your fl@@ es@@ h, associated with politici@@ ans. I want to change that percep@@ tion. I want to change those feelings you have for these birds, because they need our sympath@@ y. They really do. And I'll tell you why.
First of all, why do they have such a bad press@@ ?
When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 18@@ 32 on the Be@@ ag@@ le, he saw the tur@@ key vul@@ ture, and he said, "@@ These are disgus@@ ting birds with bal@@ d scar@@ let heads that are formed to re@@ vel in pu@@ tr@@ id@@ ity." You could not get a worse insul@@ t, and that from Charles Darwin. You know, he changed his mind when he came back, and I'll tell you why.
They've also be associated with Disney — — person@@ i@@ fied as go@@ of@@ y, d@@ umb@@ , stupid character@@ s.
More recently, if you've been following the Keny@@ an press — — these are the attribu@@ tes that they associated the Keny@@ an MP@@ s with. But I want to challenge that.
I want to challenge that. Do you know why?
Because MP@@ s do not keep the environment cle@@ an. MP@@ s do not help to prevent the spread of diseases.
They are hardly mon@@ og@@ am@@ ous. They are far from being extinc@@ t. And, my favorite is, vul@@ tures are better loo@@ king. So there's two types of vul@@ tures in this planet.
There are the New World vul@@ tures that are mainly found in the Americ@@ as, like the cond@@ ors and the car@@ ac@@ ar@@ as, and then the O@@ ld World vul@@ tures, where we have 16 species. From these 16, 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinc@@ tion.
So why are vul@@ tures important? First of all, they provide vital ecological services. They clean up.
They're our natural garbage collec@@ tors.
They clean up car@@ c@@ asses right to the bon@@ e.
They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anth@@ ra@@ x that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock los@@ ses and diseases in other animals.
Rec@@ ent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vul@@ tures, car@@ c@@ asses take up to three to four times to de@@ compos@@ e, and this has huge ramific@@ ations for the spread of diseases.
V@@ ul@@ tures also have tremendous historical signific@@ ance.
They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture.
Ne@@ k@@ h@@ bet was the symbol of the protec@@ tor and the mother@@ ho@@ od, and together with the cobr@@ a, symbol@@ ized the un@@ ity between Up@@ per and Lo@@ wer Egyp@@ t.
In Hind@@ u myth@@ ology, J@@ at@@ ay@@ u was the vul@@ ture g@@ od, and he ris@@ ked his life in order to save the god@@ des@@ s S@@ ita from the 10-@@ headed dem@@ on R@@ av@@ ana.
In Ti@@ bet@@ an culture, they are performing very important sky buri@@ als. In places like Tibe@@ t, there are no places to bury the dead, or wood to cre@@ mate them, so these vul@@ tures provide a natural dispos@@ al system.
So what is the problem with vul@@ tur@@ es?
We have eight species of vul@@ tures that occur in Kenya, of which six are highly threatened with extinc@@ tion.
The reason is that they're getting poison@@ ed, and the reason that they're getting poison@@ ed is because there's human-@@ wildlife conflic@@ ts. The pas@@ tor@@ al communities are using this poison to target predat@@ ors, and in re@@ turn, the vul@@ tures are falling victim to this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of vul@@ tures are listed as critically endang@@ er@@ ed, which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinc@@ t, and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a pain@@ killing drug like Dic@@ lo@@ fen@@ ac@@ .
This drug has now been ban@@ ned for veterin@@ ary use in India, and they have taken a stand@@ .
Because there are no vul@@ tures, there's been a spread in the numbers of fer@@ al dogs at car@@ cas@@ s dum@@ p sites, and when you have fer@@ al do@@ gs, you have a huge time bomb of rab@@ ies. The number of cases of rab@@ ies has increased tremend@@ ously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Afric@@ a: 3@@ 53 wind turbin@@ es are going to be up at Lake Turk@@ ana.
I am not against wind energy, but we need to work with the governments, because wind turbin@@ es do this to birds. They slice them in half.
They are bir@@ d-@@ bl@@ ending machines.
In West Africa, there's a horri@@ fic trade of dead vul@@ tures to serve the wit@@ ch@@ craft and the fe@@ tish market.
So what's being don@@ e? Well, we're conduc@@ ting research on these birds. We're putting transmit@@ ters on them.
We're trying to determine their basic ecolog@@ y, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel different countries, so if you focus on a problem loc@@ ally, it's not going to help you.
We need to work with governments in regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreci@@ ating vul@@ tures, about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provid@@ e.
How can you help@@ ? You can become active, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very mis@@ understood creatures. Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er your time to spread the word. S@@ pre@@ ad the word.
When you walk out of this room, you will be informed about vul@@ tures, but speak to your families, to your children, to your neighbors about vul@@ tures.
They are very grac@@ eful@@ . Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly ef@@ fort@@ lessly without energy in the sk@@ ies.
Kenya, this world, will be much poor@@ er without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.

Er@@ n@@ esto Sir@@ ol@@ li@@ : W@@ ant to help some@@ one? Sh@@ ut up and listen@@ !
Everything I do, and everything I do profession@@ ally - my life - has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa.
From 197@@ 1 to 197@@ 7 - I look young, but I'm not — - I worked in Z@@ ambi@@ a, Kenya, I@@ v@@ ory Co@@ ast, Al@@ ger@@ ia, Somali@@ a, in projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NG@@ O, and every single project that we set up in Africa failed.
And I was distr@@ augh@@ t.
I thought, age 21, that we Ital@@ ians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead, everything we touched we killed.
Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book, "@@ Ri@@ p@@ ples from the Z@@ am@@ be@@ zi@@ ," was a project where we Ital@@ ians decided to teach Z@@ ambi@@ an people how to grow food.
So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Z@@ amb@@ ia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Z@@ am@@ be@@ zi Ri@@ ver, and we taught the local people how to grow Italian toma@@ toes and z@@ uc@@ chin@@ i and ...
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that, so we paid them to come and work, and sometimes they would show up. And we were amazed that the local people, in such a fer@@ tile val@@ ley, would not have any agriculture.
But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here." "@@ Just in the nic@@ k of time to save the Z@@ ambi@@ an people from star@@ v@@ ation."
And of course, everything in Africa grew beauti@@ fully.
We had these magnificent toma@@ to@@ es. In Italy, a toma@@ to would grow to this size. In Z@@ ambi@@ a, to this size.
And we could not believe, and we were telling the Z@@ ambi@@ ans, "@@ Look how easy agriculture is."
When the toma@@ toes were nice and ri@@ pe and red, over@@ night, some 200 hi@@ pp@@ os came out from the river and they ate everything. And we said to the Z@@ ambi@@ ans, "My God, the hip@@ pos@@ !"
And the Z@@ ambi@@ ans said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here." "Why didn't you tell us@@ ?@@ "@@ "You never ask@@ ed."
I thought it was only us Ital@@ ians bl@@ under@@ ing around Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing, what the English were doing, what the French were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I became quite proud of our project in Z@@ ambi@@ a.
Because, you see, at least we fed the hip@@ pos.
You should see the rub@@ b@@ ish — - You should see the rub@@ b@@ ish that we have best@@ o@@ wed on un@@ suspec@@ ting African people.
You want to read the book, read "De@@ ad A@@ id@@ ," by D@@ amb@@ isa Mo@@ y@@ o, Z@@ ambi@@ an woman econom@@ ist.
The book was published in 2009.
We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done.
Just go and read her book.
Re@@ ad it from an African woman, the damage that we have done.
We Western people are imperi@@ al@@ ist, colon@@ i@@ alist mission@@ aries, and there are only two ways we deal with people@@ : We either pa@@ tron@@ ize them, or we are patern@@ alis@@ tic.
The two words come from the Latin root "@@ pat@@ er@@ ," which means "@@ father@@ ."
But they mean two different things.
P@@ ater@@ n@@ alis@@ tic, I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much@@ ."
Patr@@ on@@ iz@@ ing, I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my serv@@ ants.
That's why the white people in Africa are called "@@ b@@ wan@@ a," bos@@ s.
I was given a s@@ lap in the face reading a book, "S@@ mall is Be@@ auti@@ ful@@ ," written by S@@ chu@@ mach@@ er, who said, above all in economic development, if people do not wish to be hel@@ ped, leave them alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respec@@ t.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor, and said, "Can we - can you imagine a city that is not ne@@ o@@ colon@@ i@@ al?"
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people, and I invented a system called En@@ ter@@ pris@@ e F@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ation, where you never initi@@ ate anything, you never motivate any@@ body, but you become a serv@@ ant of the local passion, the serv@@ ant of local people who have a dream to become a better person.
So what you do - you shut up.
You never arrive in a community with any ideas, and you sit with the local people.
We don't work from offic@@ es.
We meet at the caf@@ e. We meet at the pub@@ .
We have zero infrastructure.
And what we do, we become friends, and we find out what that person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give somebody an idea.
If that person doesn't want to do it, what are you going to do?
The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them to go and find the knowledge, because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why don't we, for once, instead of arri@@ ving in the community to tell people what to do, why don't, for once, listen to them? But not in community meet@@ ings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There is a problem with community meet@@ ings.
Entre@@ prene@@ ur@@ s never come, and they never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have identi@@ fied.
So planning has this blind spo@@ t.
The smar@@ test people in your community you don't even know, because they don't come to your public meet@@ ings.
What we do, we work one-@@ on-@@ one, and to work one-@@ on-@@ one, you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
You have to create a new profess@@ ion.
The profess@@ ion is the family doctor of enterpris@@ e, the family doctor of business, who sits with you in your house, at your kitchen table, at the caf@@ e, and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living.
I started this as a tr@@ y@@ out in Esper@@ ance, in Western Australia.
I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to go away from this pa@@ tron@@ izing bull@@ sh@@ it that we arrive and tell you what to do.
And so what I did in Esper@@ ance that first year was to just walk the streets, and in three days I had my first cli@@ ent, and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a gar@@ age, was a Ma@@ or@@ i guy, and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Per@@ th, to get organiz@@ ed, and then the fisher@@ men came to me to say, "You the guy who helped Ma@@ ori@@ ? Can you help us@@ ?"
And I helped these five fisher@@ men to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the can@@ ner@@ y in Al@@ b@@ any for 60 cents a kil@@ o, but we found a way to take the fish for sus@@ hi to Japan for 15 dollars a kil@@ o, and the farmers came to talk to me, said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us@@ ?"
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to see me to say, "How can you do that?
How can you do — ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult.
I shut up, and listen to them." So — — So the government says, "Do it again." We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solit@@ u@@ de.
Peter Dr@@ uck@@ er, one of the greatest management consul@@ tant@@ s in history, died age 9@@ 6, a few years ago.
Peter Dr@@ uc@@ ker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business, and this is what Peter Dr@@ uc@@ ker sa@@ ys: "P@@ lan@@ ning is actually in@@ compati@@ ble with an entrepreneurial society and econom@@ y."
Plan@@ ning is the kiss of death of entrepreneur@@ ship.
So now you're re@@ building Christ@@ church without knowing what the smar@@ test people in Christ@@ church want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you.
You have to offer them conf@@ identi@@ ality, privac@@ y, you have to be fantastic at helping them, and then they will come, and they will come in dro@@ ves.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 cli@@ ents.
Can you imagine a community of 4@@ 00,000 people, the intelligence and the passion@@ ?
Which presentation have you applau@@ ded the most this mor@@ n@@ ing?
Loc@@ al, passionate people. That's who you have applau@@ ded.
So what I'm saying is that entrepreneur@@ ship is where it's at.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution - non@@ renewable fossil fuel@@ s, manufacturing - and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable.
The internal combus@@ tion engine is not sustainable.
Fre@@ on way of maintaining things is not sustainable.
What we have to look at is at how we fe@@ ed, c@@ ure, educa@@ te, transport@@ , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way.
The technologies do not exist to do that.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolu@@ tion? Univer@@ si@@ ti@@ es? Forget about it!
Govern@@ ment@@ ? Forget about it!
It will be entrepreneur@@ s, and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that I read in a futur@@ ist magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 18@@ 60.
And in 18@@ 60, this group of people came together, and they all specul@@ ated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was un@@ anim@@ ous@@ : The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and said, if the population keeps growing at this rate, to move the population of New York around, they would have needed six million hor@@ ses, and the man@@ ure created by six million hor@@ ses would be impossible to deal with.
They were already dro@@ wning in man@@ ure. So 18@@ 60, they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to cho@@ ke the life out of New York.
So what happens? In 40 year@@ s' time, in the year 1900, in the United States of America, there were 1,@@ 00@@ 1 car manufacturing companies - 1,@@ 00@@ 1.
The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over, and there were tiny, tiny little factories in back@@ wat@@ ers.
D@@ ear@@ born, Michig@@ an. Henry For@@ d.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneur@@ s.
First, you have to offer them conf@@ identi@@ ality.
Other@@ wise they don't come and talk to you.
Then you have to offer them absolu@@ te, dedic@@ ated, passionate service to them.
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneur@@ ship.
The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be capable of doing three things beauti@@ ful@@ ly: The product that you want to sell has to be fantas@@ tic, you have to have fantastic marketing, and you have to have tremendous financial manag@@ ement.
Gu@@ ess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money.
It doesn't exist.
This person has never been born.
We've done the research, and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world - Carne@@ gi@@ e, West@@ ing@@ house, Edis@@ on, For@@ d, all the new companies, Google, Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o.
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common@@ , only one: None were started by one person.
Now we teach entrepreneur@@ ship to 16@@ -@@ year-olds in Nor@@ th@@ um@@ ber@@ land, and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Br@@ ans@@ on's autobio@@ graphy, and the task of the 16@@ -@@ year-olds is to under@@ line, in the first two pages of Richard Br@@ ans@@ on's autobio@@ graphy how many times Richard uses the word "I@@ " and how many times he uses the word "@@ we@@ ."
Never the word "I@@ ," and the word "@@ we@@ " 32 times.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody started a company alone. No one.
So we can create the community where we have facilit@@ ators who come from a small business background sitting in caf@@ es, in bar@@ s, and your dedicated bud@@ dies who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this e@@ pic@@ , somebody who will say to you, "What do you need@@ ?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money@@ ?"
"Oh, no, I cannot do this@@ .@@ "@@ "Would you like me to find you some@@ bod@@ y?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers supporting the En@@ ter@@ pris@@ e F@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by captur@@ ing the passion, the energy and imagination of your own people.
Thank you.

There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives.
We don't bum@@ p into every neigh@@ bor, so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on, though we do share the same public spaces.
So over the past few years, I've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space, using simple tools like stick@@ ers, st@@ enc@@ ils and chal@@ k.
And these projects came from questions I had, like@@ : How much are my neighbors paying for their apart@@ ment@@ s?
How can we l@@ end and borrow more things, without knoc@@ king on each other's doors at a bad time?
How can we share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and gain a better understanding of our landsca@@ pe@@ ?
How can we share more of our hopes for our vac@@ ant stor@@ e@@ fron@@ ts, so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today?
Now, I live in New Orle@@ ans, and I am in love with New Orle@@ ans.
My soul is always so@@ o@@ th@@ ed by the giant live o@@ ak trees, sh@@ ading lo@@ vers, dr@@ un@@ ks and dream@@ ers for hundreds of years, and I trust a city that always makes way for music.
I feel like every time someone s@@ nee@@ z@@ es, New Orle@@ ans has a par@@ ade. The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America.
I live near this house, and I thought about how I could make it a nic@@ er space for my neighborhood, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much.
Her name was Jo@@ an, and she was a mother to me.
And her death was sudden and un@@ expected.
And I thought about death a lot.
And ... this made me feel deep gr@@ atitude for the time I've had.
And ... brought clar@@ ity to the things that are meaningful to my life now.
But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life.
I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day@@ -to-@@ day, and forget what really matters to you.
So with help from old and new friends, I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chal@@ k@@ board, and st@@ enci@@ led it with a fil@@ l-@@ in-@@ the-@@ blank sent@@ ence: "@@ Before I die, I want to ..."
So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chal@@ k, reflect on their life, and share their personal aspir@@ ations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but by the next day, the wall was entirely filled out, and it kept growing.
And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall.
"@@ Before I die, I want to be tried for pir@@ ac@@ y." "@@ Before I die, I want to str@@ ad@@ dle the International D@@ ate@@ lin@@ e."
"@@ Before I die, I want to sing for million@@ s."
"@@ Before I die, I want to plant a tre@@ e."
"@@ Before I die, I want to live off the gr@@ id@@ ."
"@@ Before I die, I want to hold her one more time."
"@@ Before I die, I want to be someone's caval@@ r@@ y."
"@@ Before I die, I want to be completely my@@ self."
So this neg@@ lec@@ ted space became a construc@@ tive one, and people's hopes and dreams made me laugh out lou@@ d, tear up, and they con@@ so@@ led me during my own tough times.
It's about knowing you're not al@@ on@@ e; it's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlighten@@ ing wa@@ ys@@ ; it's about making space for reflection and contempl@@ ation, and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change.
I made this last year, and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community.
So, my civic center colleagues and I made a tool k@@ it, and now walls have been made in countries around the world, including K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ st@@ an, South Africa, Australia, Argentina, and beyon@@ d.
Toge@@ ther, we've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we're given the opportunity to have a voice, and share more with one another.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time, and our relationships with other people.
In our age of increasing distrac@@ tions, it's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective, and remember that life is brief and tend@@ er.
De@@ ath is something that we're often dis@@ cour@@ aged to talk about, or even think about, but I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do.
Th@@ in@@ king about death clari@@ fies your life.
Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us, as individuals and as a community, and with more ways to share our hop@@ es, fears and stories, the people around us can not only help us make better places, they can help us lead better lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Fa@@ ith Je@@ ge@@ de tells the moving and funny story of growing up with her two brother@@ s, both autistic - and both extraordinary. In this talk from the TED Tal@@ ent S@@ ear@@ ch, she reminds us to pursue a life beyond what is normal.
Fa@@ ith Je@@ ge@@ de Co@@ le: What I've learned from my autistic brother@@ s.
Today I have just one request@@ .
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brother@@ s.
Rem@@ i is 2@@ 2, tall and very hand@@ some@@ .
He's spee@@ ch@@ less, but he communic@@ ates joy in a way that some of the best or@@ ators can@@ not.
Rem@@ i knows what love is.
He shares it un@@ condition@@ ally and he shares it reg@@ ard@@ less.
He's not gre@@ ed@@ y. He doesn't see skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differ@@ ences, and get this: He has never told a li@@ e.
When he s@@ ings songs from our childhood, attemp@@ ting words that not even I could remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel is 16. He's tal@@ l. He's very hand@@ some@@ .
He has the most im@@ pec@@ cable memory.
He has a selec@@ tive one, though.
He doesn't remember if he st@@ ole my chocolate bar, but he remem@@ bers the year of release for every song on my iP@@ od, conversations we had when he was four, wee@@ ing on my arm on the first ever episode of Tele@@ tub@@ bi@@ es, and Lady G@@ ag@@ a's birth@@ day.
Don't they sound incredi@@ ble@@ ?
But most people don't agre@@ e.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into societ@@ y's version of normal, they're often by@@ passed and mis@@ understo@@ od.
But what lifted my heart and streng@@ th@@ ened my soul was that even though this was the case, although they were not seen as ordin@@ ary, this could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary - autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for you who may be less familiar with the term "@@ autism@@ ," it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
It manifest@@ s in each individual differently, h@@ ence why Rem@@ i is so different from S@@ am.
And across the world, every 20 minutes, one new person is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of the fas@@ test@@ -@@ growing developmental disorders in the world, there is no known cause or c@@ ure.
And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism, but I cannot recall a day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came along, and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life.
And after a few months went by, I realized that he was different.
He scre@@ amed a lot.
He didn't want to play like the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me whatsoever.
Rem@@ i lived and re@@ igned in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like lin@@ ing up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between.
And as he grew older, he grew more different, and the differences became more obvious.
Yet beyond the tan@@ tr@@ ums and the frustr@@ ation and the never@@ -@@ ending hyper@@ activity was something really uni@@ que: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejud@@ ice, a human who had never li@@ ed.
Ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary.
Now, I cannot den@@ y that there have been some challenging moments in my family, moments where I've wished that they were just like me.
But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me about individual@@ ity and communication and love, and I realize that these are things that I wouldn't want to change with normal@@ ity.
Nor@@ mal@@ ity over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us, and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's a different kind of right.
And if I could communicate just one thing to Rem@@ i and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that we have - We've got a gif@@ t@@ ! Ever@@ yon@@ e's got a gift inside of us, and in all honest@@ y, the pursuit of normal@@ ity is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The chance for great@@ ness, for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else.
Please - don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Mel@@ is@@ sa Marshall brings a message to all scientists : We're fascinated by what you're doing. So tell us about it - in a way we can understand. In just 4 minutes, she shares powerful tips on presenting complex scientific ideas to a general audience.
Mel@@ is@@ sa Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ : Talk ner@@ dy to me.
Five years ago, I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Won@@ der@@ land.
Pen@@ n State asked me, a communications teacher, to teach a communications class for engineering students.
And I was scar@@ ed. Really scar@@ ed. S@@ cared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big, un@@ familiar words.
But as these conversations un@@ fol@@ ded, I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rab@@ bit hole and saw that door to a whole new world.
That's just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students. I was amazed at the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonder@@ land as well.
And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication.
We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tack@@ ling our gran@@ dest challenges, from energy to environment to health care, among others, and if we don't know about it and understand it, then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility as non-@@ scientists to have these interac@@ tions.
But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonder@@ land.
So scientists and engineers, please, talk ner@@ dy to us.
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engag@@ ing.
First question to answer for us: so what?
Tell us why your science is relevant to us.
Don't just tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae, but tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae, which is the mes@@ h@@ -like structure of our bones because it's important to understanding and treating os@@ te@@ o@@ por@@ os@@ is.
And when you're describing your science, be@@ ware of jarg@@ on.
J@@ arg@@ on is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.
S@@ ure, you can say "@@ spatial and tempor@@ al@@ ," but why not just say "@@ space and time@@ ," which is so much more accessible to us?
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as d@@ umb@@ ing it down.
Instead, as Einstein said, make everything as simple as possible, but no simpl@@ er.
You can clearly communicate your science without compromis@@ ing the ideas.
A few things to consider are having examples, stories and analogi@@ es. Those are ways to engage and exc@@ ite us about your content.
And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.
Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet point@@ s? What do bul@@ lets do? B@@ ul@@ lets kill@@ , and they will kill your presentation.
A slide like this is not only bor@@ ing, but it reli@@ es too much on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhel@@ med.
Instead, this example slide by G@@ ene@@ vi@@ eve Brown is much more effective. It's showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the E@@ if@@ fel To@@ w@@ er.
And the trick here is to use a single, read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit los@@ t, and then provide visu@@ als which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what's being descri@@ bed.
So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engineering.
And because the engineers that I've worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner ner@@ d, I want to summar@@ ize with an equ@@ ation. Take your science, sub@@ tract your bullet points and your jarg@@ on, divide by relev@@ ance, meaning share what's relevant to the audience, and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you're doing, and that is going to equal incredible interac@@ tions.
That are full of understanding.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equ@@ ation, by all means, talk ner@@ dy to me. Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Most politicians choose their words carefully, to shape the reality they hope to create. But does it work? E@@ ty@@ m@@ ologist Mark For@@ sy@@ th shares a few entertain@@ ing wor@@ d-@@ origin stories from British and American history and draws a surprising conclus@@ ion.
Mark For@@ sy@@ th@@ : What's a sn@@ ol@@ ly@@ gos@@ ter? A short lesson in political speak.
One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dic@@ tionary is "@@ sn@@ ol@@ ly@@ gos@@ ter."
Just because it sounds so good.
And what sn@@ ol@@ ly@@ gos@@ ter means is "a dis@@ honest politici@@ an."
Although there was a 19@@ th-century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said, "A sn@@ ol@@ ly@@ gos@@ ter is a fellow who see@@ ks office regardless of party, platform or principle, and who, when he win@@ s, gets there by the sheer force of monument@@ al tal@@ kno@@ ph@@ ical assum@@ n@@ anc@@ y."
Now I have no idea what "@@ tal@@ kno@@ ph@@ ic@@ al" is.
Something to do with words, I assum@@ e.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know they have to try and control language.
It wasn't un@@ til, for example, 17@@ 7@@ 1 that the British Parli@@ ament allowed news@@ papers to report the exact words that were said in the deb@@ ating cham@@ ber.
And this was actually all down to the br@@ aver@@ y of a guy with the extraordinary name of Br@@ ass Cros@@ by, who took on Parli@@ ament@@ .
And he was thrown into the To@@ wer of London and imprison@@ ed, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to take them on, and in the end he had such popular support in London that he w@@ on.
And it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase "@@ as bold as br@@ ass@@ ."
Most people think that's down to the metal.
It's not. It's down to a campaig@@ ner for the freedom of the press@@ .
But to really show you how words and politics interac@@ t, I want to take you back to the United States of America, just after they'd achieved independ@@ ence.
And they had to face the question of what to call George Washington, their lead@@ er.
They didn't know.
What do you call the leader of a republic@@ an countr@@ y?
And this was deb@@ ated in Congress for ages and ages.
And there were all sorts of sugges@@ tions on the table, which might have made it.
I mean, some people wanted him to be called Chi@@ ef Mag@@ istr@@ ate Washington, and other people, His High@@ ness George Washington, and other people, Pro@@ tec@@ tor of the Liber@@ ties of the People of the United States of America Washington.
Not that cat@@ ch@@ y.
Some people just wanted to call him K@@ ing.
They thought it was tried and teste@@ d.
And they weren't even being mon@@ arch@@ ical there, they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term.
And, you know, it could have worked.
And everybody got insan@@ ely bor@@ ed, actually, because this debate went on for three weeks.
I read a di@@ ary of this poor sen@@ ator, who just keeps coming back, "S@@ till on this subjec@@ t."
And the reason for the del@@ ay and the bore@@ dom was that the House of Re@@ present@@ atives were against the Sen@@ ate.
The House of Re@@ present@@ atives didn't want Washington to get drunk on power.
They didn't want to call him King in case that gave him ideas, or his succ@@ essor ideas.
So they wanted to give him the hum@@ bl@@ est, me@@ ag@@ er@@ est, most pa@@ thetic title that they could think of.
And that title was "P@@ resid@@ ent@@ ."
Presid@@ ent. They didn't invent the tit@@ le. I mean, it existed before, but it just meant somebody who presid@@ es over a meeting.
It was like the fore@@ man of the jur@@ y.
And it didn't have much more grande@@ ur than the term "@@ for@@ eman@@ " or "@@ over@@ se@@ er."
There were occasion@@ al presid@@ ents of little colon@@ ial coun@@ c@@ ils and bits of government, but it was really a nothing tit@@ le.
And that's why the Sen@@ ate objec@@ ted to it.
They said, that's ridicul@@ ous, you can't call him Presid@@ ent.
This guy has to go and sign tre@@ ati@@ es and meet foreign dign@@ it@@ aries.
And who's going to take him seriously if he's got a silly little title like President of the United States of Americ@@ a?
And after three weeks of debate, in the end the Sen@@ ate did not cave in.
Instead, they agreed to use the title "P@@ resid@@ ent@@ " for now, but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn't agree with it from a decent respect for the opin@@ ions and practice of civiliz@@ ed nations, whether under republic@@ an or mon@@ arch@@ ical forms of government, whose cus@@ tom it is to an@@ nex@@ , through the office of the Chi@@ ef Mag@@ istr@@ ate, titles of respec@@ t@@ ability - not bloody President - and that in the inter@@ course with foreign nations.
The maj@@ est@@ y of the people of the United States may not be haz@@ ar@@ ded by an appear@@ ance of singular@@ ity, i@@ .@@ e@@ ., we don't want to look like bloody weir@@ dos.
Now you can learn three interesting things from this.
First of all - and this is my favorite - is that so far as I've ever been able to find out, the Sen@@ ate has never form@@ ally end@@ or@@ sed the title of Presid@@ ent.
Barack Ob@@ ama, President Ob@@ ama, is there on borro@@ wed time, just waiting for the Sen@@ ate to spring into action.
Second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure - - you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later.
But the third thing you can learn, and this is the really important one, this is the point I want to leave you on, is that the tit@@ le, President of the United States of America, doesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it?
Something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his dispos@@ al and the largest economy in the world and a fle@@ et of drones and all that sort of stuff.
Re@@ ality and history have endo@@ wed that title with grande@@ ur@@ .
And so the Sen@@ ate won in the end.
They got their title of respec@@ t@@ ability.
And also, the Sen@@ ate@@ 's other worr@@ y, the appear@@ ance of singular@@ ity - well, it was a singular@@ ity back then.
But now, do you know how many nations have a presid@@ ent@@ ?
A hundred and for@@ ty-@@ seven@@ .
All because they want to sound like the guy who's got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads, etc.
And so, in the end, the Sen@@ ate won and the House of Re@@ present@@ atives los@@ t, because no@@ body's going to feel that humble when they're told that they are now the President of the United States of America.
And that's the important lesson I think you can take away, and the one I want to leave you with.
Pol@@ iti@@ ci@@ ans try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Pho@@ to@@ grapher Lisa Kr@@ istine travels the world documenting the un@@ bear@@ ably har@@ sh real@@ ities of modern@@ -day slaver@@ y. She shares ha@@ unt@@ ingly beautiful images - min@@ ers in the Congo, br@@ ick@@ layers in Nep@@ al - that illumin@@ ate the p@@ light of the 27 million soul@@ s ens@@ lav@@ ed worldwide.
Lisa Kr@@ ist@@ ine@@ : Pho@@ tos that bear witness to modern slaver@@ y.
I'm 150 feet down an illegal mine sh@@ aft in Gh@@ ana.
The air is thick with heat and d@@ ust, and it's hard to brea@@ the.
I can feel the brush of sweat@@ y bodies passing me in the dark@@ ness, but I can't see much else.
I hear voices talking, but mostly the sh@@ aft is this ca@@ co@@ phony of men cou@@ gh@@ ing, and stone being broken with primitive tools.
Like the others, I wear a fl@@ ick@@ er@@ ing, cheap flash@@ light tied to my head with this el@@ as@@ tic, tat@@ tered b@@ and, and I can barely make out the slic@@ k tree lim@@ bs holding up the walls of the three-@@ foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth.
When my hand sli@@ ps, I suddenly remember a min@@ er I had met days before who had lost his gri@@ p and fell countless feet down that sh@@ af@@ t.
As I stand talking to you today, these men are still deep in that ho@@ le, ris@@ king their lives without pay@@ ment or compens@@ ation, and often dying.
I got to climb out of that ho@@ le, and I got to go home, but they likely never will, because they're trapped in slaver@@ y.
For the last 28 years, I've been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six contin@@ ents, and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the so@@ le exhi@@ bit@@ or at the Vancou@@ ver Peace Sum@@ m@@ it.
A@@ mon@@ g@@ st all the astonishing people I met there, I met a suppor@@ ter of Free the S@@ lav@@ es, an NG@@ O dedicated to eradic@@ ating modern day slaver@@ y.
We started talking about slaver@@ y, and really, I started learning about slaver@@ y, for I had certainly known it existed in the world, but not to such a degree.
After we finished talking, I felt so horrible and honest@@ ly ash@@ amed at my own lack of knowledge of this atroc@@ ity in my own lifetime, and I thought, if I don't know, how many other people don't know?
It started burning a hole in my stomach@@ , so within weeks, I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the S@@ lav@@ es and offer them my help.
Th@@ us began my journey into modern day slaver@@ y.
O@@ d@@ dly, I had been to many of these places before.
Some I even considered like my second home.
But this time, I would see the skelet@@ ons hidden in the clos@@ et.
A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people ens@@ lav@@ ed in the world today.
That's double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans@@ -@@ Atlantic sl@@ ave trade.
A hundred and fif@@ ty years ago, an agricultural sl@@ ave cost about three times the annual sal@@ ary of an American work@@ er.
That equ@@ ates to about $@@ 50,000 in today's money.
Yet today, entire families can be ens@@ lav@@ ed for generations over a debt as small as $@@ 18@@ .
A@@ st@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly, slavery generates profits of more than $@@ 13 billion worldwide each year.
Many have been tric@@ ked by false promises of a good education, a better job, only to find that they're forced to work without pay under the threat of violence, and they cannot walk away.
Tod@@ ay@@ 's slavery is about com@@ merc@@ e, so the goods that ens@@ lav@@ ed people produce have value, but the people producing them are dispos@@ able.
S@@ l@@ aver@@ y exists everywhere, near@@ ly, in the world, and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world.
In India and Nep@@ al, I was introduced to the br@@ ick kil@@ ns.
This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or D@@ ante@@ 's In@@ fer@@ no.
En@@ vel@@ oped in temperatures of 130 degrees, men, women, children, entire families in fact, were clo@@ aked in a heavy blank@@ et of d@@ ust, while mechan@@ ically stac@@ king br@@ icks on their head, up to 18 at a time, and carrying them from the s@@ cor@@ ching kil@@ ns to trucks hundreds of yar@@ ds away.
De@@ ad@@ ened by mon@@ ot@@ ony and exhaus@@ tion, they work sil@@ ently, doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no breaks for food, no water break@@ s, and the severe de@@ hydr@@ ation made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ consequ@@ enti@@ al.
So pervas@@ ive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ce@@ ased working.
Every 20 minutes, I'd have to run back to our cru@@ is@@ er to clean out my gear and run it under an air condition@@ er to re@@ vive it, and as I sat there, I thought, my camera is getting far better treatment than these people.
Back in the kil@@ ns, I wanted to cr@@ y, but the abol@@ i@@ tion@@ ist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said, "L@@ is@@ a, don't do that. Just don't do that here."
And he very clearly explained to me that emotional dis@@ plays are very dangerous in a place like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer them any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in.
I'd have to rely on Free the S@@ lav@@ es to work within the system for their liber@@ ation, and I trusted that they woul@@ d.
As for me, I'd have to wait until I got home to really feel my heart@@ break.
In the Himalay@@ as, I found children carrying stone for miles down mountain@@ ous ter@@ rain to trucks waiting at roads belo@@ w.
The big sheets of sl@@ ate were he@@ avi@@ er than the children carrying them, and the kids ho@@ is@@ ted them from their heads using these hand@@ made har@@ nesses of sticks and rope and tor@@ n clo@@ th.
It's difficult to witness something so overwhel@@ ming.
How can we affect something so ins@@ idi@@ ous, yet so pervas@@ i@@ ve?
Some don't even know they're ens@@ lav@@ ed, people working 16, 17 hours a day without any pa@@ y, because this has been the case all their lives.
They have nothing to compare it to.
When these vill@@ agers claimed their freedom, the slav@@ e@@ holders burned down all of their hous@@ es.
I mean, these people had nothing, and they were so pe@@ tri@@ fied, they wanted to give up, but the woman in the center r@@ alli@@ ed for them to persever@@ e, and abol@@ i@@ tion@@ ists on the ground helped them get a qu@@ arry lease of their own, so that now they do the same back@@ -@@ breaking work, but they do it for themselves, and they get paid for it, and they do it in freedom.
Se@@ x traffic@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word slaver@@ y, and because of this worldwide awar@@ eness, I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry.
In K@@ ath@@ mand@@ u, I was escor@@ ted by women who had previously been sex sl@@ aves themselves.
They us@@ her@@ ed me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dir@@ ty, dim@@ ly fluor@@ escent lit bas@@ ement.
This wasn't a bro@@ th@@ el, per se.
It was more like a restaur@@ ant.
Cab@@ in restaur@@ ants, as they're known in the trade, are venu@@ es for forced prostitu@@ tion.
Each has small, private rooms, where the slav@@ es, women, along with young girls and boys, some as young as seven years old, are forced to enter@@ tain the cli@@ ents, encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol@@ .
Each cub@@ ic@@ le is dark and d@@ ing@@ y, identified with a painted number on the wall, and parti@@ tioned by pl@@ y@@ wood and a cur@@ tain@@ .
The workers here often end@@ ure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their custo@@ mers.
St@@ anding in the near dark@@ ness, I remember feeling this qu@@ ick, hot fear, and in that inst@@ ant, I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that h@@ ell.
I had only one way out@@ : the stairs from where I'd come in.
There were no back do@@ ors.
There were no windows large enough to climb through.
These people have no escape at all, and as we take in such a difficult subject, it's important to note that slaver@@ y, including sex traffic@@ king, occurs in our own back@@ yard as well.
T@@ ens of hundreds of people are ens@@ lav@@ ed in agriculture, in restaur@@ ants, in domestic serv@@ itu@@ de, and the list can go on.
Rec@@ ently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 3@@ 00,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year.
It's all around us. We just don't see it.
The tex@@ tile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about sl@@ ave labor.
I visited villages in India where entire families were ens@@ lav@@ ed in the silk trade.
This is a family portra@@ it.
The dy@@ ed black hands are the father, while the blue and red hands are his son@@ s.
They mix dy@@ e in these big barrel@@ s, and they submer@@ ge the silk into the liquid up to their el@@ bo@@ ws, but the dy@@ e is tox@@ ic.
My interpre@@ ter told me their stories.
"We have no free@@ dom@@ ," they said.
"We hope still, though, that we could leave this house someday and go some@@ place else where we actually get paid for our d@@ ye@@ ing."
It's estimated that more than 4,000 children are ens@@ lav@@ ed on Lake Vol@@ ta, the largest man-@@ made lake in the world.
When we first arrived, I went to have a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat, two older brother@@ s, some younger kids, makes sense right?
W@@ r@@ ong. They were all ens@@ lav@@ ed.
Children are taken from their families and traffic@@ ked and van@@ ished, and they're forced to work endless hours on these boats on the la@@ ke, even though they do not know how to sw@@ im.
This young child is eight years old.
He was tre@@ m@@ bling when our boat approach@@ ed, frighten@@ ed it would run over his tiny cano@@ e.
He was pe@@ tri@@ fied he would be knocked in the water.
The skeletal tree lim@@ bs submer@@ ged in Lake Vol@@ ta often catch the fishing ne@@ ts, and we@@ ary, frighten@@ ed children are thrown into the water to un@@ te@@ ther the lines.
Many of them dro@@ wn.
For as long as he can rec@@ all, he's been forced to work on the la@@ ke.
Ter@@ ri@@ fied of his mas@@ ter, he will not run away, and since he's been treated with cruel@@ ty all his life, he passes that down to the younger sl@@ aves that he manag@@ es.
I met these boys at five in the morning, when they were h@@ aul@@ ing in the last of their ne@@ ts, but they had been working since 1 a.m.
In the cold, wind@@ y night.
And it's important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish.
I want to introduce you to Ko@@ fi@@ .
K@@ of@@ i was rescued from a fishing village.
I met him at a shelter where Free the S@@ lav@@ es rehabil@@ it@@ ates victims of slaver@@ y.
Here he's seen taking a bat@@ h at the well, pouring big buck@@ ets of water over his head, and the wonderful news is, as you and I are sitting here talking today, K@@ of@@ i has been reuni@@ ted with his family, and what's even better, his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe.
K@@ of@@ i is the embodi@@ ment of possibil@@ ity.
Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life?
D@@ ri@@ ving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the S@@ lav@@ es, a fellow abol@@ i@@ tion@@ ist on a mo@@ ped suddenly spe@@ d up to our cru@@ is@@ er and tap@@ ped on the window.
He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jung@@ le.
At the end of the road, he ur@@ ged us out of the car, and told the driver to quickly leav@@ e.
Then he pointed toward this barely visible foot@@ path, and said, "This is the path, this is the path. Go@@ ."
As we started down the path, we pushed aside the vin@@ es blocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in, found that the tra@@ il had become f@@ loo@@ ded by recent rain@@ s, so I ho@@ is@@ ted the photo gear above my head as we des@@ cen@@ ded into these waters up to my ch@@ est.
After another two hours of hi@@ king, the wind@@ ing tra@@ il abr@@ up@@ tly ended at a clear@@ ing, and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field, and all of them were full of ens@@ lav@@ ed people labor@@ ing.
Many women had children str@@ apped to their backs while they were pan@@ ning for gol@@ d, w@@ ading in water poison@@ ed by mer@@ cur@@ y.
Mer@@ cur@@ y is used in the extrac@@ tion process.
These min@@ ers are ens@@ lav@@ ed in a mine sh@@ aft in another part of Gh@@ ana.
When they came out of the sh@@ af@@ t, they were so@@ aking we@@ t from their own swe@@ at.
I remember looking into their ti@@ red, blood@@ shot eyes, for many of them had been underground for 72 hours.
The sh@@ af@@ ts are up to 300 feet deep, and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area, where the stone will be p@@ ounded so that they can extract the gol@@ d.
At first gl@@ ance, the p@@ ounding site seems full of powerful men, but when we look closer, we see some less fortunate working on the fr@@ ing@@ es, and children too.
All of them are victim to injur@@ y, illness and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this mus@@ cular person will end up like this one here, rac@@ ked with tuberculos@@ is and mer@@ cur@@ y poison@@ ing in just a few years.
This is Man@@ ur@@ u. When his father died, his uncle traffic@@ ked him to work with him in the min@@ es.
When his uncle died, Man@@ ur@@ u inheri@@ ted his un@@ cle@@ 's deb@@ t, which further forced him into being ens@@ lav@@ ed in the min@@ es.
When I met him, he had been working in the mines for 14 years, and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accid@@ ent, one so severe doctors say his leg should be amput@@ ated.
On top of that, Man@@ ur@@ u has tuberculos@@ is, yet he's still forced to work day in and day out in that mine sh@@ af@@ t.
Even still, he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the S@@ lav@@ es, and it's this sort of determin@@ ation, in the face of unimagin@@ able od@@ ds, that fil@@ ls me with complete aw@@ e.
I want to shine a light on slaver@@ y.
When I was working in the field, I brought lots of cand@@ les with me, and with the help of my interpre@@ ter, I im@@ par@@ ted to the people I was photograph@@ ing that I wanted to illumin@@ ate their stories and their p@@ light, so when it was safe for them, and safe for me, I made these images.
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world.
I wanted them to know that we will be be@@ aring witness to them, and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives.
I truly believe, if we can see one another as fellow human beings, then it becomes very difficult to toler@@ ate atroc@@ ities like slaver@@ y.
These images are not of issues. They are of people, real people, like you and me, all deser@@ ving of the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is not a day that goes by that I don't think of these many beautiful, mist@@ re@@ ated people I've had the tremendous honor of meeting.
I hope that these images awa@@ ken a force in those who view them, people like you, and I hope that force will ign@@ ite a fire, and that fire will shine a light on slaver@@ y, for without that light, the be@@ ast of bon@@ d@@ age can continue to live in the shado@@ ws.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Parkinson's disease affects 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide, causing weak@@ ness and tre@@ mor@@ s, but there's no objective way to detect it early on. Y@@ et. Ap@@ pli@@ ed mathematician and TED Fellow Max Little is testing a simple, cheap tool that in trials is able to detect Parkinson's with 99 percent accur@@ acy - in a 30-@@ second phone call.
Max L@@ it@@ t@@ le: A test for Parkinson's with a phone call.
So, well, I do applied math, and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math, is that we are like management consul@@ tant@@ s.
No one knows what the hell we do.
So I am going to give you some - attempt today to try and explain to you what I do.
So, dancing is one of the most human of activi@@ ties.
We del@@ ight at bal@@ let virtu@@ osos and tap dan@@ cers you will see later on.
Now, bal@@ let requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill@@ , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it.
Now, sad@@ ly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability, as it is doing to my friend J@@ an S@@ tri@@ pl@@ ing, who was a virtu@@ oso bal@@ let danc@@ er in his time.
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years.
However, there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease, and they have to live with incur@@ able weak@@ ness, tre@@ mor@@ , rig@@ id@@ ity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease, so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progression objec@@ tively, and ultimately, the only way we're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure.
But fr@@ us@@ trat@@ ingly, with Parkinson's disease and other movement disord@@ ers, there are no biom@@ ar@@ k@@ ers, so there's no simple blood test that you can do, and the best that we have is like this 20-@@ minute neur@@ ologist test.
You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very cost@@ ly, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, it's just never done. It's never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home@@ ?
Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clin@@ ic, and what if patients could do that test themselves, right?
No expensive staff time requi@@ red.
T@@ akes about $@@ 3@@ 00, by the way, in the neur@@ olog@@ ist@@ 's clinic to do it.
So what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this, because, you see, in one sense, at least, we are all virtu@@ osos like my friend J@@ an S@@ tri@@ pl@@ ing.
So here we have a video of the vibr@@ ating vocal fol@@ ds.
Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds, and we can think of ourselves as vocal bal@@ let dan@@ cer@@ s, because we have to coordin@@ ate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds, and we all actually have the genes for it. Fo@@ x@@ P@@ 2, for example.
And like bal@@ let, it takes an extraordinary level of training.
I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates, and just as the lim@@ bs are affected in Parkin@@ son@@ 's, so too are the vocal organs.
So on the bottom trac@@ e, you can see an example of ir@@ regular vocal fold tre@@ mor@@ .
We see all the same symptom@@ s.
We see vocal tre@@ mor@@ , weak@@ ness and rig@@ id@@ ity.
The speech actually becomes qui@@ e@@ ter and more breath@@ y after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it.
So these vocal effects can actually be quite sub@@ tle, in some cases, but with any digital micro@@ phone, and using precis@@ ion voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning, which is very advanced by now, we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continu@@ um between health and disease using voice signals alone.
So these voic@@ e-@@ based test@@ s, how do they stack up against expert clinical test@@ s? We@@ '@@ l@@ l, they're both non-@@ inv@@ asi@@ ve.
The neur@@ olog@@ ist@@ 's test is non-@@ inv@@ asi@@ ve. They both use existing infrastructure.
You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it.
And they're both accur@@ ate. Okay, but in addition, voic@@ e-@@ based tests are non-@@ exper@@ t.
That means they can be self-@@ adminis@@ ter@@ ed.
They're high-@@ speed, take about 30 seconds at most.
They're ultra-@@ low cost, and we all know what happens.
When something becomes ultra-@@ low cost, it becomes massively scal@@ able.
So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now.
We can reduce logis@@ tical difficul@@ ties with patients.
No need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up.
We can do high-@@ frequency monitoring to get objective data.
We can perform low-cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials, and we can make popul@@ ation-@@ scale screening fe@@ asi@@ ble for the first time.
We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it's too late.
So, taking the first steps towards this today, we're launching the Parkinson's Voice I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative.
With A@@ cul@@ ab and Pati@@ ent@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ M@@ e, we're aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four go@@ als.
We have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet.
Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, che@@ apl@@ y, and leave recor@@ d@@ ings, a few cents e@@ ach, and I'm really happy to ann@@ ounce that we've already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours.
Thank you. Tom Ri@@ ell@@ y: So M@@ ax@@ , by taking all these samples of, let's say, 10,000 people, you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to get out of those sam@@ pl@@ es?
Max L@@ it@@ t@@ le: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that, during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not, you see. T@@ R: Right.
M@@ L: You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it.
But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumst@@ ances, and it's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at iron@@ ing out the conf@@ ounding factor@@ s, and looking for the actual mark@@ ers of the disease.
T@@ R: So you're 86 percent accurate right now?
M@@ L: It's much better than that.
Actually, my student Than@@ as@@ is, I have to plug him, because he's done some fantastic work, and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well, which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accur@@ acy.
T@@ R: Nin@@ et@@ y-@@ n@@ ine. Well, that's an improv@@ ement.
So what that means is that people will be able to — M@@ L: T@@ R: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in, record their voice, and then their doctor can check up on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease.
M@@ L: Absolu@@ tely.
T@@ R: Thanks so much. Max L@@ it@@ tle, everybody.
M@@ L: Than@@ ks, T@@ om.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In the wake of the 201@@ 1 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, mixed into the w@@ reck@@ age were lost and dam@@ aged photos of families and loved ones. Pho@@ to re@@ touch@@ er B@@ ec@@ ci M@@ ans@@ on, together with local volunteers and a global group of colleagues she recru@@ ited online, helped clean and fix them, restor@@ ing those memories to their own@@ ers.
B@@ ec@@ ci M@@ ans@@ on: touching lives through pho@@ tos.
Before Mar@@ ch, 2011, I was a photograph@@ ic re@@ touch@@ er based in New York City.
We're pal@@ e, gray creatures.
We hide in dark, windo@@ w@@ less rooms, and generally avoid sun@@ light.
We make skin@@ ny models skin@@ ni@@ er, perfect skin more perfect, and the impossible possible, and we get critici@@ zed in the press all the time, but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photograph@@ y.
On March 11, 2011, I watched from home, as the rest of the world did, as the tragic events un@@ folded in Japan.
So@@ on after, an organization I volunteer with, All H@@ ands Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers, were on the ground, within days, working as part of the response effor@@ ts.
I, along with hundreds of other volunte@@ ers, knew we couldn't just sit at home, so I decided to join them for three weeks.
On May the 13@@ th, I made my way to the town of Ō@@ fun@@ ato.
It's a small fishing town in I@@ w@@ ate Pre@@ fec@@ ture, about 50,000 people, one of the first that was hit by the wav@@ e.
The waters here have been recorded at reaching over 24 meters in he@@ ight, and traveled over two miles in@@ land.
As you can imagine, the town had been devas@@ ta@@ ted.
We pulled debr@@ is from can@@ als and dit@@ ches.
We clean@@ ed schools. We de-@@ mud@@ ded and gu@@ t@@ ted homes ready for renov@@ ation and rehabil@@ it@@ ation.
We clear@@ ed tons and tons of st@@ in@@ king, rot@@ ting fish car@@ c@@ asses from the local fish processing plant.
We got dir@@ ty, and we loved it.
For weeks, all the volunteers and loc@@ als ali@@ ke had been finding similar things.
They'd been finding photos and photo al@@ bum@@ s and cameras and S@@ D cards.
And everyone was doing the same.
They were collecting them up, and hand@@ ing them in to various places around the different towns for safe@@ keep@@ ing.
Now, it wasn't until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had fel@@ t.
As they had run from the wave, and for their lives, absolutely everything they had, everything had to be left behind.
At the end of my first week there, I found myself helping out in an evacu@@ ation center in the town.
I was helping clean the on@@ sen@@ , the commun@@ al on@@ sen@@ , the huge giant bath@@ tub@@ s.
This happened to also be a place in the town where the evacu@@ ation center was collecting the pho@@ tos.
This is where people were hand@@ ing them in, and I was honor@@ ed that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand-@@ cleaning them.
Now, it was emotional and it was inspir@@ ing, and I've always heard about thinking outside the box, but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened.
As I looked through the pho@@ tos, there were some were over a hundred years old, some still in the envelope from the processing lab, I couldn't help but think as a re@@ touch@@ er that I could fix that tear and men@@ d that scrat@@ ch, and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that evening, I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them, and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive, I knew we had to give it a go.
So we started re@@ touching pho@@ tos.
This was the very first.
Not terribly dam@@ ag@@ ed, but where the water had caused that dis@@ color@@ ation on the girl@@ 's face had to be re@@ paired with such accur@@ acy and delic@@ acy.
Other@@ wise, that little girl isn't going to look like that little girl anymore, and surely that's as tragic as having the photo dam@@ ag@@ ed.
Over time, more photos came in, thank@@ fully, and more re@@ touch@@ ers were nee@@ ded, and so I reached out again on Facebook and Lin@@ k@@ ed@@ In@@ , and within five days, 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people wanting to join in.
Within Japan, by Jul@@ y, we'd bran@@ ched out to the neighbor@@ ing town of R@@ ik@@ uz@@ ent@@ ak@@ ata, further north to a town called Y@@ am@@ ada.
Once a week, we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libr@@ aries that had been set up, where people were re@@ claim@@ ing their pho@@ tos.
The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before, but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo, they could give it to us, have it scan@@ ned, uplo@@ aded to a cloud ser@@ ver, it would be down@@ loaded by a ga@@ ij@@ in, a strang@@ er, somewhere on the other side of the globe, and it@@ 'd start being fix@@ ed.
The time it to@@ ok, however, to get it back is a completely different story, and it depen@@ ded obviously on the damage involved.
It could take an hour. It could take weeks.
It could take months.
The k@@ im@@ on@@ o in this shot pretty much had to be hand-@@ dra@@ wn, or piec@@ ed together, picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn't dam@@ ag@@ ed.
It was very time-@@ consum@@ ing.
Now, all these photos had been dam@@ aged by water, submer@@ ged in salt water, covered in bacteria, in se@@ w@@ age, sometimes even in oil, all of which over time is going to continue to damage them, so hand-@@ cleaning them was a huge part of the project.
We couldn't re@@ touch the photo unless it was clean@@ ed, dry and re@@ cl@@ ai@@ med.
Now, we were lucky with our hand-@@ clean@@ ing.
We had an amazing local woman who guid@@ ed us.
It's very easy to do more damage to those dam@@ aged pho@@ tos.
As my team leader W@@ yn@@ ne once said, it's like doing a tat@@ too on some@@ one.
You don't get a chance to mess it up.
The lady who brought us these photos was lucky, as far as the photos go.
She had started hand-@@ cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage.
She also had duplic@@ ates.
Are@@ as like her husband and her face, which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fi@@ x, we could just put them together in one good photo, and re@@ make the whole pho@@ to.
When she collected the photos from us, she shared a bit of her story with us.
Her photos were found by her husband@@ 's colleagues at a local fire department in the debr@@ is a long way from where the home had once sto@@ od, and they'd recognized him.
The day of the tsunami, he'd actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami g@@ ates were clos@@ ed.
He had to go towards the water as the sir@@ ens s@@ oun@@ ded.
Her two little boys, not so little anymore, but her two boys were both at school, separate schools.
One of them got caught up in the water.
It took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survi@@ ved.
The day I gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son's 14@@ th birth@@ day.
For her, despite all of this, those photos were the perfect gift back to him, something he could look at again, something he remembered from before that wasn't still scar@@ red from that day in March when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroy@@ ed.
After six months in Japan, 1,@@ 100 volunteers had passed through All Hand@@ s, hundreds of whom had helped us hand-@@ clean over 13@@ 5,000 photographs, the large majority — — a large majority of which did actually find their home again, important@@ ly.
Over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back, fully restor@@ ed and re@@ touch@@ ed.
During this time, we hadn't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials, most of which was printer in@@ ks.
We take photos const@@ ant@@ ly.
A photo is a remin@@ der of someone or something, a place, a relationship, a loved one.
They're our memor@@ y-@@ keepers and our histori@@ es, the last thing we would grab and the first thing you'd go back to look for.
That's all this project was about, about restor@@ ing those little bits of humanity, giving someone that connection back.
When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this, it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it.
The projec@@ t's also made a big difference in the lives of the re@@ touch@@ ers.
For some of them, it's given them a connection to something bigger, giving something back, using their talents on something other than skin@@ ny models and perfect skin.
I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them, C@@ ind@@ y, the day I finally got back from Japan after six months.
"As I worked, I couldn't help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images.
One in particular, a photo of women of all ages, from grandmother to little girl, gathered around a baby, struck a chor@@ d, because a similar photo from my family, my grandmother and mother, myself, and new@@ born daughter, hang@@ s on our wall.
A@@ cross the globe, throughout the ages, our basic needs are just the same, aren't they@@ ?"
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Ram@@ esh R@@ ask@@ ar presents fem@@ to-@@ photograph@@ y, a new type of imaging so fast it visualiz@@ es the world one trillion frames per second, so detailed it shows light itself in motion. This technology may someday be used to build cameras that can look “@@ ar@@ ound@@ ” cor@@ ners or see inside the body without X-@@ r@@ ay@@ s.
Ram@@ esh R@@ ask@@ ar: Imag@@ ing at a trillion frames per second.
Do@@ c Ed@@ ger@@ ton inspired us with a@@ we and curiosity with this photo of a bullet pi@@ er@@ c@@ ing through an ap@@ ple, and exposure just a million@@ th of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million or a billion, but one trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new type of photograph@@ y, fem@@ to-@@ photograph@@ y, a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can look around cor@@ ners, beyond line of s@@ ight, or see inside our body without an x-@@ ra@@ y, and really challenge what we mean by a camera.
Now if I take a laser poin@@ ter and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second - which is several fem@@ tos@@ econ@@ ds - I'll create a pac@@ ket of pho@@ tons barely a milli@@ meter wid@@ e.
And that pac@@ ket of pho@@ ton@@ s, that bul@@ let, will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than an ordinary bul@@ let.
Now, if you take that bullet and take this pac@@ ket of pho@@ tons and fire into this bot@@ tle, how will those pho@@ tons shat@@ ter into this bott@@ le?
How does light look in slow mo@@ tion?
[@@ L@@ ight in S@@ low Mo@@ tion ... 10 Bil@@ lion x S@@ low@@ ] Now, the whole event - Now remember, the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanos@@ econ@@ d - that's how much time it takes for light to travel@@ .
But I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion, so you can see the light in motion.
But Coca-Cola did not spon@@ sor this research.
Now, there's a lot going on in this movie, so let me break this down and show you what's going on.
So the pulse enters the bot@@ tle, our bul@@ let, with a pac@@ ket of pho@@ tons that start traveling through and that start scat@@ tering inside.
Some of the light le@@ ak@@ s, goes on the table, and you start seeing these ri@@ p@@ ples of waves.
Many of the pho@@ tons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air and it's bounc@@ ing around inside.
Meanwhile, the ri@@ p@@ ples are traveling on the table, and because of the reflec@@ tions at the top, you see at the back of the bot@@ tle, after several fr@@ am@@ es, the reflec@@ tions are foc@@ used.
Now, if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video - again, by a factor of 10 billion - do you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movi@@ e?
A day, a week@@ ? Actually, a whole year.
It'll be a very boring movie - of a slow, ordinary bullet in motion.
And what about some stil@@ l-@@ life photograph@@ y?
You can watch the ri@@ p@@ ples, again, washing over the table, the toma@@ to and the wall in the back.
It's like throwing a stone in a pon@@ d of water.
I though@@ t: this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo, one fem@@ to frame at a time, but of course our eye sees an integral com@@ posi@@ te.
But if you look at this toma@@ to one more time, you will notice, as the light was@@ hes over the toma@@ to, it continues to g@@ low.
It doesn't become dark. Why is that? Because the toma@@ to is actually ri@@ pe, and the light is bounc@@ ing around inside the toma@@ to, and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second.
So in the future, when this fem@@ to-@@ camera is in your camera phone, you might be able to go to a super@@ market and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it.
So how did my team at MIT create this camer@@ a?
Now, as photograp@@ her@@ s, you know, if you take a short exposure photo, you get very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than your shor@@ test expos@@ ure, so you're going to get hardly any light.
So what we do is we send that bullet - that pac@@ ket of pho@@ tons - millions of times, and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ iz@@ ation, and from the gig@@ abytes of data, we comput@@ ation@@ ally we@@ ave together to create those fem@@ to-@@ videos I showed you.
And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways.
So, Super@@ man can fly.
Some other heroes can become invisible.
But what about a new power for a future super@@ her@@ o: To see around cor@@ ners.
The idea is that we could shine some light on the door, it's going to boun@@ ce, go inside the room, some of that is going to reflect back on the door, and then back to the camera.
And we could exploit these multiple bounc@@ es of light.
And it's not science fic@@ tion. We have actually built it.
On the left, you see our fem@@ to-@@ camera.
There's a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall, and we're going to b@@ ounce light off the door.
So after our paper was published in Nature Com@@ munic@@ ations, it was high@@ ligh@@ ted by Nature@@ .com, and they created this anima@@ tion.
Ram@@ esh R@@ ask@@ ar: We're going to fire those bul@@ lets of light, and they're going to hit this wall, and because of the pac@@ ket of the pho@@ ton@@ s, they will scat@@ ter in all the direc@@ tions, and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in, which in turn will again scat@@ ter that light, and again in turn, the door will reflect some of that scat@@ tered light.
And a tiny fraction of the pho@@ tons will actually come back to the camera, but most interestingly, they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot.
And because we have a camera that can run so fast - our fem@@ to-@@ camera - it has some unique abilities.
It has very good time resolu@@ tion, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And this way, we know the dist@@ ances, of course to the door, but also to the hidden objects, but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance.
By shining one las@@ er, we can record one raw photo, which, if you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense.
But then we will take a lot of such pictures, dozens of such pictures, put them together, and try to analyze the multiple bounc@@ es of light, and from that, can we see the hidden objec@@ t?
Can we see it in full 3@@ D@@ ?
So this is our re@@ construc@@ tion.
Now, we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collis@@ ions with what's around the b@@ end.
Or we can look for surviv@@ ors in haz@@ ard@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windo@@ ws.
Or we can build end@@ os@@ cop@@ es that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders, and also for cardi@@ os@@ cop@@ es.
But of course, because of tissue and blood, this is quite challeng@@ ing, so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to-@@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health@@ -@@ imaging problems.
Now, like Do@@ c Ed@@ ger@@ ton, a scientist himself, science became art - an art of ultra-@@ fast photograph@@ y.
And I realized that all the gig@@ abytes of data that we're collecting every time, are not just for scientific imag@@ ing.
But we can also do a new form of computational photograph@@ y, with time-lap@@ se and color co@@ ding.
And we look at those ri@@ p@@ ples. Re@@ member@@ : The time between each of those ri@@ p@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second.
But there's also something funny going on here.
When you look at the ri@@ p@@ ples under the cap@@ , the ri@@ p@@ ples are moving away from us.
The ri@@ p@@ ples should be moving towards us.
What's going on here?
It turns out, because we're recording nearly at the speed of light, we have strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The order at which events take place in the world appears in the camera sometimes in rever@@ sed order.
So by applying the correspon@@ ding space and time war@@ p, we can correct for this distor@@ tion.
So whether it's for photography around cor@@ ners, or creating the next generation of health imag@@ ing, or creating new visualiz@@ ations, since our inven@@ tion, we have open-@@ sourc@@ ed all the data and details on our website, and our hope is that the DI@@ Y, the creative and the research communities will show us that we should stop obsess@@ ing about the meg@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras.
And start focusing on the next dimension in imag@@ ing.
It's about time. Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What kind of data is your cell phone company collec@@ t@@ ing? Mal@@ te S@@ pit@@ z was@@ n’t too worried when he asked his oper@@ ator in Germany to share information stored about him. M@@ ulti@@ ple un@@ answered request@@ s and a law@@ suit later, S@@ pit@@ z received 3@@ 5,@@ 8@@ 30 lines of code - a deta@@ ile@@ d, nearly minu@@ te-@@ by-@@ minute account of half a year of his life.
Mal@@ te S@@ pit@@ z: Your phone company is watch@@ ing.
H@@ i. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change your life, and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, you can shoot a crime against humanity in Sy@@ ria.
With a mobile phone, you can twe@@ et a message and start a protest in Egyp@@ t.
And with a mobile phone, you can record a song, load it up to S@@ ound@@ C@@ loud and become fam@@ ous.
All this is possible with your mobile phone.
I'm a child of 1984, and I live in the city of Ber@@ lin@@ .
Let's go back to that time, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and pro@@ tested for change.
This is aut@@ um@@ n 1989, and imagine that all those people standing up and protest@@ ing for change had a mobile phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you?
H@@ old it up.
H@@ old your phones up, hold your phones up@@ !
H@@ old it up. An Andro@@ id, a Black@@ berr@@ y, wo@@ w.
That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.
But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone, and how it changed my life.
And I will talk about this.
These are 3@@ 5,@@ 8@@ 30 lines of information.
Ra@@ w data.
And why are these informa@@ tions there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.@@ U. Com@@ mission tab@@ led a direc@@ tive.
This direc@@ tive [@@ is@@ ] called D@@ ata R@@ et@@ ention Direc@@ tive.
This direc@@ tive says that each phone company in Europe, each Internet service company all over Europe, has to store a wide range of information about the users.
Who calls wh@@ om@@ ? Who sends whom an ema@@ il@@ ?
Who sends whom a text mess@@ age?
And if you use your mobile phone, where you are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provid@@ er.
And all over Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said, we don't want this data re@@ ten@@ tion.
We want self-@@ determin@@ ation in the digital age, and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us.
They were lawy@@ ers, journal@@ ists, pri@@ est@@ s, they all sa@@ id: "We don't want this."
And here you can see, like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of Ber@@ lin and said, "@@ Free@@ dom, not fe@@ ar."
And some even said, this would be St@@ as@@ i 2.@@ 0.
St@@ as@@ i was the secret police in East Germany.
And I also ask myself, does it really work?
Can they really store all this information about us?
Every time I use my mobile ph@@ one?
So I asked my phone company, De@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Tele@@ k@@ om, which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, send me all the information you have stored about me.
And I asked them once, and I asked them again, and I got no real answer. It was only bl@@ ah bl@@ ah answers.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because this is my life you are protocol@@ ing.
So I decided to start a law@@ suit against them, because I wanted to have this information.
But De@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Tele@@ k@@ om said, no, we will not give you this information.
So at the end, I had a settle@@ ment with them.
I'll put down the law@@ suit and they will send me all the information I ask for.
Because in the mean time, the German Constitu@@ tional Court ru@@ led that the implement@@ ation of this E.@@ U. direc@@ tive into German law was un@@ constitu@@ tion@@ al.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a C.@@ D. inside.
And on the C.@@ D@@ ., this was on.
Thir@@ ty-@@ five thousand eight hundred thir@@ ty lines of information.
At first I saw it, and I said, okay, it's a huge fi@@ le. Okay.
But then after a while I realized, this is my life.
This is six months of my life, into this fi@@ le.
So I was a little bit skep@@ tic@@ al, what should I do with it?
Because you can see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I am doing.
But then I said, I want to go out with this information.
I want to make them public.
Because I want to show the people what does data ret@@ ention mean.
So together with Ze@@ it On@@ line and Open D@@ ata City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can wind back and fast forward.
You can see every step I take.
And you can even see how I go from Frank@@ fur@@ t by train to C@@ olog@@ ne, and how often I call in between.
All this is possible with this information.
That's a little bit scar@@ y.
But it is not only about me.
It's about all of us.
First, it's only like, I call my wife and she calls me, and we talk to each other a couple of times.
And then there are some friends calling me, and they call each other.
And after a while you are calling you, and you are calling you, and you have this great communication network.
But you can see how your people are communicating with each other, what times they call each other, when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You can see the hub@@ s, like who are the leaders in the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what your society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a blue@@ print for countries like China and Iran@@ .
This is a blue@@ print how to survey your society, because you know who talks to wh@@ om, who sends whom an email, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe, up to two years.
Like I said at the beginning, imagine that all those people on the streets of Ber@@ lin in aut@@ um@@ n of 198@@ 9 had a mobile phone in their pocket.
And the St@@ as@@ i would have known who took part at this protest@@ , and if the St@@ as@@ i would have known who are the leaders behind it, this may never have happened.
The fall of the Ber@@ lin Wall would maybe not [@@ have be@@ en@@ ] there.
And in the after@@ math, also not the fall of the Ir@@ on Cur@@ tain@@ .
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us, online and of@@ fl@@ ine.
They want to have the possibility to track our lives, and they want to store them for all time.
But self-@@ determin@@ ation and living in the digital age is no contradic@@ tion.
But you have to fight for your self-@@ determin@@ ation today.
You have to fight for it every day.
So, when you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not out@@ d@@ ated.
When you go home, tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company what information they store about you.
So, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone, let it be a remin@@ der to you that you have to fight for self-@@ determin@@ ation in the digital age.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: "I have cerebral pal@@ s@@ y. I shake all the time@@ ," May@@ soon Z@@ ay@@ id announc@@ es at the beginning of this ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating, hilari@@ ous talk. "I'm like Shak@@ ira meets Muhammad Ali@@ ." With gr@@ ace and wit@@ , the Arab@@ -@@ American comedi@@ an takes us on a whist@@ le-@@ stop tour of her advent@@ ures as an ac@@ tr@@ ess, stand-up com@@ ic, philanthrop@@ ist and advocate for the disab@@ led.
May@@ soon Z@@ ay@@ id: I got 99 problems ... pal@@ sy is just one.
Hell@@ o, TED@@ Women, what's up.
Not good enough.
Hell@@ o, TED@@ Women, what is up?
My name is May@@ soon Z@@ ay@@ id, and I am not dr@@ un@@ k, but the doctor who delivered me was.
He cut my mom six different times in six different direc@@ tions, suf@@ foc@@ ating poor little me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral pal@@ s@@ y, which means I shake all the time.
Loo@@ k.
It's exha@@ ust@@ ing.
I'm like Shak@@ ira, Shak@@ ira meets Muhammad Ali@@ .
C@@ P is not gene@@ tic.
It's not a birth defec@@ t. You can't catch it.
No one put a cur@@ se on my mother's u@@ ter@@ us, and I didn't get it because my parents are first cous@@ ins, which they are.
It only happens from accid@@ ents, like what happened to me on my birth day.
Now, I must war@@ n you, I'm not inspir@@ ation@@ al.
And I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me, because at some point in your life, you have dream@@ t of being disab@@ led.
Come on a journey with me.
It's Christmas E@@ ve, you're at the m@@ all, you're driving around in circles looking for par@@ king, and what do you see?
Six@@ teen empty hand@@ ic@@ apped spaces.
And you're like, "G@@ od, can't I just be a little disab@@ led@@ ?"
Also, I've got to tell you, I've got 99 problems, and pal@@ sy is just one.
If there was an Op@@ pression Olympic@@ s, I would win the gold med@@ al.
I'm Palestin@@ i@@ an, Musli@@ m, I'm femal@@ e, I'm disab@@ led, and I live in New Jerse@@ y.
If you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you shoul@@ d.
C@@ lif@@ f@@ side Park, New Jerse@@ y is my home@@ town.
I have always loved the fact that my hood and my af@@ flic@@ tion share the same initi@@ als.
I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I could.
A lot of people with C@@ P don't walk, but my parents didn't believe in "@@ can@@ '@@ t."
My father's mantra was, "You can do it, yes you can can@@ ."
So, if my three older sisters were mo@@ pp@@ ing, I was mo@@ pp@@ ing.
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents would su@@ e the school system and guarantee that I went too, and if we didn't all get A@@ 's, we all got my mother's sli@@ p@@ per.
My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by plac@@ ing my he@@ els on his feet and just wal@@ king.
Another tac@@ tic that he used is he would dang@@ le a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it.
My inner stri@@ p@@ per was very strong.
Yeah. No, by the first day of kindergar@@ ten, I was walking like a cham@@ p who had been pun@@ ched one too many times.
Gro@@ wing up, there were only six Arab@@ s in my town, and they were all my family.
Now there are 20 Arab@@ s in town, and they are still all my family. I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Ital@@ i@@ an.
This was before 9/11 and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use "I hate Muslim@@ s" as a campaign slogan@@ .
The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
They did, however, seem very concerned that I would star@@ ve to death during Ram@@ ad@@ an.
I would explain to them that I have enough fat to live off of for three whole months, so fas@@ ting from sun@@ rise to sun@@ set is a piece of ca@@ ke.
I have tap@@ -@@ d@@ anced on Broad@@ way.
Yeah, on Broad@@ way. It's crazy. My parents couldn't afford physical therap@@ y, so they sent me to dancing school.
I learned how to dance in he@@ els, which means I can walk in he@@ els.
And I'm from Jerse@@ y, and we are really concerned with being ch@@ ic, so if my friends wore he@@ els, so did I.
And when my friends went and spent their summer vac@@ ations on the Jerse@@ y S@@ hor@@ e, I did not.
I spent my sum@@ mers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palest@@ ine every single summer, we'd grow up to be Mad@@ on@@ n@@ a.
Sum@@ mer vac@@ ations often cons@@ is@@ ted of my father trying to heal me, so I dr@@ ank de@@ er's mil@@ k, I had hot cup@@ s on my back, I was dun@@ ked in the De@@ ad Se@@ a, and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking, "It's work@@ ing@@ ! It's work@@ ing@@ !"
But one miracle cure we did find was yog@@ a.
I have to tell you, it's very bor@@ ing, but before I did yog@@ a, I was a stand-up comedi@@ an who can't stand up.
And now I can stand on my head.
My parents rein@@ forced this notion that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be on the day@@ time soap opera "G@@ ener@@ al Hos@@ pit@@ al."
I went to college during af@@ fir@@ ma@@ tive action and got a sweet scholar@@ ship to AS@@ U, Ari@@ zona State University, because I fit every single quot@@ a.
I was like the pet le@@ mu@@ r of the theater depart@@ ment.
Everybody loved me.
I did all the less@@ -@@ th@@ an-@@ intelligent kid@@ s' home@@ work, I got A's in all of my class@@ es, A's in all of their class@@ es.
Every time I did a scene from "The Gl@@ ass Men@@ ag@@ eri@@ e," my professors would we@@ ep.
But I never got cas@@ t.
Finally, my senior year, AS@@ U decided to do a show called "@@ They D@@ ance Real S@@ low in Jack@@ son@@ ."
It's a play about a girl with C@@ P.
I was a girl with C@@ P.
So I start sh@@ ou@@ ting from the roof@@ top@@ s, "I'm finally going to get a part@@ !
I have cerebral pal@@ sy@@ !
Free at l@@ ast@@ ! Free at l@@ ast@@ !
Thank God al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty, I'm free at l@@ ast@@ !"
I didn't get the part. Sher@@ ry Brown got the part.
I went racing to the head of the theater department crying hy@@ ster@@ ically, like someone shot my cat@@ , to ask her why, and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stun@@ ts.
I said, "@@ Excuse me, if I can't do the stun@@ ts, neither can the character@@ ."
This was a part that I was literally born to play they gave it to a non-@@ pal@@ sy ac@@ tr@@ ess.
College was imit@@ ating life.
Hollywood has a sor@@ did history of cas@@ ting ab@@ le-@@ bodi@@ ed actors to play disab@@ led on@@ screen.
Up@@ on gradu@@ ating, I moved back home, and my first acting gi@@ g was as an extra on a day@@ time soap oper@@ a.
My dream was coming true.
And I knew that I would be promo@@ ted from "D@@ in@@ er D@@ iner@@ " to "W@@ ack@@ y Best Fri@@ end@@ " in no time.
But instead, I remained a glori@@ fied piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head, and it became clear to me that cas@@ ting direc@@ tors didn't hire flu@@ ff@@ y, ethnic@@ , disab@@ led ac@@ tors.
They only hired perfect people.
But there were excep@@ tions to the rule.
I grew up watching Who@@ op@@ i Gold@@ berg, Ros@@ e@@ anne Barr@@ , El@@ len, and all of these women had one thing in common@@ : they were comedi@@ ans.
So I became a com@@ ic.
My first gi@@ g was driving famous com@@ ics from New York City to shows in New Jerse@@ y, and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove when he realized that he was spe@@ eding down the New Jerse@@ y Tur@@ n@@ pi@@ ke with a ch@@ ick with C@@ P driving him.
I've performed in clu@@ bs all over America, and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East, un@@ censor@@ ed and un@@ cover@@ ed.
Some people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world.
I never like to claim first, but I do know that they never heard that nasty little rum@@ or that women aren't funny, and they find us hy@@ ster@@ ical.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father Dean O@@ be@@ id@@ all@@ ah and I started the New York Arab@@ -@@ American Co@@ med@@ y Festiv@@ al, now in its 10@@ th year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab@@ -@@ Americans in media, while also remin@@ ding cas@@ ting direc@@ tors that South Asian and Arab are not sy@@ non@@ ym@@ ous.
M@@ ain@@ stre@@ aming Arab@@ s was much, much easier than con@@ quer@@ ing the challenge against the stig@@ ma against dis@@ ability.
My big break came in 2010.
I was invited to be a gu@@ est on the cable news show "C@@ oun@@ t@@ down with Keith Ol@@ ber@@ man@@ n@@ ."
I walked in looking like I was going to the pro@@ m, and they shu@@ ff@@ le me into a studio and seat me on a spin@@ ning, rolling chair.
So I looked at the stage manager and I'm like, "@@ Excuse me, can I have another chair@@ ?"
And she looked at me and she went, "F@@ ive, four, three, two ..."
And we were live, right?
So I had to gri@@ p onto the an@@ chor@@ 's desk so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the seg@@ ment, and when the interview was over, I was li@@ vid@@ .
I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it, and I knew I would never get invited back.
But not only did Mr. Ol@@ ber@@ mann invite me back, he made me a full-time contribut@@ or, and he ta@@ ped down my chair.
One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Ol@@ ber@@ mann was that humans on the Internet are s@@ c@@ umb@@ ag@@ s.
People say children are cru@@ el, but I was never made fun of as a child or an adul@@ t.
Sudden@@ ly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game.
I would look at clips online and see comments like, "Y@@ o, wh@@ y's she twe@@ a@@ kin@@ '@@ ?"
"Y@@ o, is she retar@@ ded@@ ?"
And my favori@@ te, "@@ Po@@ or G@@ umb@@ y-@@ mouth terror@@ ist.
What does she suffer from?
We should really pr@@ ay for her@@ ."
One comm@@ enter even suggested that I add my disability to my cre@@ dit@@ s: scre@@ en@@ writer, comedi@@ an, pal@@ s@@ y.
Dis@@ ability is as visual as race.
If a wheelchair user can't play B@@ ey@@ on@@ cé@@ , then B@@ ey@@ on@@ c@@ é can't play a wheelchair us@@ er.
The disab@@ led are the largest — Yeah, cl@@ ap for that, man. Come on.
People with dis@@ abilities are the largest minority in the world, and we are the most under@@ represented in entertain@@ ment.
The doctors said that I wouldn't walk, but I am here in front of you.
However, if I grew up with social media, I don't think I would be.
I hope that together, we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Perhaps if there were more positive images, it would foster less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well.
My cro@@ o@@ ked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places.
I got to walk the red carpet fl@@ an@@ ked by soap di@@ va Susan Luc@@ ci and the iconic L@@ ore@@ en Ar@@ bus@@ .
I got to act in a movie with Adam Sand@@ ler and work with my id@@ ol, the amazing Dave Matthe@@ ws.
I tou@@ red the world as a head@@ lin@@ er on Arab@@ s G@@ one Wil@@ d.
I was a deleg@@ ate representing the great state of New Jerse@@ y at the 2008 DN@@ C.
And I founded May@@ so@@ on's K@@ ids, a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children a sli@@ ver of the chance my parents gave me.
But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got - before this moment - But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who flo@@ ats like a butter@@ fly and st@@ ings like a be@@ e, has Parkinson's and sha@@ kes just like me, Muhammad Ali@@ .
It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live, and I dedic@@ ate this talk to his memory.
Al@@ la@@ h y@@ er@@ ham@@ ak y@@ ab@@ a.
My name is May@@ soon Z@@ ay@@ id, and if I can can, you can can.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For the young and un@@ employed in the world's big cities, dreams of opportunity and wealth do come true - but too often because they're heavily recru@@ ited by terrorist groups and other violent organizations. Human rights advocate Moham@@ ed Ali draws on stories from his native M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u to make a powerful case for innovation incub@@ ators for our ci@@ ti@@ es' young and ambi@@ ti@@ ous.
Moham@@ ed Ali@@ : The link between unemploy@@ ment and terrorism.
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid.
I don't know his name, but I do know his story.
He lives in a small village in southern Somali@@ a.
His village is near M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ hu@@ .
Dr@@ ought drives the small village into poverty and to the brin@@ k of star@@ v@@ ation.
With nothing left for him there, he leaves for the big city, in this case, M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ hu@@ , the capital of Somali@@ a.
When he arri@@ ves, there are no opportuni@@ ties, no jobs, no way forward.
He ends up living in a tent city on the out@@ skir@@ ts of M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ hu@@ .
Maybe a year pass@@ es, nothing.
One day, he's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lun@@ ch, then to din@@ ner, to break@@ fast.
He meets this dynamic group of people, and they give him a break.
He's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes, money to send back home to his family.
He is introduced to this young woman.
He eventually gets marri@@ ed.
He starts this new life.
He has a purpose in life.
One beautiful day in M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ hu@@ , under an az@@ ure blue sky, a car bomb goes off.
That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomb@@ er, and that dynamic group of people were al Sh@@ ab@@ a@@ ab@@ , a terrorist organization linked to al Qa@@ ed@@ a.
So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up?
He was wait@@ ing.
He was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to begin his future, waiting for a way forward, and this was the first thing that came along.
This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call wai@@ tho@@ od.
And his story repe@@ ats itself in urban centers around the world.
It is the story of the dis@@ enfr@@ anch@@ is@@ ed, un@@ employed urban youth who spar@@ ks ri@@ ots in Joh@@ ann@@ es@@ bur@@ g, spar@@ ks ri@@ ots in London, who reaches out for something other than wai@@ tho@@ od.
For young people, the promise of the city, the big city dream is that of opportunity, of jobs, of wealth, but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities.
Of@@ ten it's youth who suffer from the highest unemploy@@ ment r@@ ates.
By 2030, three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18@@ .
If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities, if we do not provide them opportuni@@ ties, the story of wai@@ tho@@ od, the gate@@ way to terror@@ ism, to violence, to gang@@ s, will be the story of cities 2.@@ 0.
And in my city of bir@@ th, M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ hu@@ , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemploy@@ ment.
70 percent don't work, don't go to school.
They pretty much do nothing.
I went back to M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u last month, and I went to visit Mad@@ ina Hos@@ pit@@ al, the hospital I was born in.
I remember standing in front of that bul@@ le@@ t-@@ rid@@ den hospital thinking, what if I had never lef@@ t?
What if I had been forced into that same state of wai@@ tho@@ od@@ ?
Would I have become a terror@@ ist@@ ?
I'm not really sure about the answer.
My reason for being in M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneur@@ ship sum@@ m@@ it.
I brought together about 90 young Som@@ ali leaders.
We sat down and brainstor@@ med on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city.
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den.
He went to university in M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ hu@@ , gradu@@ ated.
There were no jobs, no opportunities.
I remember him telling me, because he was a college gradu@@ ate, unemploy@@ ed, frustr@@ ated, that he was the perfect target for al Sh@@ ab@@ aa@@ b and other terrorist organizations, to be recru@@ i@@ ted.
They s@@ ought people like him out.
But his story takes a different rou@@ te.
In M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ hu@@ , the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the road@@ s.
Twenty-@@ three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system, and a motor@@ bike can be the easiest way to get around.
A@@ den saw an opportunity and se@@ ized it.
He started a motor@@ bike company.
He began rent@@ ing out motor@@ bi@@ kes to local residents who couldn't normally afford them.
He bought 10 bi@@ kes, with the help of family and friends, and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years.
How is this story different@@ ?
What makes his story different@@ ?
I believe it is his ability to identify and se@@ ize a new opportunity.
It's entrepreneur@@ ship, and I believe entrepreneur@@ ship can be the most powerful tool against wai@@ tho@@ od.
It em@@ powers young people to be the cre@@ ators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately see@@ king.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneur@@ s.
I want to talk to you about a young man who atten@@ ded one of my meet@@ ings, Moham@@ ed Moham@@ ou@@ d, a flor@@ ist.
He was helping me train some of the young people at the sum@@ mit in entrepreneur@@ ship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneur@@ ship.
He's actually the first flor@@ ist M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Moham@@ ed came along, if you wanted flowers at your wed@@ ding, you used plastic b@@ ou@@ qu@@ ets shipped from ab@@ road.
If you asked someone, "When was the last time you saw fresh flow@@ er@@ s?"
For many who grew up under civil war, the answer would be, "N@@ ever@@ ."
So Moham@@ ed saw an opportunity.
He started a landscap@@ ing and design flor@@ al company.
He created a farm right outside of M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ hu@@ , and started growing tu@@ li@@ ps and l@@ ili@@ es, which he said could survive the har@@ sh M@@ og@@ ad@@ ish@@ u climate.
And he began delivering flowers to wed@@ d@@ ings, creating gar@@ d@@ ens at homes and businesses around the city, and he's now working on creating M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ hu@@ 's first public park in 22 years.
There's no public park in M@@ og@@ ad@@ is@@ hu@@ .
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can come together, and, as he says, smell the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ros@@ es.
And he doesn't grow ros@@ es because they use too much water, by the way.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, Moham@@ ed@@ 's presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room.
They had never really thought about starting up a business.
They've thought about working for an NG@@ O, working for the government, but his story, his innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneur@@ s, that they could be change mak@@ ers.
By the end of the day, they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city.
They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems.
So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneur@@ ship is a really great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality.
They need expertise and ment@@ or@@ ship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses.
Connec@@ t young people with the resources they need, provide them the support they need to go from ide@@ ation to creation, and you will create cat@@ al@@ yst@@ s for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneur@@ ship is more than just starting up a business.
It's about creating a social impact.
Moham@@ ed is not simply selling flow@@ ers.
I believe he is selling hope.
His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it, when it's created, will actually transform the way people see their city.
A@@ den hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bi@@ kes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralys@@ is of wai@@ tho@@ od.
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is, turn youth into entrepreneur@@ s, incub@@ ate and nur@@ ture their inherent innovation, and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Par@@ ks than of car bombs and wai@@ tho@@ od.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: New York City residents produce 1@@ 1,000 tons of garbage every day. Every day@@ ! This astonishing stati@@ stic is just one of the reasons Robin N@@ ag@@ le started a research project with the cit@@ y's Department of S@@ an@@ it@@ ation. She walked the rout@@ es, operated mechanical bro@@ om@@ s, even drove a garbage truck her@@ self-@@ all so she could answer a simple@@ -@@ s@@ ounding but complicated question: who cle@@ ans up after us?
Robin N@@ ag@@ le: What I discovered in New York City tr@@ ash.
I was about 10 years old on a cam@@ ping trip with my dad in the A@@ dir@@ on@@ d@@ ack Moun@@ tain@@ s, a wil@@ der@@ ness area in the northern part of New York Sta@@ te.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest was spar@@ k@@ ling.
The sun made the leaves g@@ low like st@@ ained glass, and if it weren't for the path we were follow@@ ing, we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land.
We got to our camp@@ site.
It was a le@@ an-@@ to on a blu@@ ff looking over a cryst@@ al, beautiful la@@ ke, when I discovered a horr@@ or.
Be@@ hind the le@@ an-@@ to was a dum@@ p, maybe 40 feet square with rot@@ ting apple cores and bal@@ led@@ -up aluminum fo@@ il, and a dead sne@@ ak@@ er.
And I was aston@@ ished, I was very angr@@ y, and I was deeply confu@@ sed.
The cam@@ pers who were too laz@@ y to take out what they had brought in, who did they think would clean up after them?
That question stayed with me, and it simpli@@ fied a little.
Who cle@@ ans up after us?
Ho@@ we@@ ver you con@@ figure or wherever you place the us, who cle@@ ans up after us in Ist@@ an@@ bul@@ ?
Who cle@@ ans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London@@ ?
Here in New York, the Department of S@@ an@@ itation cle@@ ans up after us, to the tune of 1@@ 1,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recycl@@ ables every day.
I wanted to get to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who takes the job.
What's it like to wear the uni@@ form and bear that bur@@ den@@ ?
So I started a research project with them.
I ro@@ de in the trucks and walked the rou@@ tes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city, and I learned a lot, but I was still an out@@ sid@@ er.
I needed to go dee@@ per.
So I took the job as a sanit@@ ation work@@ er.
I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the truc@@ ks.
And I operated the mechanical bro@@ om@@ s and I plo@@ wed the s@@ now.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education.
Everyone asks about the sm@@ ell.
It's there, but it's not as preval@@ ent as you think, and on days when it is really bad, you get used to it rather quickly.
The weight takes a long time to get used to.
I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjus@@ ting to the burden of be@@ aring on your body tons of trash every week.
Then there's the danger.
According to the B@@ ure@@ au of Lab@@ or St@@ atis@@ tics, sanit@@ ation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occup@@ ations in the country, and I learned why.
You're in and out of traffic all day, and it's zo@@ om@@ ing around you.
It just wants to get past you, so it's often the motor@@ ist is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the work@@ er.
And then the garbage itself is full of haz@@ ards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible har@@ m.
I also learned about the rel@@ ent@@ less@@ ness of tr@@ ash.
When you step off the cur@@ b and you see a city from behind a truc@@ k, you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature un@@ to itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a form of respir@@ ation or circul@@ ation.
It must always be in motion.
And then there's the stig@@ ma.
You put on the uni@@ form, and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you've bloc@@ ked traffic with your truc@@ k, or you're taking a break too close to their home, or you're drinking coffee in their din@@ er, and they will come and s@@ corn you, and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.
I find the stig@@ ma especially iron@@ ic, because I strongly believe that sanit@@ ation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first guar@@ di@@ ans of public health.
If they're not taking away trash effici@@ ently and effectively every day, it starts to spill out of its contain@@ ments, and the dang@@ ers inherent to it thre@@ aten us in very real ways.
Dis@@ eas@@ es we've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't throw out the old stuff, we have no room for the new stuff, so then the engines of the economy start to sp@@ utter when consumption is compromis@@ ed.
I'm not advoc@@ ating capitalis@@ m, I'm just pointing out their relationship.
And then there's what I call our average, necessary quo@@ tidi@@ an veloc@@ ity.
By that I simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age.
We usually don't care for, re@@ pa@@ ir, cle@@ an, carry around our coffee c@@ up, our shopping bag@@ , our bottle of water.
We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them, because we know there's a workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away.
So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanit@@ ation that will perhaps help am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate the stig@@ ma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and human@@ e.
Their work, I think, is kind of lit@@ urg@@ ical.
They're on the streets every day, rhyth@@ mic@@ ally.
They wear a uni@@ form in many cities.
You know when to expect them.
And their work lets us do our work.
They are almost a form of re@@ assur@@ ance.
The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own dr@@ os@@ s, our cas@@ t-@@ off@@ s, and that flow must be maintain@@ ed always no matter wh@@ at.
On the day after September 11 in 2001, I heard the grow@@ l of a sanit@@ ation truck on the street, and I grabbed my infant son and I ran down@@ stairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every W@@ ed@@ nes@@ day.
And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days, but I started to cr@@ y.
And he looked at me, and he just no@@ d@@ ded, and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be ok@@ ay@@ ."
It was a little while later that I started my research with sanit@@ ation, and I met that man again.
His name is P@@ au@@ lie, and we worked together many times, and we became good friends.
I want to believe that P@@ au@@ lie was right.
We are going to be okay.
But in our effort to recon@@ figure how we as a species exist on this planet, we must include and take account of all the costs, including the very real human cost of the labor.
And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about, how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from cur@@ b@@ side recycl@@ ing, which is a remarkable success across 40 years, across the United States and countries around the world, and lift us up to a broader horiz@@ on where we're looking at other forms of waste.
That could be less@@ ened from manufacturing and industrial sources.
Mun@@ ici@@ p@@ al waste, what we think of when we talk about gar@@ b@@ age, accounts for three percent of the nation@@ 's waste stream.
It's a remarkable statis@@ tic.
So in the flow of your days, in the flow of your lives, next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you, take a moment to acknowledge them.
Take a moment to say thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When TED Fellow X@@ avi@@ er V@@ il@@ alta was commission@@ ed to create a multi@@ story shopping mall in Ad@@ d@@ is A@@ bab@@ a, he pan@@ ick@@ ed. Other centers represented everything he hated about contemporary architec@@ ture@@ : waste@@ ful, glass tow@@ ers requ@@ iring tons of energy whose design had absolutely nothing to do with Africa. In this charming talk, V@@ il@@ alta shows how he cham@@ p@@ ions an alternative approach@@ : to harness nature, reference design tradition and create beautiful, moder@@ n, iconic buildings fit for a community.
X@@ avi@@ er V@@ il@@ al@@ ta: Architec@@ ture at home in its community.
My work foc@@ uses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and tradi@@ tions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are in emerging countries, one in Ethiop@@ ia and another one in Tunis@@ ia.
And also they have in common that the different analys@@ es from different perspec@@ tives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an inv@@ itation to design a multi@@ story shopping mall in Ethiop@@ i@@ a's capital city Ad@@ d@@ is A@@ bab@@ a.
And this is the type of building we were shown as an example, to my team and myself, of what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, I want to run away.
After seeing a few of these buildings - there are many in the city - we realized that they have three very big points.
First, these buildings, they are almost empty because they have very large sho@@ ps where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside, and then you need a lot of cool@@ ing.
In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that rang@@ es from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.
And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiop@@ ia.
It is a p@@ ity in a place that has such rich culture and tradi@@ tions.
Also during our first visit to Ethiop@@ ia, I was really cap@@ tiv@@ ated by the old mer@@ k@@ ato that is this open-@@ air structure where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day from small vend@@ ors.
And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the out@@ doors to create activity.
So I thought, this is what I really want to design, not a shopping m@@ all.
But the question was how we could do a multi@@ story, contemporary building with these princi@@ ples.
The next challenge was when we looked at the site, that is, in a really growing area of the city, where most of these buildings that you see in the image, they were not there.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entr@@ ances of the building.
And this ex@@ tends with an inclin@@ ed a@@ tri@@ um that creates an open-@@ air space in the building that self-@@ protec@@ ts itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain@@ .
And around this vo@@ id we placed this idea of the market with small sho@@ ps, that change in each floor because of the shape of the vo@@ id.
I also thought, how to close the build@@ ing?
And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about the tex@@ tile like a shell made of concrete with perfor@@ ations that would let the air in, and also the light, but in a fil@@ tered way.
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful patterns of the Ethiop@@ ian women's dr@@ ess@@ es.
That they have frac@@ tal geome@@ try properties and this helped me to shape the whole fac@@ ade.
And we are building that with these small pre@@ fabric@@ ated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building.
And this is comple@@ mented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developer@@ s because they were like, "This is not a shopping m@@ all. We didn't ask for that."
But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more prof@@ itable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more sho@@ ps to s@@ ell.
And also that the idea of the fac@@ ade was much, much cheaper@@ , not only because of the material compared with the glass, but also because we didn't need to have air condition@@ ing anymore.
So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project.
And the first implement@@ ation was to think about how we could make the building self-@@ sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.
So we created a huge as@@ set by plac@@ ing photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics there on the ro@@ of.
And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban o@@ as@@ is.
And these por@@ ches on the roof, all together they collect the water to re@@ use for sanit@@ ation on the inside.
Hope@@ fully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construc@@ tion.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apart@@ ments and facilities in the city of Tun@@ is.
And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever desig@@ ned, I really needed to understand the city of Tun@@ is, but also its surround@@ ings and the tradition and culture.
During that analysis I paid special attention to the med@@ ina that is this 1,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall, opened by tw@@ el@@ ve different g@@ ates, connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the site, the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Bar@@ cel@@ ona and other cities in Europe with these cour@@ ty@@ ar@@ ds.
On top of that, we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the g@@ ates and connecting them by straight lines, and this modi@@ fied this initial pattern.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apart@@ ment, as an essential part of the master plan.
And for that I thought, what would be the best orient@@ ation in the Mediterr@@ ane@@ an climate for an apart@@ ment@@ ?
And it's nor@@ th-@@ sou@@ th, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventil@@ ation.
So we over@@ lap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apart@@ ments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with cour@@ ty@@ ar@@ ds, and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestri@@ ans.
And also it respon@@ ds to the local regul@@ ations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.
And it also rein@@ forces this idea of the g@@ ates.
The volume has this connecting shape that sh@@ ades itself with three different types of apart@@ ments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the cour@@ ty@@ ards there are the different facil@@ ities, such as a gy@@ m and a kindergar@@ ten and close by, a series of commercial [@@ spaces@@ ] that bring activity to the ground floor.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construc@@ tion.
And it's where all the neighbor@@ s, they can go up and soci@@ aliz@@ e, and do activities such as having a two-@@ kilome@@ ter run in the morning, jumping from one building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What is je@@ al@@ ou@@ sy@@ ? What drives it, and why do we secre@@ tly love it? No study has ever been able to capture its "@@ lon@@ el@@ in@@ ess, longev@@ ity, gri@@ m thr@@ ill@@ " - that is, says Par@@ u@@ l Se@@ h@@ g@@ al, except for fic@@ tion. In an elo@@ qu@@ ent medit@@ ation she s@@ cour@@ s pages from literature to show how je@@ al@@ ous@@ y is not so different from a quest for knowledge.
Par@@ u@@ l Se@@ h@@ gal@@ : An ode to en@@ v@@ y.
So when I was eight years old, a new girl came to join the class, and she was so impress@@ ive, as the new girl always seems to be.
She had vast quanti@@ ties of very shin@@ y hair and a cute little pencil case, super strong on state capit@@ als, just a great sp@@ ell@@ er.
And I just cur@@ d@@ led with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y that year, until I hat@@ ched my de@@ vi@@ ous plan.
So one day I stayed a little late after school, a little too late, and I l@@ ur@@ ked in the girl@@ s' bathro@@ om.
When the coast was clear, I emerg@@ ed, cre@@ pt into the classroom, and took from my teacher@@ 's desk the grade book.
And then I did it.
I fid@@ d@@ led with my ri@@ val@@ 's grad@@ es, just a little, just demo@@ ted some of those A@@ 's.
All of those A@@ 's. And I got ready to return the book to the draw@@ er, when hang on, some of my other class@@ mates had app@@ all@@ ingly good grades too.
So, in a fr@@ enz@@ y, I correc@@ ted everybody's mark@@ s, not imagin@@ ati@@ vely.
I gave everybody a row of D@@ 's and I gave myself a row of A@@ 's, just because I was there, you know, might as well.
And I am still b@@ af@@ f@@ led by my behavior.
I don't understand where the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt so great doing it.
I felt great.
I don't understand why I was never cau@@ gh@@ t.
I mean, it should have been so bl@@ at@@ antly obvious.
I was never cau@@ gh@@ t.
But most of all, I am b@@ af@@ f@@ led by, why did it bother me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl, was so good at sp@@ ell@@ ing?
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y b@@ af@@ f@@ les me.
It's so myster@@ i@@ ous, and it's so pervas@@ ive.
We know babies suffer from je@@ al@@ ous@@ y.
We know pri@@ mates do. Blu@@ e@@ birds are actually very pr@@ one.
We know that je@@ al@@ ous@@ y is the number one cause of s@@ pous@@ al murder in the United States.
And yet, I have never read a study that can par@@ se to me its lon@@ el@@ iness or its longev@@ ity or its gri@@ m thr@@ ill.
For that, we have to go to fic@@ tion, because the novel is the lab that has studied je@@ al@@ ous@@ y in every possible configur@@ ation.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exagger@@ ation to say that if we didn't have je@@ al@@ ous@@ y, would we even have liter@@ ature@@ ?
Well no faith@@ less Hel@@ en, no "O@@ dys@@ se@@ y."
No je@@ al@@ ous king, no "@@ Arab@@ ian N@@ ight@@ s."
No Shakespe@@ are.
There goes high school reading list@@ s, because we're losing "S@@ ound and the Fur@@ y," we're losing "G@@ at@@ s@@ by@@ ," "@@ Sun Also Ris@@ es," we're losing "M@@ ad@@ ame B@@ ov@@ ar@@ y," "@@ Anna K@@ ."
No je@@ al@@ ous@@ y, no Pr@@ ou@@ st. And now, I mean, I know it's fashion@@ able to say that Pr@@ ou@@ st has the answers to everything, but in the case of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y, he kind of does.
This year is the cent@@ enni@@ al of his master@@ piece, "In S@@ ear@@ ch of L@@ ost Ti@@ me@@ ," and it's the most exhaus@@ tive study of sexual je@@ al@@ ous@@ y and just regular competi@@ tiv@@ eness, my br@@ and, that we can hope to have. And we think about Pr@@ ou@@ st, we think about the senti@@ mental bits, right?
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.
We think about a mad@@ ele@@ ine mo@@ ist@@ ened in lav@@ ender tea.
We forget how har@@ sh his vision was.
We forget how pi@@ ti@@ less he is.
I mean, these are books that Virgin@@ ia Wo@@ ol@@ f said were tough as cat gu@@ t.
I don't know what cat gut is, but let's assume it's formid@@ able.
Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and je@@ al@@ ous@@ y, je@@ al@@ ous@@ y and Pr@@ ou@@ st.
Is it something as obvious as that je@@ al@@ ous@@ y, which bo@@ ils down into person, desire@@ , impedi@@ ment, is such a solid narrative found@@ ation?
I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone, because let's think about what happens when we feel je@@ al@@ ous.
When we feel je@@ al@@ ous, we tell ourselves a story.
We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terri@@ ble.
As the tel@@ ler of the tale and the audience, we know just what details to inclu@@ de, to dig that knife in. Right?
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y makes us all amate@@ ur novel@@ ists, and this is something Pr@@ ou@@ st understo@@ od.
In the first volume, S@@ wan@@ n@@ 's W@@ ay, the series of books, S@@ wan@@ n, one of the main character@@ s, is thinking very fon@@ dly of his mis@@ tr@@ ess and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sent@@ ences, and these are Pr@@ ou@@ sti@@ an sent@@ ences, so they're long as ri@@ vers, but in the course of a few sent@@ ences, he suddenly re@@ co@@ ils and he realiz@@ es, "H@@ ang on, everything I love about this woman.
Somebody else would love about this woman.
Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleas@@ ure, maybe right about now."
And this is the story he starts to tell himself, and from then on, Pr@@ ou@@ st writes that every fresh char@@ m S@@ wan@@ n detec@@ ts in his mis@@ tr@@ ess, he adds to his "@@ collection of instruments in his private tor@@ ture cham@@ ber@@ ."
Now S@@ wan@@ n and Pr@@ ou@@ st, we have to adm@@ it, were no@@ tori@@ ously je@@ al@@ ous.
You know, Pr@@ ou@@ st@@ 's boy@@ friends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him.
But you don't have to be that je@@ al@@ ous to conce@@ de that it's hard work. Right?
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y is exha@@ ust@@ ing.
It's a hungry emotion. It must be f@@ ed.
And what does je@@ al@@ ous@@ y like?
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y likes information.
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y likes deta@@ ils.
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y likes the vast quanti@@ ties of shin@@ y hair, the cute little pencil case.
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y likes pho@@ tos.
That's why In@@ stag@@ ram is such a h@@ it. Pr@@ ou@@ st actually links the language of scholar@@ ship and je@@ al@@ ous@@ y.
When S@@ wan@@ n is in his je@@ al@@ ous thro@@ es, and suddenly he's listening at door@@ ways and bri@@ bing his mis@@ tr@@ ess@@ ' serv@@ ants, he def@@ ends these behavi@@ ors.
He says, "You know, look, I know you think this is rep@@ ug@@ n@@ ant, but it is no different from interpre@@ ting an ancient text or looking at a monument@@ ."
He says, "@@ They are scientific investig@@ ations with real intellectual valu@@ e."
Pr@@ ou@@ st is trying to show us that je@@ al@@ ous@@ y feels intoler@@ able and makes us look absur@@ d, but it is, at its cru@@ x, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth, painful truth, and actually, where Pr@@ ou@@ st is concer@@ ned, the more painful the truth, the better.
Gri@@ ef@@ , humili@@ ation, los@@ s: These were the aven@@ u@@ es to wisdom for Pr@@ ou@@ st.
He says, "A woman whom we need, who makes us suffer@@ , el@@ ic@@ its from us a gam@@ ut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us."
Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women@@ ?
No. I think he's trying to say that je@@ al@@ ous@@ y reveals us to ourselves.
And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way?
Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggress@@ ion and our h@@ ide@@ ous ambi@@ tion and our entit@@ le@@ ment@@ ?
Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar inten@@ sit@@ y?
Fre@@ u@@ d would write about this later.
One day, Fre@@ u@@ d was visited by this very anxi@@ ous young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife che@@ ating on him.
And Fre@@ u@@ d says, it's something strange about this guy, because he's not looking at what his wife is doing.
Because she's bl@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ; everybody knows it.
The poor creature is just under suspic@@ ion for no cause.
But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without notic@@ ing, un@@ inten@@ tional behavi@@ ors.
Is she smil@@ ing too brigh@@ tly here, or did she accident@@ ally brush up against a man there?
[@@ Fre@@ ud@@ ] says that the man is becoming the custo@@ di@@ an of his wife@@ 's un@@ consci@@ ous.
The novel is very good on this point.
The novel is very good at describing how je@@ al@@ ous@@ y trains us to look with intensity but not accur@@ acy.
In fact, the more inten@@ sely je@@ al@@ ous we are, the more we become residents of fantas@@ y.
And this is why, I think, je@@ al@@ ous@@ y doesn't just provo@@ ke us to do violent things or illegal things.
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y pro@@ mp@@ ts us to behave in ways that are wil@@ dly inv@@ enti@@ ve.
Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I conce@@ de, but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news.
A 5@@ 2@@ -year-old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vi@@ le, h@@ ide@@ ous messages to herself for a year.
For a year. A year.
And she was trying to frame her ex-@@ boy@@ friend's new girl@@ friend, and I have to conf@@ ess when I heard this, I just reac@@ ted with admir@@ ation.
Because, I mean, let's be real.
What immen@@ se, if mis@@ plac@@ ed, creativity. Right?
This is something from a no@@ vel.
This is something from a Patr@@ icia High@@ sm@@ ith no@@ vel.
Now High@@ sm@@ ith is a particular favorite of mine.
She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American let@@ ters.
She's the author of "S@@ tr@@ ang@@ ers on a Tr@@ ain@@ " and "The Tal@@ ented Mr. Ri@@ ple@@ y," books that are all about how je@@ al@@ ous@@ y, it mud@@ d@@ les our minds, and once we're in the sp@@ here, in that realm of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y, the membran@@ e between what is and what could be can be pi@@ er@@ c@@ ed in an inst@@ ant.
Take Tom Ri@@ ple@@ y, her most famous character.
Now, Tom Ri@@ ple@@ y goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had, and you're under the flo@@ or@@ boar@@ ds, he's answering to your name, he's wearing your r@@ ings, empt@@ ying your bank accoun@@ t.
That's one way to go.
But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ri@@ ple@@ y rou@@ te.
I can't give the world D@@ 's, as much as I would really like to, some days.
And it's a p@@ ity, because we live in envi@@ ous times.
We live in je@@ al@@ ous times.
I mean, we're all good citizens of social media, aren't we, where the currency is en@@ v@@ y?
Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure.
So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in possess@@ ion of a myster@@ y.
Let's go to 2@@ 21@@ B Bak@@ er Street and ask for Sher@@ lock Hol@@ mes.
When people think of Hol@@ mes, they think of his n@@ em@@ esis being Professor M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty, right, this criminal mas@@ termin@@ d.
But I've always prefer@@ red [@@ In@@ spec@@ tor@@ ] L@@ estr@@ ade, who is the rat@@ -@@ faced head of Scot@@ land Y@@ ard who needs Hol@@ mes desper@@ ately, needs Hol@@ mes@@ ' geni@@ us, but res@@ ents him.
Oh, it's so familiar to me.
So L@@ estr@@ ade needs his help, res@@ ents him, and sort of see@@ th@@ es with bit@@ tern@@ ess over the course of the myster@@ ies.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Ad@@ venture of the Six N@@ apo@@ le@@ on@@ s," once Hol@@ mes comes in, d@@ azz@@ les everybody with his solution, L@@ estr@@ ade turns to Hol@@ mes and he says, "We're not je@@ al@@ ous of you, Mr. Hol@@ mes.
We're proud of you."
And he says that there's not a man at Scot@@ land Y@@ ard who wouldn't want to shake Sher@@ lock Hol@@ mes@@ ' hand.
It's one of the few times we see Hol@@ mes moved in the myster@@ ies, and I find it very moving, this little scen@@ e, but it's also myster@@ i@@ ous, right?
It seems to treat je@@ al@@ ous@@ y as a problem of geometr@@ y, not emotion.
You know, one minute Hol@@ mes is on the other side from L@@ estr@@ ade.
The next minute they're on the same side.
Sudden@@ ly, L@@ estr@@ ade is letting himself admir@@ e this mind that he's res@@ ented.
Could it be so simple though@@ ?
What if je@@ al@@ ous@@ y really is a matter of geometr@@ y, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to an@@ other@@ ?
Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to res@@ ent somebody's excell@@ ence.
We could al@@ ign ourselves with it.
But I like conting@@ ency plan@@ s.
So while we wait for that to happen, let us remember that we have fiction for con@@ sol@@ ation.
Fic@@ tion alone dem@@ y@@ sti@@ fies je@@ al@@ ous@@ y.
Fic@@ tion alone domes@@ tica@@ tes it, invi@@ tes it to the table.
And look who it gather@@ s: sweet L@@ estr@@ ade, terrifying Tom Ri@@ ple@@ y, crazy S@@ wan@@ n, Mar@@ cel Pr@@ ou@@ st himself.
We are in excellent company.

TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In 196@@ 9, B@@ uz@@ z Al@@ drin@@ ’s historical step onto the moon leap@@ t man@@ kind into an era of technological possibil@@ ity. The awesome power of technology was to be used to solve all of our big problems. F@@ ast forward to present day, and what's happened? Are mobile apps all we have to show for ourselv@@ es? Journ@@ alist Jason Pon@@ tin looks closely at the challenges we face to using technology effectively ... for problems that really matter.
Jason Pon@@ tin@@ : Can technology solve our big problem@@ s?
So, we used to solve big problems.
On July 21@@ st, 196@@ 9, B@@ uz@@ z Al@@ dr@@ in climbed out of Apollo 11@@ 's lun@@ ar modul@@ e and des@@ cen@@ ded onto the Sea of Tr@@ an@@ quil@@ ity.
Armstrong and Al@@ dr@@ in were alone, but their presence on the mo@@ on's gray surface was the cul@@ min@@ ation of a convul@@ si@@ ve, collective effort.
The Apollo program was the greatest peace@@ time mobil@@ ization in the history of the United States.
To get to the moon, NASA spent around 180 billion dollars in today's money, or four percent of the federal bud@@ get.
Apollo employed around 4@@ 00,000 people and de@@ man@@ ded the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government ag@@ encies.
People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program ende@@ d, 24 men flew to the moon.
Tw@@ el@@ ve walked on its surface, of whom Al@@ dr@@ in, following the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most sen@@ i@@ or.
So why did they go?
They didn't bring much back@@ : 8@@ 41 pounds of old roc@@ ks, and something all 24 later emphas@@ ized - a new sense of the small@@ ness and the fragil@@ ity of our common home.
Why did they go? The cy@@ n@@ ical answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show the Sovi@@ ets that his nation had the better rocket@@ s.
But Kenne@@ d@@ y's own words at R@@ ice University in 196@@ 2 provide a better clu@@ e.
John F. Kenne@@ d@@ y: But why, some say, the mo@@ on?
Why choose this as our go@@ al?
And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain@@ ?
Wh@@ y, 35 years ago, fly the Atlan@@ tic@@ ?
Why does R@@ ice play Tex@@ as?
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
Jason Pon@@ tin@@ : To contempor@@ aries, Apollo wasn't only a vic@@ tory of West over East in the Cold War.
At the time, the strong@@ est emotion was of wonder at the transcend@@ ent powers of technology.
They went because it was a big thing to do.
L@@ anding on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological trium@@ ph@@ s.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplan@@ e, penic@@ ill@@ in and a vaccine for tuberculos@@ is.
In the middle years of the century, polio was eradic@@ ated and smallpox elimin@@ ated.
Technology itself seemed to poss@@ ess what Al@@ vin T@@ of@@ fl@@ er in 19@@ 70 called "@@ acceler@@ ative thr@@ ust@@ ."
For most of human history, we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sa@@ il, but in 196@@ 9, the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 25,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human beings have been back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and bli@@ the optimism about technolog@@ y's powers has evapor@@ ated as big problems we had imagined technology would sol@@ ve, such as going to Mars, creating clean energy, cur@@ ing cancer, or feeding the world have come to seem intr@@ ac@@ t@@ ably hard.
I remember watching the lif@@ to@@ ff of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me not to stare at the fi@@ ery exha@@ ust of a Saturn V rock@@ et.
I v@@ agu@@ ely knew this was to be the last of the moon mission@@ s, but I was absolutely certain there would be Mars colonies in my lifetime.
So "@@ Something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technolog@@ y" has become a common@@ place.
You hear it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.
It feels as if technolog@@ ists have diver@@ ted us and en@@ ric@@ hed themselves with trivial to@@ ys, with things like iPh@@ ones and apps and social media, or algorithms that speed automa@@ ted trad@@ ing.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and en@@ ric@@ hed our lives.
But they don't solve humanit@@ y's big problems.
What happened?
So there is a par@@ oc@@ hi@@ al explanation in Silicon Valley, which adm@@ its that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it fin@@ anced Intel@@ , Microsoft, Apple and Gen@@ ente@@ ch.
Silicon Valley says the markets are to bl@@ ame, in particular the incentives that venture capit@@ alists offer to entrepreneur@@ s.
Silicon Valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transforma@@ tional ideas and towards funding incre@@ mental problems or even fake problems.
But I don't think that explanation is good enough.
It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley.
Even when venture capit@@ alists were at their most ris@@ k-@@ happy, they prefer@@ red small invest@@ ments, tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years.
V@@ .@@ C.@@ s have always strugg@@ led to invest prof@@ it@@ ably in technologies such as energy whose capital require@@ ments are huge and whose development is long and leng@@ th@@ y, and V@@ .@@ C.@@ s have never, never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that poss@@ ess no immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and more prof@@ ound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
We could go to Mars if we want.
NASA even has the out@@ line of a plan.
But going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appe@@ al, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars, because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because our political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption deriv@@ es from advanc@@ ed, renewable sources such as solar, wind and bio@@ fuel@@ s, less than two percent, and the reason is purely econom@@ ic.
Co@@ al and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and petrole@@ um is cheaper than bio@@ fuels.
We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price. None exist.
Now, technolog@@ ists, business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international tre@@ ati@@ es would sp@@ ur the development of alternative energ@@ y: mos@@ tly, a significant increase in energy research and development, and some kind of price on carb@@ on.
But there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy or international tre@@ ati@@ es that reflect that cons@@ ens@@ us.
Sometimes, big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so.
Fam@@ ines were long understood to be caused by failures in food suppl@@ y.
But 30 years of research have taught us that fam@@ ines are political crises that catastroph@@ ically affect food distribu@@ tion.
Technology can improve things like crop yiel@@ ds or systems for stor@@ ing and transport@@ ing food, but there will be fam@@ ines so long as there are bad govern@@ ments.
Finally, big problems sometimes el@@ u@@ de solution because we don't really understand the problem.
President N@@ ix@@ on declar@@ ed war on cancer in 197@@ 1, but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer, most of them fi@@ en@@ dish@@ ly resistant to therap@@ y, and it is only in the last 10 years that effective, vi@@ able therap@@ ies have come to seem real.
H@@ ard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.
We can, we mus@@ t, but these four elements must all be present@@ : Pol@@ i@@ tical leaders and the public must care to solve a problem@@ ; institutions must support its solu@@ tion; It must really be a technological problem@@ ; and we must understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become a kind of metaphor for technolog@@ y's capacity to solve big problems, met these cr@@ iter@@ ia.
But it is an irre@@ produ@@ ci@@ ble model for the future.
It is not 196@@ 1.
There is no gal@@ van@@ izing cont@@ est like the Cold War, no politici@@ an like John Kennedy who can hero@@ ize the difficult and the dangerous, and no popular science fic@@ tional myth@@ ology such as exploring the solar system.
Most of all, going to the moon turned out to be easy.
It was just three days away.
And argu@@ ably it wasn't even solving much of a problem.
We are left alone with our day, and the solutions of the future will be harder w@@ on.
God knows, we don't lack for the challenges.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Tr@@ ust is on the declin@@ e, and we need to rebuild it. That@@ ’s a commonly heard suggestion for making a better world … but, says philosopher On@@ ora O@@ ’@@ Ne@@ ill, we don’t really understand what we're suggest@@ ing. She fli@@ ps the question, showing us that our three most common ideas about trust are actually mis@@ direc@@ ted.
On@@ ora O'@@ Ne@@ ill@@ : What we don't understand about trust.
So I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by remin@@ ding you of the standard views that people have about trust.
I think these are so common@@ place, they've become clich@@ és of our society.
And I think there are three.
One@@ 's a claim@@ : there has been a great decline in trust, very widely belie@@ ved.
The second is an aim@@ : we should have more trust.
And the third is a tas@@ k: we should rebuild trust.
I think that the cla@@ im, the aim and the task are all mis@@ conce@@ i@@ ved.
So what I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a cla@@ im, an aim and a task which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter.
First the claim@@ : Why do people think trust has declin@@ ed?
And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I'm inclin@@ ed to think it may have declin@@ ed in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others.
I don't have an over@@ view.
But, of course, I can look at the opinion pol@@ ls, and the opinion pol@@ ls are suppos@@ edly the source of a belief that trust has declin@@ ed.
When you actually look at opinion pol@@ ls across time, there's not much evidence for that.
That's to say, the people who were mis@@ trusted 20 years ago, princip@@ ally journalists and politici@@ ans, are still mis@@ trus@@ ted.
And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trus@@ te@@ d: judg@@ es, nur@@ ses.
The rest of us are in between, and by the way, the average person in the street is almost exactly mid@@ way.
But is that good evid@@ ence?
What opinion pol@@ ls record is, of course, opin@@ ions.
What else can they recor@@ d?
So they're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions.
Do you trust politici@@ ans? Do you trust teacher@@ s?
Now if somebody said to you, "Do you trust green@@ groc@@ ers?
Do you trust fish@@ mon@@ ger@@ s?
Do you trust elementary school teacher@@ s?"
You would probably begin by saying, "To do what@@ ?"
And that would be a perfectly sensi@@ ble response.
And you might say, when you understood the answer to that, "Well, I trust some of them, but not other@@ s."
That's a perfectly rational thing.
In short, in our real lives, we seek to place trust in a differenti@@ ated way.
We don't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every inst@@ ance of a certain type of official or offic@@ e-@@ hol@@ der or type of person is going to be uni@@ form.
I m@@ ight, for example, say that I certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to teach the rece@@ ption class to read, but in no way to drive the school mini@@ bus@@ .
I m@@ ight, after all, know that she wasn't a good dri@@ ver.
I might trust my most lo@@ qu@@ aci@@ ous friend to keep a conversation going but not - but perhaps not to keep a secret.
Sim@@ ple.
So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differenti@@ ated, why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstr@@ ac@@ t@@ ly?
I think the pol@@ ls are very bad gu@@ ides to the level of trust that actually exists, because they try to ob@@ liter@@ ate the good judgment that goes into plac@@ ing trust.
Secondly, what about the aim@@ ?
The aim is to have more trust.
Well frankly, I think that's a stupid a@@ im.
It's not what I would aim at.
I would aim to have more trust in the trust@@ worthy but not in the un@@ trust@@ worth@@ y.
In fact, I aim posi@@ tively to try not to trust the un@@ trust@@ worth@@ y.
And I think, of those people who, for example, placed their savings with the very ap@@ tly named Mr. Mad@@ off, who then made off with them, and I think of them, and I think, well, yes, too much trust.
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.
Intel@@ lig@@ ently placed and intellig@@ ently refused trust is the proper a@@ im.
Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess.
It's jud@@ ging how trust@@ worthy people are in particular respec@@ ts.
And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.
Are they compe@@ tent@@ ? Are they honest@@ ? Are they reli@@ able?
And if we find that a person is compet@@ ent in the relevant mat@@ ters, and reliable and honest, we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them, because they'll be trust@@ worth@@ y.
But if, on the other hand, they're un@@ reli@@ able, we might not.
I have friends who are compet@@ ent and honest, but I would not trust them to post a let@@ ter, because they're for@@ get@@ ful.
I have friends who are very confident they can do certain things, but I realize that they over@@ estimate their own compe@@ ten@@ ce.
And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends who are compet@@ ent and reliable but extremely dis@@ hon@@ est.
If so, I haven't yet spot@@ ted it.
But that's what we're looking for@@ : trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess before trust.
Tr@@ ust is the response.
Tr@@ ust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess is what we have to jud@@ ge.
And, of course, it's difficult.
A@@ cross the last few decades, we've tried to construct systems of account@@ ability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess.
A lot of these systems have the conver@@ se effect.
They don't work as they're supposed to.
I remember I was talking with a mid@@ wife who said, "Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer to do the paper@@ work than to deliver the bab@@ y."
And all over our public life, our institutional life, we find that problem, that the system of account@@ ability that is meant to secure trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess and evidence of trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess is actually doing the opposite.
It is distrac@@ ting people who have to do difficult tas@@ ks, like mid@@ wi@@ ves, from doing them by requ@@ iring them to tic@@ k the box@@ es, as we say.
You can all give your own examples there.
So so much for the a@@ im.
The a@@ im, I think, is more trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess, and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trust@@ worthy and communicate our trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess to other people, and if we are trying to judge whether other people or offic@@ e-@@ holders or politicians are trust@@ worth@@ y.
It's not easy. It is judg@@ ment, and simple reac@@ tion, attitu@@ des, don't do adequ@@ ately here.
Now thir@@ dly, the task.
C@@ alling the task re@@ building trust, I think, also gets things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do that for ourselves.
We can rebuild a bit of trust@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess.
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.
But trust, in the end, is distinc@@ tive because it's given by other people.
You can't rebuild what other people give you.
You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust.
So you have to, I think, be trust@@ worth@@ y.
And that, of course, is because you can't fo@@ ol all of the people all of the time, usu@@ ally.
But you also have to provide us@@ able evidence that you are trust@@ worth@@ y.
How to do it?
Well every day, all over the place, it's being done by ordinary people, by offici@@ als, by institutions, quite effec@@ tively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where I buy my soc@@ ks says I may take them back, and they don't ask any questions.
They take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of soc@@ ks of the color I wanted.
That's super@@ . I trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party, then that is very good evidence that you are trust@@ worthy and you have confidence in what you are saying.
So in the end, I think what we are aim@@ ing for is not very difficult to dis@@ cer@@ n.
It is relationships in which people are trust@@ worthy and can judge when and how the other person is trust@@ worth@@ y.
So the moral of all this is, we need to think much less about trust, let alone about attitudes of trust detec@@ ted or mis@@ -@@ detec@@ ted by opinion pol@@ ls, much more about being trust@@ worth@@ y, and how you give people adequ@@ ate, useful and simple evidence that you're trust@@ worth@@ y.
Thanks.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The border between our physical world and the digital information surrounding us has been getting thin@@ ner and thin@@ ner. Desig@@ ner and engineer J@@ inha Lee wants to dis@@ solve it al@@ together. As he demonstrates in this short, gas@@ p-@@ induc@@ ing talk, his ideas include a pen that pene@@ trates into a screen to draw 3D models and Spac@@ e@@ Top@@ , a computer desk@@ top prototype that lets you reach through the screen to manipulate digital objects.
J@@ inha Le@@ e: R@@ each into the computer and grab a pix@@ el.
Throughout the history of computers we've been str@@ iving to shor@@ ten the gap between us and digital information, the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild.
And this gap has become shor@@ ter, shor@@ ter, and even shor@@ ter, and now this gap is shor@@ ten@@ ed down to less than a milli@@ meter, the thick@@ ness of a touch@@ -@@ screen glass, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all?
I started to imagine what this would look like.
First, I created this tool which pene@@ trates into the digital space, so when you press it hard on the screen, it transfer@@ s its physical body into pix@@ els.
Design@@ ers can materi@@ alize their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, this boundary has been broken.
But our two hands still remain outside the screen.
How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity of our hand@@ s?
At Microsoft Ap@@ pli@@ ed Sci@@ ences, along with my mentor Cat@@ i B@@ oul@@ anger, I re@@ designed the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital work@@ space.
By combin@@ ing a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face, now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this 3D space and grab pix@@ els with your bare hands.
Because windows and fil@@ es have a position in the real space, selec@@ ting them is as easy as grab@@ bing a book off your shel@@ f.
Then you can flip through this book while high@@ lighting the lines, words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window.
Architec@@ ts can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands direc@@ tly.
So in these examples, we are reaching into the digital world.
But how about revers@@ ing its role and having the digital information reach us inste@@ ad@@ ?
I'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online.
But now you don't have to worry about it.
What I got here is an online aug@@ mented fit@@ ting room.
This is a view that you get from head-@@ mounted or se@@ e-@@ through display when the system understands the geome@@ try of your body.
T@@ aking this idea further, I started to think, instead of just seeing these pix@@ els in our space, how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it?
What would such a future look like?
At MIT Media Lab, along with my advis@@ or Hiros@@ hi I@@ shi@@ i and my collabor@@ ator Re@@ h@@ mi Pos@@ t, we created this one physical pix@@ el.
Well, in this case, this spher@@ ical magne@@ t acts like a 3D pix@@ el in our space, which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little 3D space.
What we did was essentially cancel@@ ing gravity and controlling the movement by combin@@ ing magnetic lev@@ itation and mechanical actu@@ ation and sensing technologies.
And by digit@@ ally programming the object, we are liber@@ ating the object from constraints of time and space, which means that now, human motions can be recorded and played back and left perman@@ ently in the physical world.
So choreo@@ graphy can be taught physically over distance and Michael Jord@@ an's famous shooting can be replic@@ ated over and over as a physical reality.
Stud@@ ents can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion, physics, and unlike computer scre@@ ens or text@@ books, this is a real, tangible experience that you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful.
And what's more exciting than just turning what's currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activi@@ ties.
As you can see, the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surround@@ ings without dis@@ connecting ourselves from our world.
Today, we started by talking about the boun@@ dar@@ y, but if we remove this boun@@ dar@@ y, the only boundary left is our imagination.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What happens when a dream you've held since childhood … doesn't come tru@@ e? As Lisa B@@ u adjus@@ ted to a new life in the United States, she turned to books to expand her mind and create a new path for her@@ self. She shares her unique approach to reading in this lo@@ vely, personal talk about the magic of books.
Lisa Bu@@ : How books can open your mind.
So I was trained to become a g@@ ym@@ n@@ ast for two years in Hun@@ an, China in the 197@@ 0s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for ath@@ let@@ es, all ex@@ pens@@ es pa@@ id.
But my ti@@ ger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them.
After surviv@@ ing the Cul@@ tural R@@ evolution, they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happin@@ ess@@ : a safe and well-@@ paid job.
It is not important if I like the job or not.
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera sing@@ er.
That is me playing my imagin@@ ary piano.
An opera sing@@ er must start training young to learn ac@@ rob@@ atic@@ s, so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show.
But no adults liked the idea.
No adults believed I was serious.
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids, just as power@@ less as I was.
So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be train@@ ed.
My dream would never come true.
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ class happiness would be the best I could hope for.
But that's so un@@ fa@@ ir.
So I was determined to find another call@@ ing.
Nobody around to teach me? Fin@@ e.
I turned to books.
I satis@@ fied my hunger for par@@ ental advice from this book by a family of writers and musici@@ ans@@ .@@ ["@@ Cor@@ respond@@ ence in the Fam@@ ily of F@@ ou Le@@ i@@ "] I found my role model of an independent woman when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an tradition requires obedi@@ ence@@ .@@ ["@@ Jane E@@ y@@ re@@ "] And I learned to be efficient from this book@@ .@@ [@@ "C@@ he@@ aper by the Do@@ z@@ en@@ "] And I was inspired to study ab@@ road after reading these.
["@@ Comple@@ te Wor@@ ks of S@@ an@@ ma@@ o" ] [@@ "L@@ ess@@ ons From Histor@@ y" by N@@ an Hu@@ ai@@ j@@ in@@ ] I came to the U.S. in 1995, so which books did I read here first@@ ?
Bo@@ oks ban@@ ned in China, of course.
"The Good Earth@@ " is about Chinese pe@@ as@@ ant life.
That's just not convenient for propaganda. Go@@ t it.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for a different day.
But the fifth command@@ ment gave me an epi@@ ph@@ any@@ : "You shall honor your father and mother@@ ."
"H@@ on@@ or@@ ," I said. "That's so different, and better, than obe@@ y."
So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an guil@@ t tra@@ p and to rest@@ art my relationship with my parents.
En@@ counter@@ ing a new culture also started my habit of compar@@ ative read@@ ing.
It offers many ins@@ igh@@ ts.
For example, I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with.
It had never occurred to me, China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.
A map actually carries somebody's view.
Com@@ par@@ ative reading actually is nothing new.
It's a standard practice in the academic world.
There are even research fields such as compar@@ ative religion and compar@@ ative literature.
Com@@ pare and contrast gives schol@@ ars a more complete understanding of a topic@@ .
So I thought, well, if compar@@ ative reading works for research, why not do it in daily life to@@ o?
So I started reading books in pair@@ s.
So they can be about people - ["@@ Benjamin Frank@@ lin@@ " by Walter Isa@@ ac@@ son@@ ]@@ ["@@ John Ad@@ am@@ s" by David Mc@@ Cul@@ l@@ ough@@ ] - who are involved in the same event, or friends with shared experiences.
["@@ Person@@ al Histor@@ y" by K@@ ath@@ ar@@ ine Gra@@ ham@@ ]@@ [@@ "The Snow@@ ball@@ : Warren Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t and the Business of Life@@ ," by Alice Sch@@ ro@@ ed@@ er@@ ] I also compare the same stories in different gen@@ res - [@@ Hol@@ y Bib@@ le: King James Ver@@ sion@@ ]@@ [@@ "L@@ amb@@ " by Chris@@ op@@ her Mo@@ ore@@ ] - or similar stories from different cultures, as Joseph Camp@@ b@@ ell did in his wonderful book@@ .@@ [@@ "The Po@@ wer of My@@ th@@ " by Joseph Camp@@ bell@@ ] For example, both the Chris@@ t and the Budd@@ ha went through three tempt@@ ations.
For the Chr@@ ist, the tempt@@ ations are econom@@ ic, political and spir@@ itu@@ al.
For the Budd@@ ha, they are all psycholog@@ ic@@ al: l@@ ust, fear and social duty - interesting.
So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
[@@ "The W@@ ay of Ch@@ u@@ ang T@@ zu@@ " Thomas Mer@@ ton@@ ]@@ [@@ "T@@ a@@ o: The Wat@@ er@@ course W@@ ay@@ " Alan W@@ att@@ s] Instead of lost in transl@@ ation, I found there is much to gain@@ .
For example, it's through translation that I realized "@@ happin@@ ess@@ " in Chinese literally means "@@ fast jo@@ y." Hu@@ h!
"@@ Br@@ ide@@ " in Chinese literally means "@@ new mother@@ ." U@@ h-@@ o@@ h.
Bo@@ oks have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present.
I know I shall never feel lonely or power@@ less again.
Having a dream shat@@ tered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffer@@ ed.
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a shat@@ tered dream can do that for you.
So because of books, I'm here today, happy, living again with a purpose and a clar@@ ity, most of the time.
So may books be always with you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Clin@@ ical psychologist Me@@ g Jay has a bold message for tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things: Contr@@ ary to popular belief@@ , your 20@@ s are not a thro@@ wa@@ way decade. In this provoc@@ ative talk, Jay says that just because marri@@ age, work and kids are happening later in life, does@@ n’t mean you can@@ ’t start planning now. She gives 3 pieces of advice for how tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things can re-@@ claim adul@@ th@@ ood in the defining decade of their lives.
Me@@ g J@@ ay@@ : Why 30 is not the new 20.
When I was in my 20@@ s, I saw my very first psycho@@ therapy cli@@ ent.
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkele@@ y.
She was a 26@@ -year-old woman named Ale@@ x.
Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big s@@ lou@@ ch@@ y top, and she dropped onto the cou@@ ch in my office and kicked off her fl@@ ats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems.
Now when I heard this, I was so reli@@ e@@ ved.
My class@@ mate got an ar@@ son@@ ist for her first cli@@ ent.
And I got a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something who wanted to talk about boys.
This I thought I could hand@@ le.
But I didn't handle it.
With the funny stories that Alex would bring to sess@@ ion, it was easy for me just to no@@ d my head while we kicked the can down the road.
"@@ Thir@@ ty@@ 's the new 20@@ ," Alex would say, and as far as I could tell, she was right.
Wor@@ k happened later, marriage happened later, kids happened later, even death happened later.
Tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things like Alex and I had nothing but time.
But before long, my super@@ vis@@ or pushed me to push Alex about her love life.
I pushed back.
I said, "S@@ ure, she's dating down, she's sleeping with a k@@ nuc@@ k@@ le@@ head, but it's not like she's going to marry the gu@@ y."
And then my super@@ vis@@ or said, "@@ Not yet, but she might marry the next one.
B@@ es@@ ides, the best time to work on Alex@@ 's marriage is before she has one."
That's what psychologists call an "A@@ ha@@ !" moment.
That was the moment I realized, 30 is not the new 20.
Yes, people set@@ tle down later than they used to, but that didn't make Alex@@ 's 20@@ s a developmental down@@ time.
That made Alex@@ 's 20@@ s a developmental sweet spot, and we were sitting there, blowing it.
That was when I realized that this sort of ben@@ ign neg@@ lect was a real problem, and it had real consequ@@ ences, not just for Alex and her love life but for the care@@ ers and the families and the fu@@ tures of tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things everywhere.
There are 50 million tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things in the United States right now.
We're talking about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that no one's getting through adul@@ th@@ ood without going through their 20@@ s first.
Ra@@ ise your hand if you're in your 20@@ s.
I really want to see some tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things here.
Oh, y@@ ay@@ ! You are all awesome.
If you work with tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things, you love a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something, you're losing sleep over tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things, I want to see — Okay. Aw@@ eso@@ me, tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things really matter.
So, I speci@@ alize in tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things because I believe that every single one of those 50 million tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things deserves to know what psycholog@@ ists, soci@@ olog@@ ists, neur@@ ologists and fertil@@ ity speci@@ alists already know@@ : that claim@@ ing your 20@@ s is one of the simpl@@ est, yet most transforma@@ tive, things you can do for work, for love, for your happiness, maybe even for the world.
This is not my opin@@ ion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments take place by age 3@@ 5.
That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and "A@@ ha@@ !" moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid-@@ 30@@ s.
People who are over 40, don't pan@@ ic.
This crowd is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to ear@@ n.
We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30.
We know that the brain cap@@ s off its second and last growth sp@@ ur@@ t in your 20@@ s as it re@@ wires itself for adul@@ tho@@ od, which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself, now is the time to change it.
We know that personality changes more during your 20@@ s than at any other time in life, and we know that female fertil@@ ity pe@@ aks at age 2@@ 8, and things get tricky after age 3@@ 5.
So your 20@@ s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options.
So when we think about child development, we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attach@@ ment in the brain.
It's a time when your ordin@@ ary, day@@ -to-@@ day life has an in@@ ordin@@ ate impact on who you will be@@ come.
But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing and our 20@@ s are that critical period of adult development.
But this isn't what tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things are hear@@ ing.
New@@ s@@ papers talk about the changing ti@@ met@@ able of adul@@ tho@@ od.
Resear@@ ch@@ ers call the 20@@ s an extended adolesc@@ ence.
Journ@@ alists coin silly nick@@ names for tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things like "@@ tw@@ ix@@ ter@@ s" and "@@ kid@@ ul@@ t@@ s."
It's tru@@ e!
As a culture, we have trivi@@ alized what is actually the defining decade of adul@@ tho@@ od.
Leon@@ ard Bern@@ stein said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not quite enough time.
Isn't that tru@@ e?
So what do you think happens when you p@@ at a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something on the head and you say, "You have 10 extra years to start your life@@ "?
Nothing happens.
You have rob@@ bed that person of his ur@@ gency and ambi@@ tion, and absolutely nothing happens.
And then every day, smart, interesting tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this: "I know my boy@@ friend's no good for me, but this relationship doesn't coun@@ t. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "@@ Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I'm 30, I'll be fin@@ e."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My 20@@ s are almost over, and I have nothing to show for myself.
I had a better r@@ és@@ um@@ é the day after I graduated from colle@@ ge."
And then it starts to sound like this: "D@@ ating in my 20@@ s was like musical chair@@ s.
Everybody was running around and having fun, but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down.
I didn't want to be the only one left standing up, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30@@ ."
Where are the tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things here?
Do not do that.
Okay, now that sounds a little fli@@ p, but make no mistak@@ e, the sta@@ kes are very high.
When a lot has been pushed to your 30@@ s, there is enormous thir@@ ty@@ something pressure to jum@@ p-@@ start a career, pick a city, partner up, and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time.
Many of these things are in@@ compati@@ ble, and as research is just starting to show, simply harder and more stress@@ ful to do all at once in our 30@@ s.
The post-@@ millenni@@ al mid@@ life crisis isn't buying a red sports car.
It's realizing you can't have that career you now want.
It's realizing you can't have that child you now want, or you can't give your child a sibl@@ ing.
Too many thir@@ ty@@ some@@ things and for@@ ty@@ some@@ things look at themselves, and at me, sitting across the room, and say about their 20@@ s, "What was I doing? What was I think@@ ing?"
I want to change what tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how that can go.
It's a story about a woman named Em@@ ma.
At 25, Emma came to my office because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis.
She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertain@@ ment, but she hadn't decided yet, so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead.
Because it was cheaper@@ , she lived with a boy@@ friend who dis@@ played his temp@@ er more than his ambi@@ tion.
And as hard as her 20@@ s were, her early life had been even hard@@ er.
She often cri@@ ed in our sess@@ ions, but then would collect herself by saying, "You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friend@@ s."
Well one day, Emma comes in and she hang@@ s her head in her lap@@ , and she so@@ b@@ bed for most of the hour.
S@@ he'd just bought a new address book, and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contac@@ ts, but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words "In case of emer@@ genc@@ y, please call ..."
She was nearly hy@@ ster@@ ical when she looked at me and said, "Who@@ 's going to be there for me if I get in a car wrec@@ k?
Who's going to take care of me if I have cancer@@ ?"
Now in that moment, it took everything I had not to say, "I will@@ ."
But what Emma needed wasn't some therap@@ ist who really, really car@@ ed.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.
I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Em@@ ma@@ 's defining decade went parad@@ ing by.
So over the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something, male or femal@@ e, deserves to hear@@ .
First, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital.
By "@@ get identity capital@@ ," I mean do something that adds value to who you are.
Do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next.
I didn't know the future of Em@@ ma@@ 's career, and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: Id@@ enti@@ ty capital be@@ gets identity capital.
So now is the time for that cross-@@ country job, that intern@@ ship, that startu@@ p you want to try.
I'm not dis@@ counting tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something exploration here, but I am dis@@ counting exploration that's not supposed to coun@@ t, which, by the way, is not exploration.
That's proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation.
I told Emma to explore work and make it coun@@ t.
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribe is over@@ r@@ ated.
Best friends are great for giving rid@@ es to the airport@@ , but tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things who h@@ ud@@ dle together with like@@ -@@ min@@ ded pe@@ ers limit who they know, what they know, how they think, how they speak, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle.
New things come from what are called our weak ties, our friends of friends of friends.
So yes, half of tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things are un@@ - or under-@@ employ@@ ed.
But half aren@@ 't, and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group.
Half of new jobs are never pos@@ ted, so reaching out to your neighbor@@ 's boss is how you get that un@@ posted job.
It's not che@@ ating. It's the science of how information spread@@ s.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.
Now this was true for her growing up, but as a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something, soon Emma would pick her family when she partner@@ ed with someone and created a family of her own.
I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now.
Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to set@@ tle down than 20, or even 25, and I agree with you.
But grab@@ bing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the ais@@ le is not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one, and that means being as inten@@ tional with love as you are with work.
Pic@@ king your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you.
So what happened to Em@@ ma?
Well, we went through that address book, and she found an old room@@ ma@@ te@@ 's cous@@ in who worked at an art museum in another state.
That weak tie helped her get a job there.
That job offer gave her the reason to leave that li@@ ve-@@ in boy@@ friend.
Now, five years later, she's a special events plan@@ ner for muse@@ um@@ s.
She's married to a man she mind@@ fully chos@@ e.
She loves her new career, she loves her new family, and she sent me a card that said, "@@ Now the emergency contact bl@@ anks don't seem big enough@@ ."
Now Em@@ ma@@ 's story made that sound easy, but that's what I love about working with tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things.
They are so easy to help.
Tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things are like airplan@@ es just leaving L@@ A@@ X, bound for somewhere w@@ est.
Right after take@@ off, a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alask@@ a or Fi@@ j@@ i.
Li@@ ke@@ wise, at 21 or 25 or even 2@@ 9, one good conversation, one good break, one good TED Tal@@ k, can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come.
So here's an idea worth spreading to every tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Ale@@ x.
It's what I now have the privilege of saying to tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things like Emma every single day@@ : Thir@@ ty is not the new 20, so claim your adul@@ tho@@ od, get some identity capital, use your weak ties, pick your family.
Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do.
You're deciding your life right now.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Le@@ aving a high-@@ flying job in consul@@ ting, Ang@@ ela Lee D@@ uck@@ worth took a job teaching math to seventh grad@@ ers in a New York public school. She quickly realized that I@@ Q wasn't the only thing separ@@ ating the successful students from those who strugg@@ led. Here, she explains her theory of "@@ grit@@ " as a predic@@ tor of success.
Ang@@ ela Lee D@@ uck@@ worth@@ : Gr@@ it: The power of passion and persever@@ ance.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very dem@@ anding job in management consul@@ ting for a job that was even more demand@@ ing: teach@@ ing.
I went to teach seventh grad@@ ers math in the New York City public schools.
And like any teacher, I made qu@@ iz@@ zes and test@@ s.
I gave out homework assign@@ ments.
When the work came back, I calculated grad@@ es.
What struck me was that I@@ Q was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of my strong@@ est perfor@@ mers did not have str@@ atos@@ pher@@ ic I@@ Q s@@ cores.
Some of my smar@@ test kids weren't doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard@@ : rati@@ os, deci@@ mal@@ s, the area of a parall@@ elo@@ gr@@ am.
But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough.
After several more years of teach@@ ing, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motiv@@ ational perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is I@@ Q.
But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and eas@@ il@@ y?
So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school to become a psycholog@@ ist.
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging sett@@ ings, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to West Poin@@ t Mil@@ it@@ ary Academ@@ y.
We tried to predict which cad@@ ets would stay in military training and which would drop out.
We went to the National Sp@@ elling Be@@ e and tried to predict which children would advance far@@ th@@ est in competition.
We studied ro@@ ok@@ ie teachers working in really tough neighborho@@ ods, asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year, and of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their student@@ s?
We partner@@ ed with private companies, asking, which of these sal@@ es@@ people is going to keep their job@@ s?
And who's going to earn the most money@@ ?
In all those very different contex@@ ts, one character@@ istic emerged as a significant predic@@ tor of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good loo@@ ks, physical health, and it wasn't I@@ Q.
It was gr@@ it.
Gri@@ t is passion and persever@@ ance for very long-term go@@ als.
Gri@@ t is having stam@@ ina.
Gri@@ t is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
Gri@@ t is living life like it's a marath@@ on, not a s@@ print.
A few years ago, I started studying gri@@ t in the Chicago public schools.
I asked thousands of high school j@@ uni@@ ors to take gri@@ t question@@ n@@ air@@ es, and then waited around more than a year to see who would gradu@@ ate.
Turns out that grit@@ ti@@ er kids were significantly more likely to gradu@@ ate, even when I matched them on every character@@ istic I could meas@@ ure, things like family income, standardiz@@ ed achiev@@ ement test s@@ cores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school.
So it's not just at West Poin@@ t or the National Sp@@ elling Be@@ e that gri@@ t matters.
It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out.
To me, the most shocking thing about gri@@ t is how little we know, how little science knows, about building it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I build gri@@ t in kid@@ s?
What do I do to teach kids a solid work eth@@ ic@@ ?
How do I keep them motivated for the long run@@ ?"
I don't know. What I do know is that talent doesn't make you grit@@ ty.
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commit@@ ments.
In fact, in our data, gri@@ t is usually un@@ related or even inver@@ sely related to measures of tal@@ ent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about building gri@@ t in kids is something called "@@ growth mind@@ set@@ ."
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Car@@ ol D@@ w@@ ec@@ k, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fix@@ ed, that it can change with your effort.
Dr. D@@ w@@ eck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to per@@ severe when they fa@@ il, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea for building gr@@ it.
But we need more.
And that's where I'm going to end my remark@@ s, because that's where we are.
That's the work that stands before us.
We need to take our best ideas, our strong@@ est intui@@ tions, and we need to test them.
We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fa@@ il, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons lear@@ ned.
In other words, we need to be grit@@ ty about getting our kids grit@@ ti@@ er.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For fore@@ ig@@ ners, learning to speak Chinese is a hard task. But learning to read the beautiful, often complex characters of the Chinese written language may be less difficult. Sh@@ a@@ o@@ L@@ an walks through a simple lesson in recognizing the ideas behind the characters and their meaning - building from a few simple forms to more complex concept@@ s. C@@ all it Chin@@ easy.
Sh@@ a@@ o@@ L@@ an: L@@ earn to read Chinese ... with eas@@ e!
Gro@@ wing up in Tai@@ wan as the daughter of a cal@@ li@@ grap@@ her, one of my most treas@@ ured memories was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of Chinese character@@ s.
E@@ ver since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But to an out@@ sid@@ er, it seems to be as im@@ penetr@@ able as the Great Wall of China.
Over the past few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this wall, so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.
I started thinking about how a new, fast method of learning Chinese might be useful.
Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequ@@ ence.
I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better that we have a fast and simpler way.
A Chinese schol@@ ar would understand 20,000 character@@ s.
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic liter@@ acy.
The top 200 will allow you to compreh@@ end 40 percent of basic literature - enough to read road sign@@ s, restaurant men@@ us, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the news@@ papers.
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.
You are ready?
Open your mouth as wide as possible until it's squar@@ e.
You get a mouth.
This is a person going for a walk.
Per@@ son.
If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sid@@ es, as if she was y@@ elling fran@@ tically, "H@@ el@@ p@@ ! I'm on fire@@ !" - This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the fl@@ ame, but I like to think that way. Wh@@ ic@@ he@@ ver works for you.
This is a tree.
Tre@@ e.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of sal@@ o@@ on doors in the wild w@@ est.
I call these eight characters radic@@ als.
They are the building blocks for you to create lots more character@@ s.
A person.
If someone walks behind, that is "@@ to follow@@ ."
As the old saying goes, two is company, three is a crow@@ d.
If a person stret@@ ched their arms wide, this person is saying, "It was this big@@ ."
The person inside the mouth, the person is tr@@ appe@@ d.
He's a prison@@ er, just like Jon@@ ah inside the whal@@ e.
One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the wo@@ ods.
Three trees together, we create the forest.
Put a plan@@ k underneath the tree, we have the found@@ ation.
Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "@@ idi@@ ot@@ ." Eas@@ y to remember, since a talking tree is pretty idio@@ tic.
Remember fire@@ ?
Two fires together, I get really hot.
Three fires together, that's a lot of flam@@ es.
S@@ et the fire underneath the two trees, it's bur@@ ning.
For us, the sun is the source of prosper@@ ity.
Two s@@ uns together, prosper@@ ous.
Three together, that's spar@@ k@@ les.
Put the sun and the moon shining together, it's brigh@@ t@@ ness.
It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.
The sun is coming up above the horiz@@ on. Sun@@ ris@@ e.
A door. Put a plan@@ k inside the door, it's a door bol@@ t.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
K@@ n@@ ock knoc@@ k. Is anyone home@@ ?
This person is sne@@ aking out of a door, escap@@ ing, ev@@ ad@@ ing.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they have an argument.
Three women together, be car@@ eful, it's adul@@ ter@@ y.
So we have gone through almost 30 character@@ s.
By using this meth@@ od, the first eight radic@@ als will allow you to build 3@@ 2.
The next group of eight characters will build an extra 3@@ 2.
So with very little effor@@ t, you will be able to learn a couple hundred character@@ s, which is the same as a Chinese eight-@@ year-@@ old.
So after we know the character@@ s, we start building phras@@ es.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have fire mountain. It's a volcan@@ o.
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun.
This is a sun placed with the orig@@ in, because Japan lies to the east of China.
So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we get?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stac@@ ked on top of each other.
In ancient China, that means in exi@@ le, because Chinese em@@ per@@ ors, they put their political enemies in ex@@ ile beyond mountain@@ s.
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays, ex@@ ile has turned into getting out.
A mouth which tells you where to get out is an ex@@ it.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage. Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When Col@@ in S@@ tok@@ es' 3@@ -year-old son caught a glimpse of "S@@ tar War@@ s," he was instantly obs@@ esse@@ d. But what messages did he absorb from the sci@@ -@@ fi class@@ ic@@ ? S@@ to@@ kes asks for more movies that send positive messages to bo@@ ys: that cooperation is hero@@ ic, and respec@@ ting women is as man@@ ly as defe@@ ating the vill@@ ain.
Col@@ in S@@ tok@@ es: How movies teach man@@ ho@@ od.
You know, my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch.
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids, and when my daughter was four, we got to watch "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ " together.
It totally dominated her imagination for months.
Her favorite character was G@@ lind@@ a, of course.
It gave her a great excuse to wear a spar@@ k@@ ly dress and carry a w@@ and.
But you watch that movie enough times, and you start to realize how unusual it is.
Now we live today, and are raising our children, in a kind of childr@@ en@@ '@@ s-@@ fantas@@ y-@@ spectac@@ ul@@ ar-@@ industrial complex.
But "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ " stood alone.
It did not start that tr@@ end.
For@@ ty years later was when the trend really caught on, with, interestingly, another movie that feature@@ d a metal guy and a fur@@ ry guy rescu@@ ing a girl by dr@@ essing up as the enem@@ y's guar@@ ds.
Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah.
Now, there's a big difference between these two movies, a couple of really big differences between "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ " and all the movies we watch today.
One is there's very little violence in "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ ."
The monkeys are rather aggress@@ ive, as are the apple trees.
But I think if "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ " were made today, the w@@ iz@@ ard would say, "D@@ or@@ o@@ th@@ y, you are the s@@ avi@@ or of O@@ z that the proph@@ ec@@ y for@@ et@@ old.
Use your magic sli@@ p@@ pers to defe@@ at the computer-@@ generated ar@@ mi@@ es of the W@@ ic@@ ked W@@ itch@@ ."
But that's not how it happens.
Another thing that's really unique about "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ " to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even vill@@ ain@@ ous characters are femal@@ e.
Now I started to notice this when I actually showed "S@@ tar War@@ s" to my daughter, which was years later, and the situation was different.
At that point I also had a son.
He was only three at the time.
He was not invited to the scre@@ en@@ ing. He was too young for that.
But he was the second child, and the level of super@@ vision had plum@@ me@@ ted. So he wand@@ ered in, and it im@@ printed on him like a mom@@ my d@@ uck does to its d@@ uck@@ ling, and I don't think he understands what's going on, but he is sure so@@ aking in it.
And I wonder what he's so@@ aking in.
Is he picking up on the them@@ es of courage and persever@@ ance and loy@@ al@@ ty?
Is he picking up on the fact that Lu@@ ke jo@@ ins an army to over@@ throw the government@@ ?
Is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for A@@ un@@ t Ber@@ u, and of course this princ@@ ess, who's really cool, but who kind of wa@@ its around through most of the movie so that she can a@@ ward the hero with a med@@ al and a win@@ k to thank him for saving the universe, which he does by the magic that he was born with@@ ?
Com@@ pare this to 193@@ 9 with "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ ."
How does Dor@@ othy win her movi@@ e?
By making friends with everybody and being a lead@@ er.
That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in - O@@ z, right? - and not the world of d@@ ud@@ es figh@@ ting, which is where we kind of have to be.
Why is there so much Force - capital F, Force - in the movies we have for our kids, and so little yellow br@@ ick road@@ ?
There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the bo@@ y-@@ violent movie has on girls, and you should do that read@@ ing. It's very good.
I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vi@@ be.
I know from my own experience that Princ@@ ess Le@@ ia did not provide the adequ@@ ate context that I could have used in navig@@ ating the adult world that is co-@@ ed. I think there was a first-@@ kiss moment when I really expected the cred@@ its to start rolling because that's the end of the movie, right?
I finished my quest@@ , I got the girl.
Why are you still standing there?
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
The movies are very, very focused on defe@@ ating the vill@@ ain and getting your re@@ ward, and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journe@@ ys.
It's almost as though if you're a boy, you are a do@@ pe@@ y animal, and if you are a girl, you should bring your warri@@ or costum@@ e.
There are plenty of excep@@ tions, and I will defend the Disney princ@@ esses in front of any you.
But they do send a message to boys, that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.
They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patri@@ arch@@ y, but they are not necessarily showing boys how they're supposed to defend against the patri@@ arch@@ y.
There's no models for them.
And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids, and as three-dimensional and del@@ ight@@ ful as Her@@ mi@@ one and Kat@@ n@@ is@@ s are, these are still war movies.
And, of course, the most successful studio of all time continues to cr@@ ank out classic after class@@ ic, every single one of them about the journey of a boy, or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a little girl.
Un@@ til, as many of you are thinking, this year, when they finally came out with "@@ Br@@ av@@ e."
I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now.
Do you remember what the cri@@ tics said when "@@ Br@@ av@@ e" came out?
"A@@ w, I can't believe Pix@@ ar made a princ@@ ess mo@@ vie@@ ."
It's very good. Don't let that stop you.
Now, almost none of these movies pass the Be@@ ch@@ del T@@ est.
I don't know if you've heard of this.
It has not yet caught on and caught fire, but maybe today we will start a movement.
Al@@ ison Be@@ ch@@ del is a comic book artist, and back in the mid-@@ '80s, she recorded this conversation she'd had with a friend about ass@@ essing the movies that they saw.
And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask@@ : Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lin@@ es?
So try to meet that bar.
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movi@@ e?
And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like? Right? Thank you. Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.
It does happen. I've seen it, and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very high-@@ quality movie, "@@ Ar@@ go."
Right? Oscar bu@@ z@@ z, doing great at the box office, a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.
It pretty much fl@@ un@@ ks the Be@@ ch@@ del test.
And I don't think it shoul@@ d, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie takes place in this emb@@ ass@@ y where men and women are hiding out during the hos@@ t@@ age crisis.
We've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep, ang@@ st-@@ rid@@ den conversations in this h@@ ide@@ out, and the great moment for one of the ac@@ tr@@ esses is to pe@@ ek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey@@ ?"
That's Hollywood for you.
So let's look at the numbers.
2011, of the 100 most popular movies, how many of them do you think actually have female protagon@@ ist@@ s?
E@@ lev@@ en. It's not bad.
It's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elected to Congr@@ ess, so that's good.
But there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring this room down.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
Here's what it said.
One out of five women in America say that they have been sexually assaul@@ ted some time in their life.
Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertain@@ ment.
I don't think kid@@ s' movies have anything to do with that.
I don't even think that music videos or porno@@ graphy are really directly related to that, but something is going wrong, and when I hear that statis@@ tic, one of the things I think of is that's a lot of sexual assa@@ il@@ ants.
Who are these gu@@ ys@@ ? What are they lear@@ n@@ ing?
What are they failing to lear@@ n@@ ?
Are they absor@@ bing the story that a male hero@@ 's job is to defe@@ at the vill@@ ain with violence and then collect the re@@ ward, which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't speak@@ ?
Are we so@@ aking up that stor@@ y?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this stati@@ stic very alarm@@ ing and we want to prepare them.
We have tools at our dispos@@ al like "@@ girl power@@ ," and we hope that that will help, but I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them if, at the same time, actively or passi@@ vely, we are training our sons to maintain their boy power@@ ?
I mean, I think the Netfli@@ x que@@ ue is one way that we can do something very important, and I'm talking mainly to the dad@@ s here.
I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of man@@ ho@@ od.
The definition of man@@ hood is already turning upside down.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregi@@ ver and wage ear@@ ner.
They're throwing it up in the air.
So our sons are going to have to find some way of adap@@ ting to this, some new relationship with each other, and I think we really have to show them, and model for them, how a real man is someone who trus@@ ts his sisters and respec@@ ts them, and wants to be on their team, and stands up against the real bad guys, who are the men who want to abuse the women.
And I think our job in the Netfli@@ x que@@ ue is to look out for those movies that pass the Be@@ ch@@ del T@@ est, if we can find them, and to seek out the hero@@ ines who are there, who show real cour@@ age, who bring people together, and to nud@@ ge our sons to identify with those hero@@ ines and to say, "I want to be on their team@@ ," because they're going to be on their team.
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "S@@ tar War@@ s," do you know what she sa@@ id@@ ?
O@@ bi@@ -@@ W@@ an.
O@@ bi@@ -@@ W@@ an Ken@@ ob@@ i and G@@ linda.
What do these two have in common@@ ?
Maybe it's not just the spar@@ k@@ ly dr@@ ess.
I think these people are exper@@ ts.
I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else, and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
Now, they are leaders.
I like that kind of quest for my daughter, and I like that kind of quest for my son.
I want more quest@@ s like that.
I want fewer quest@@ s where my son is told, "G@@ o out and fight it al@@ one@@ ," and more quest@@ s where he sees that it's his job to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people become better and be better people, like the W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this short talk, TED Fellow Sarah Par@@ ca@@ k introduc@@ es the field of "@@ space archae@@ olog@@ y" - using satellite images to search for clues to the lost sites of past civiliz@@ ations.
Sarah Par@@ ca@@ k: Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ology from space.
When I was a child growing up in M@@ ain@@ e, one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the se@@ ash@@ ores of M@@ ain@@ e, because my parents told me it would bring me luc@@ k.
But you know, these sh@@ ell@@ s, they're hard to find.
They're covered in sand, they're difficult to see.
However, over time, I got used to looking for them.
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them.
This grew into a passion for finding things, a love for the past and archae@@ ology.
And eventually, when I started studying Eg@@ y@@ pt@@ ology, I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough.
Because all of the sudden, in Egyp@@ t, my beach had grown from a tiny beach in M@@ aine to one eight hundred miles long, next to the Ni@@ le.
And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what brought me to using satellite imag@@ ery.
For trying to map the past, I knew that I had to see differently.
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infr@@ ar@@ ed.
This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian del@@ ta called Men@@ des.
And the site vis@@ ib@@ ly appears bro@@ wn, but when we use the infrared and we process it, all of the sudden, using false color, the site appears as bright pin@@ k.
What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient Egypti@@ ans.
What I want to share with you today is how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y, missing for thousands of years.
It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y was ancient Egyp@@ t's capital for over four hundred years, at a period of time called the Middle King@@ dom, about four thousand years ago.
The site is located in the F@@ ai@@ y@@ um of Egyp@@ t, and the site is really important, because in the Middle King@@ dom there was this great ren@@ aiss@@ ance for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
Eg@@ y@@ pt@@ ologists have always known the site of It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y was located somewhere near the pyram@@ ids of the two k@@ ings who built it, indic@@ ated within the red circles here, but somewhere within this massive f@@ lood pl@@ ain.
This area is huge - it's four miles by three miles in size.
The N@@ ile used to flow right next to the city of It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y, and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the eas@@ t, it covered over the city.
So, how do you find a buried city in a vast landsca@@ pe@@ ?
F@@ inding it randomly would be the equivalent of loc@@ ating a needle in a h@@ ay@@ stac@@ k, blind@@ fol@@ ded, wearing baseball mit@@ ts.
So what we did is we used NASA topo@@ graphy data to map out the landscape, very subtle changes.
We started to be able to see where the N@@ ile used to flow@@ .
But you can see in more deta@@ il, and even more interesting, this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y.
So we collabor@@ ated with Egyptian scientists to do cor@@ ing work, which you see here.
When I say cor@@ ing, it's like ice cor@@ ing, but instead of layers of climate change, you're looking for layers of human occup@@ ation.
And, five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mu@@ d, we found a dense layer of pot@@ ter@@ y.
What this shows is that at this possible location of It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y, five meters down, we have a layer of occup@@ ation for several hundred years, dating to the Middle King@@ dom, dating to the exact period of time we think It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y is.
We also found work stone - car@@ n@@ eli@@ an, quar@@ tz and ag@@ ate that shows that there was a jewel@@ er's work@@ shop here.
These might not look like much, but when you think about the most common stones used in jewel@@ ry from the Middle King@@ dom, these are the stones that were used.
So, we have a dense layer of occup@@ ation dating to the Middle King@@ dom at this site.
We also have evidence of an elite jewel@@ er's worksho@@ p, showing that whatever was there was a very important city.
No It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y was here yet, but we're going to be returning to the site in the near future to map it out.
And even more importantly, we have funding to train young Egypti@@ ans in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well.
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle King@@ dom - it was probably written at the city of It@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y four thousand years ago.
"S@@ har@@ ing knowledge is the greatest of all call@@ ings.
There's nothing like it in the land@@ ."
So as it turns out, TED was not founded in 1984 A@@ D.
Ma@@ king ideas actually started in 1984 BC at a not@@ -l@@ os@@ t-@@ for@@ -long city, found from abo@@ ve.
It certainly puts finding se@@ ash@@ ells by the seas@@ hor@@ e in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: There are people who can quickly memor@@ ize lists of thousands of numbers, the order of all the cards in a deck , and much more. Science writer Joshua Fo@@ er describes the technique - called the memory pal@@ ace - and shows off its most remarkable feature@@ : anyone can learn how to use it, including him.
Joshua Fo@@ er: Fe@@ ats of memory anyone can do.
I'd like to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home.
I'd like you to notice the color of the door, the material that it's made out of.
Now visualize a pack of over@@ weight nud@@ ists on bicy@@ cles.
They are competing in a naked bicycle race, and they are headed straight for your front door.
I need you to actually see this.
They are ped@@ aling really hard, they're sweat@@ y, they're bounc@@ ing around a lot.
And they crash straight into the front door of your home.
B@@ ic@@ y@@ cles fly everywhere, whe@@ els roll past you, spo@@ kes end up in awkward places.
Ste@@ p over the threshold of your door into your fo@@ y@@ er, your hall@@ way, whate@@ ver@@ 's on the other side, and appreciate the quality of the light.
The light is shining down on Co@@ ok@@ ie Mon@@ st@@ er.
Co@@ ok@@ ie Mon@@ ster is wav@@ ing at you from his per@@ ch on top of a tan hor@@ se.
It's a talking hor@@ se.
You can practically feel his blue fur tick@@ ling your nos@@ e.
You can smell the o@@ at@@ meal rais@@ in cook@@ ie that he's about to sho@@ vel into his mouth.
Wal@@ k past him into your living room.
In your living room, in full imagin@@ ative broad@@ b@@ and, picture Brit@@ ney Spe@@ ars.
She is scan@@ ti@@ ly cl@@ ad, she's dancing on your coffee table, and she's singing "H@@ it Me Bab@@ y One More Ti@@ me."
And then, follow me into your kitch@@ en.
In your kitchen, the floor has been pav@@ ed over with a yellow br@@ ick road, and out of your o@@ ven are coming towards you Dor@@ o@@ th@@ y, the T@@ in M@@ an, the S@@ car@@ ec@@ row and the L@@ ion from "The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z@@ ," hand-@@ in-@@ hand, ski@@ pping straight towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a very bizarre cont@@ est that is held every spring in New York City.
It's called the United States Mem@@ ory Ch@@ amp@@ ion@@ ship.
And I had gone to cover this cont@@ est a few years back as a science journalist, expect@@ ing, I guess, that this was going to be like the Super@@ bowl of sav@@ ants.
This was a bunch of guys and a few l@@ adi@@ es, widely var@@ ying in both age and hy@@ gi@@ en@@ ic up@@ keep@@ .
They were memor@@ izing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once.
They were memor@@ izing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strang@@ ers.
They were memor@@ izing entire poems in just a few minutes.
They were competing to see who could memor@@ ize the order of a shu@@ ff@@ led pack of playing cards the fas@@ test.
I was like, this is unbeliev@@ able.
These people must be fre@@ aks of nature.
And I started talking to a few of the competi@@ tors.
This is a guy called Ed Co@@ ok, who had come over from England, where he had one of the best-@@ trained memor@@ ies.
And I said to him, "E@@ d, when did you realize that you were a sav@@ ant@@ ?"
And Ed was like, "I'm not a sav@@ ant.
In fact, I have just an average memory.
Everybody who compe@@ tes in this cont@@ est will tell you that they have just an average memory.
We've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miracul@@ ous fe@@ ats of memory using a set of ancient techni@@ ques, techniques invented 2,@@ 500 years ago in Gre@@ ec@@ e, the same techniques that C@@ ic@@ ero had used to memor@@ ize his spee@@ ches, that medieval schol@@ ars had used to memor@@ ize entire book@@ s."
And I said, "Who@@ a. How come I never heard of this befor@@ e?"
And we were standing outside the competition h@@ all, and E@@ d, who is a wonderful, brilli@@ ant, but somewhat ec@@ centr@@ ic English guy, says to me, "@@ Jos@@ h, you're an American journal@@ ist.
Do you know Brit@@ ney Spe@@ ar@@ s?"
I'm like, "Wh@@ at? No. Wh@@ y?"
"@@ Because I really want to teach Brit@@ ney Spe@@ ars how to memor@@ ize the order of a shu@@ ff@@ led pack of playing cards on U.S. national television.
It will prove to the world that anybody can do this."
I was like, "Well, I'm not Brit@@ ney Spe@@ ars, but maybe you could teach me.
I mean, you've got to start somewhere, right@@ ?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory, but also investig@@ ating it, trying to understand how it works, why it sometimes doesn't work, and what its potential might be.
And I met a host of really interesting people.
This is a guy called E.@@ P.
He's an am@@ nes@@ ic who had, very possi@@ bly, the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad, that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem, which is amazing.
And he was this incredibly tragic fig@@ ure, but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are.
At the other end of the spectr@@ um, I met this guy.
This is Kim Pe@@ e@@ k, he was the basis for D@@ us@@ tin H@@ off@@ man's character in the movie "R@@ ain Man@@ ."
We spent an afternoon together in the Sal@@ t Lake City Public Library memor@@ izing phone books, which was s@@ cintil@@ lat@@ ing.
And I went back and I read a whole host of memory tre@@ atis@@ es, tre@@ atis@@ es written 2@@ ,000-@@ plus years ago in Lat@@ in, in antiqu@@ ity, and then later, in the Middle Ag@@ es.
And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff.
One of the really interesting things that I learned is that once upon a time, this idea of having a train@@ ed, disciplin@@ ed, cultiv@@ ated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today.
Once upon a time, people invested in their memor@@ ies, in labor@@ i@@ ously fur@@ n@@ ishing their minds.
Over the last few millen@@ ia, we've invented a series of technologies - from the alphab@@ et, to the scr@@ ol@@ l, to the co@@ de@@ x, the printing press, photograph@@ y, the computer, the smartphone - that have made it progress@@ ively easier and easier for us to extern@@ alize our memor@@ ies, for us to essentially out@@ source this fundamental human capacity.
These technologies have made our modern world possible, but they've also changed us.
They've changed us cultur@@ ally, and I would argue that they've changed us cogni@@ tively.
Having little need to remember anymore, it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how.
One of the last places on Earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a train@@ ed, disciplin@@ ed, cultiv@@ ated memory, is at this totally singular memory cont@@ est.
It's actually not that sing@@ ular, there are cont@@ ests held all over the world.
And I was fascin@@ ated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it.
A few years back a group of researchers at University College London brought a bunch of memory cham@@ p@@ ions into the lab.
They wanted to know@@ : Do these guys have brains that are somehow struc@@ tur@@ ally, anatom@@ ically different from the rest of our@@ s?
The answer was no.
Are they smarter than the rest of us?
They gave them a bunch of cognitive test@@ s, and the answer was: not really.
There was, however, one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory cham@@ p@@ ions and the control subjects that they were comparing them to.
When they put these guys in an f@@ MRI machine, scan@@ ned their brains while they were memor@@ izing numbers and people's faces and pictures of snow@@ fl@@ ak@@ es, they found that the memory cham@@ p@@ ions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else.
Of note, they were using, or they seemed to be using, a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navig@@ ation.
Why? And is there something that the rest of us can learn from this?
The s@@ port of competitive memor@@ izing is driven by a kind of arms race where, every year, somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly, and then the rest of the field has to play cat@@ ch@@ -@@ up.
This is my friend Ben Pr@@ id@@ more, three-@@ time world memory cham@@ p@@ ion.
On his desk in front of him are 36 shu@@ ff@@ led pac@@ ks of playing cards that he is about to try to memor@@ ize in one hour, using a technique that he invented and he alone has master@@ ed.
He used a similar technique to memor@@ ize the precise order of 4,@@ 140 random binary dig@@ its in half an hour.
Yeah.
And while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competi@@ tions, everything, all of the techniques that are being used, ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as "@@ elabor@@ ative en@@ co@@ d@@ ing."
And it's well-@@ illustr@@ ated by a ni@@ f@@ ty paradox known as the Bak@@ er@@ /@@ ba@@ ker paradox@@ , which goes like this: If I tell two people to remember the same word, if I say to you, "@@ Remember that there is a guy named Bak@@ er."
That's his name.
And I say to you, "@@ Remember that there is a guy who is a ba@@ k@@ er."
And I come back to you at some point later on, and I say, "Do you remember that word that I told you a while back@@ ?
Do you remember what it was@@ ?"
The person who was told his name is Bak@@ er is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is a ba@@ k@@ er.
Same word, different amount of remember@@ ing; that's weir@@ d.
What's going on here?
Well, the name Bak@@ er doesn't actually mean anything to you.
It is entirely un@@ te@@ thered from all of the other memories But the common n@@ ou@@ n "@@ ba@@ ker@@ " - we know ba@@ k@@ ers.
Bak@@ ers wear funny white h@@ ats.
Bak@@ ers have fl@@ our on their hands.
Bak@@ ers smell good when they come home from work.
Maybe we even know a ba@@ k@@ er.
And when we first hear that word, we start putting these associ@@ ational hoo@@ ks into it, that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date.
The entire art of what is going on in these memory cont@@ est@@ s, and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life, is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bak@@ ers into low@@ er-@@ case B ba@@ kers - to take information that is lac@@ king in context, in signific@@ ance, in meaning, and transform it in some way, so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind.
One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this d@@ ates back 2,@@ 500 years to A@@ nci@@ ent Gre@@ ec@@ e.
It came to be known as the memory pal@@ ac@@ e.
The story behind its creation goes like this: There was a poet called Sim@@ on@@ ides, who was att@@ ending a banqu@@ et.
He was actually the hired entertain@@ ment, because back then, if you wanted to throw a really sl@@ am@@ ming party, you didn't hire a D.@@ J@@ ., you hired a po@@ et.
And he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door, and at the moment he does, the banqu@@ et hall collap@@ ses.
K@@ ills everybody inside.
It doesn't just kill everybody, it man@@ g@@ les the bodies beyond all recogni@@ tion.
Nobody can say who was inside, nobody can say where they were sit@@ ting.
The bodies can't be properly buri@@ ed.
It's one tragedy comp@@ ounding another.
Sim@@ on@@ ides, standing outside, the so@@ le surviv@@ or am@@ id the w@@ reck@@ age, clos@@ es his eyes and has this realiz@@ ation, which is that in his mind@@ 's eye, he can see where each of the gu@@ ests at the banqu@@ et had been sit@@ ting.
And he takes the relativ@@ es by the hand, and gu@@ ides them each to their loved ones am@@ id the w@@ reck@@ age.
What Sim@@ on@@ ides figured out at that moment, is something that I think we all kind of intuiti@@ vely know, which is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers, and wor@@ d-@@ for-@@ word instructions from our colleagues, we have really excep@@ tional visual and spatial memor@@ ies.
If I asked you to re@@ count the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Sim@@ on@@ ides, chances are you would have a tough time with it.
But, I would w@@ ager that if I asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse in your fo@@ y@@ er right now, you would be able to see that.
The idea behind the memory pal@@ ace is to create this imagined edi@@ fic@@ e in your mind@@ 's eye, and popul@@ ate it with images of the things that you want to remember - the craz@@ ier, weir@@ der, more bizar@@ re, fun@@ ni@@ er, ra@@ un@@ chi@@ er, st@@ ink@@ ier the image is, the more un@@ for@@ get@@ table it's likely to be.
This is advice that goes back 2@@ ,000-@@ plus years to the earliest Latin memory tre@@ atis@@ es.
So how does this work?
Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech, and you want to do it from memory, and you want to do it the way that C@@ ic@@ ero would have done it, if he had been invited to TEDx@@ Rome 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house.
And you'd come up with some sort of crazy, ridicul@@ ous, un@@ for@@ get@@ table image, to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre cont@@ est.
And then you'd go inside your house, and you would see an image of Co@@ ok@@ ie Mon@@ ster on top of Mis@@ ter E@@ d.
And that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Co@@ ok.
And then you'd see an image of Brit@@ ney Spe@@ ars to remind you of this funny anecdo@@ te you want to tel@@ l.
And you'd go into your kitchen, and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year, and you'd have some friends to help you remember that.
This is how Roman or@@ ators memor@@ ized their spee@@ ches - not wor@@ d-@@ for-@@ word, which is just going to scre@@ w you up, but topic@@ -@@ for-@@ topic@@ .
In fact, the phrase "@@ topic sent@@ ence@@ " - that comes from the Greek word "@@ to@@ pos@@ ," which means "@@ plac@@ e."
That's a vesti@@ ge of when people used to think about or@@ atory and rhetor@@ ic in these sorts of spatial terms.
The phrase "@@ in the first plac@@ e," that's like "@@ in the first place of your memory pal@@ ace@@ ."
I thought this was just fascin@@ ating, and I got really into it.
And I went to a few more of these memory cont@@ est@@ s, and I had this notion that I might write something longer about this sub@@ culture of competitive memoriz@@ ers.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory cont@@ est is a path@@ olog@@ ically boring event.
Tr@@ ul@@ y, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the S@@ AT@@ s - I mean, the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts mass@@ aging their templ@@ es.
And I'm a journalist, I need something to write about.
I know that there's incredible stuff happening in these people's minds, but I don't have access to it.
And I realized, if I was going to tell this story, I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit.
And so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat down with my New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe it was a po@@ em, maybe it was names from an old year@@ book that I bought at a fle@@ a market.
And I found that this was shock@@ ingly fun.
I never would have expected that.
It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory.
What you're doing, is you're trying to get better and better at cre@@ ating, at dream@@ ing up, these utterly lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous, ra@@ un@@ ch@@ y, hilari@@ ous, and hopefully un@@ for@@ get@@ table images in your mind@@ 's eye.
And I got pretty into it.
This is me wearing my standard competitive memoriz@@ er's training k@@ it.
It's a pair of ear@@ mu@@ ff@@ s and a set of safety go@@ gg@@ les that have been mas@@ ked over except for two small p@@ inh@@ ol@@ es, because distrac@@ tion is the competitive memoriz@@ er's greatest enem@@ y.
I ended up coming back to that same cont@@ est that I had covered a year earlier, and I had this notion that I might enter it, sort of as an experiment in particip@@ atory journ@@ alism.
It@@ 'd make, I thought, maybe a nice ep@@ ilo@@ gue to all my research.
Pro@@ bl@@ em was, the experiment went h@@ ay@@ wi@@ re.
I won the cont@@ est - which really wasn't supposed to happen.
Now, it is nice to be able to memor@@ ize spee@@ ches and phone numbers and shopping list@@ s, but it's actually kind of beside the point.
These are just trick@@ s.
They work because they're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work.
And you don't have to be building memory pal@@ ac@@ es or memor@@ izing pac@@ ks of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an inn@@ ate gif@@ t, but that is not the case.
Great memories are lear@@ ned.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we are deeply engag@@ ed.
We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience, and figure out why it is meaningful to us, why it is signific@@ ant, why it's color@@ ful, when we're able to transform it in some way that makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds, when we're able to transform Bak@@ ers into ba@@ k@@ ers.
The memory pal@@ ace, these memory techniques - they're just short@@ cut@@ s.
In fact, they're not even really short@@ cut@@ s.
They work because they make you work.
They force a kind of depth of process@@ ing, a kind of mind@@ ful@@ ness, that most of us don't normally walk around exercis@@ ing.
But there actually are no short@@ cut@@ s.
This is how stuff is made memor@@ able.
And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with, it's what E.@@ P@@ ., the am@@ nes@@ ic who couldn't even remember he had a memory problem, left me with, which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memor@@ ies.
How much are we willing to lose from our already short lives, by losing ourselves in our Black@@ ber@@ ri@@ es, our iP@@ hon@@ es, by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us, by being so laz@@ y that we're not willing to process dee@@ pl@@ y?
I learned fir@@ s@@ thand that there are incredible memory capac@@ ities lat@@ ent in all of us.
But if you want to live a memor@@ able life, you have to be the kind of person who remem@@ bers to remem@@ ber.
Thank you.

Because 30 years ago, I'm from Jerse@@ y, and I was six, and I lived there in my parent@@ s' house in a town called Liv@@ ing@@ st@@ on, and this was my childhood bedro@@ om.
Around the corner from my bedro@@ om was the bath@@ room that I used to share with my sis@@ ter.
And in between my bedro@@ om and the bath@@ room was a balcon@@ y that over@@ looked the family room.
And that's where everyone would hang out and watch TV, so that every time that I walked from my bedro@@ om to the bathro@@ om, everyone would see me, and every time I took a sho@@ wer and would come back in a tow@@ el, everyone would see me.
And I looked like this.
I was awk@@ ward, insec@@ ure, and I hated it.
I hated that walk, I hated that balcon@@ y, I hated that room, and I hated that house.
And that's architecture.
D@@ one.
That feeling, those emotions that I fel@@ t, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math and it's not about zon@@ ing, it's about those viscer@@ al, emotional connections that we feel to the places that we occup@@ y.
And it's no surprise that we feel that way, because according to the E@@ PA, Americans spend 90 percent of their time indo@@ ors.
That's 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture.
That's hu@@ ge.
That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realiz@@ e.
That makes us a little bit gul@@ li@@ ble and very, very predic@@ table.
It means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think@@ : You think "@@ power@@ " and "@@ stabil@@ ity" and "@@ democrac@@ y."
And I know you think that because it's based on a building that was build 2,@@ 500 years ago by the Gree@@ ks.
This is a tric@@ k.
This is a trigger that architects use to get you to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of.
It's a predictable emotional connection, and we've been using this trick for a long, long time.
We used it [@@ 200@@ ] years ago to build ban@@ ks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art muse@@ um@@ s.
And in the 20th century in America, we used it to build hous@@ es.
And look at these sol@@ id, stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elem@@ ents.
This is really, really use@@ ful, because building things is terri@@ f@@ ying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
And the people that build things - developer@@ s and governments - they're naturally afraid of innovation, and they'd rather just use those forms that they know you'll respond to.
That's how we end up with buildings like this.
This is a nice building.
This is the Liv@@ ing@@ st@@ on Public Library that was completed in 2004 in my home@@ town, and, you know, it's got a do@@ me and it's got this round thing and colum@@ ns, red br@@ ick, and you can kind of guess what Liv@@ ing@@ st@@ on is trying to say with this build@@ ing: children, property values and history.
But it doesn't have much to do with what a library actually does today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, another library was comple@@ ted, and it looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library is about how we consume media in a digital age.
It's about a new kind of public am@@ en@@ ity for the city, a place to gather and read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libr@@ aries, look so completely different@@ ?
And the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pen@@ dul@@ um.
On the one side is innovation, and architects are constantly pus@@ h@@ ing, pushing for new technologies, new ty@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ es, new solutions for the way that we live today.
And we push and we push and we push until we completely alien@@ ate all of you.
We wear all black, we get very depres@@ sed, you think we're ador@@ able, we're dead inside because we've got no choice.
We have to go to the other side and re@@ engage those symbols that we know you love.
So we do that, and you're happy, we feel like sell@@ out@@ s, so we start experiment@@ ing again and we push the pen@@ dul@@ um back and back and forth and back and forth we've gone for the last 300 years, and certainly for the last 30 years.
Okay, 30 years ago we were coming out of the '70@@ s.
Architec@@ ts had been busy experiment@@ ing with something called brut@@ alism.
It's about concre@@ te.
You can guess this.
S@@ mall windo@@ ws, de@@ human@@ izing scale.
This is really tough stuff.
So as we get closer to the '80s, we start to re@@ engage those symbol@@ s.
We push the pen@@ dul@@ um back into the other direction.
We take these forms that we know you love and we update them.
We add ne@@ on and we add pas@@ tel@@ s and we use new materials.
And you love it.
And we can't give you enough of it.
We take Chi@@ p@@ pend@@ ale ar@@ mo@@ ire@@ s and we turned those into sk@@ ys@@ cr@@ aper@@ s, and sk@@ ys@@ cr@@ aper@@ s can be medieval cas@@ t@@ les made out of glass.
For@@ ms got big, forms got bold and color@@ ful.
D@@ war@@ ves became colum@@ ns.
S@@ wan@@ s grew to the size of buildings.
It was crazy.
But it's the '80s, it's cool.
We're all hanging out in m@@ alls and we're all moving to the suburb@@ s, and out there, out in the suburb@@ s, we can create our own architectural fantas@@ ies.
And those fantas@@ ies, they can be Mediterr@@ ane@@ an or French or Ital@@ i@@ an.
Pos@@ si@@ bly with endless bread@@ stic@@ ks.
This is the thing about post@@ modern@@ ism.
This is the thing about symbol@@ s.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of making places, we're making memories of places.
Because I know, and I know all of you know, this isn't T@@ us@@ can@@ y.
This is O@@ hi@@ o.
So architects get frustr@@ ated, and we start pushing the pen@@ dul@@ um back into the other direction.
In the late '80@@ s and early '90s, we start experiment@@ ing with something called de@@ construc@@ tiv@@ ism.
We throw out historical symbol@@ s, we rely on new, computer-@@ a@@ id@@ ed design techni@@ ques, and we come up with new com@@ posi@@ tions, forms crash@@ ing into forms.
This is academic and head@@ y stuff, it's super un@@ popular, we totally alien@@ ate you.
Or@@ din@@ ar@@ ily, the pen@@ dul@@ um would just s@@ wing back into the other direction.
And then, something amazing happened.
In 1997, this building open@@ ed.
This is the G@@ ug@@ gen@@ he@@ im Bil@@ ba@@ o, by Frank Ge@@ hr@@ y.
And this building fundamentally changes the world's relationship to architecture.
Paul Gold@@ ber@@ ger said that Bil@@ b@@ ao was one of those rare moments when cri@@ tics, academ@@ ics, and the general public were completely uni@@ ted around a building.
The New York Times called this building a mirac@@ le.
T@@ our@@ ism in Bil@@ b@@ ao increased 2,@@ 500 percent after this building was comple@@ ted.
So all of a sudden, everybody wants one of these build@@ ing@@ s: L.@@ A@@ ., Seattle, Chicago, New York, Clevel@@ and, Spr@@ ing@@ field.
Everybody wants one, and Ge@@ h@@ ry is everywhere.
He is our very first star@@ chi@@ tec@@ t.
Now, how is it possible that these forms - they're wild and radical - how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world?
And it happened because media so successfully gal@@ van@@ ized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tour@@ ism.
We created an emotional reaction to these forms.
So did every mayor in the world.
So every mayor knew that if they had these forms, they had culture and tour@@ ism.
This phenomenon at the turn of the new millenni@@ um happened to a few other star@@ chi@@ tec@@ ts.
It happened to Z@@ a@@ ha and it happened to Lib@@ es@@ kind, and what happened to these elite few architects at the turn of the new millenni@@ um could actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture, as digital media starts to increase the speed with which we consume information.
Because think about how you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building.
Trans@@ port@@ ation spe@@ eds up@@ : You can take a boat, you can take a plane, you can be a tour@@ ist.
Technology spe@@ eds up@@ : You can see it in a newspaper, on TV, until finally, we are all architectural photograp@@ her@@ s, and the building has become dis@@ embodied from the site.
Architec@@ ture is everywhere now, and that means that the speed of communication has finally caught up to the speed of architecture.
Because architecture actually moves quite quickly.
It doesn't take long to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years, and in the inter@@ im, an architect will design two or eight or a hundred other buildings before they know if that building that they designed four years ago was a success or not.
That's because there's never been a good feedback loop in architecture.
That's how we end up with buildings like this.
Br@@ ut@@ alism wasn't a two-@@ year movement, it was a 20@@ -year movement.
For 20 years, we were producing buildings like this because we had no idea how much you hated it.
It's never going to happen again, I think, because we are living on the ver@@ ge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concre@@ te, of ste@@ el, or of the elev@@ ator, and it's a media revolution.
So my theory is that when you apply media to this pen@@ dul@@ um, it starts sw@@ inging faster and faster, until it's at both extre@@ mes nearly simultane@@ ously, and that effectively blur@@ s the difference between innovation and symbol@@ , between us, the architec@@ ts, and you, the public.
Now we can make nearly instantane@@ ous, emotionally charged symbols out of something that's brand new.
Let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently comple@@ ted.
We were hired to replace this building, which burned down.
This is the center of a town called the P@@ ines in F@@ ire Island in New York Sta@@ te.
It's a vac@@ ation community.
We proposed a building that was audaci@@ ous, that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to, and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scar@@ ed, so we created a series of pho@@ tor@@ e@@ alistic rend@@ er@@ ings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto In@@ st@@ agr@@ am, and we let people start to do what they do: share it, com@@ ment, like it, hate it.
But that meant that two years before the building was comple@@ te, it was already a part of the community, so that when the rend@@ er@@ ings looked exactly like the finished product, there were no surpris@@ es.
This building was already a part of this community, and then that first summer, when people started arri@@ ving and sharing the building on social media, the building ce@@ ased to be just an edi@@ fic@@ e and it became media, because these, these are not just pictures of a building, they're your pictures of a building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of your personal narr@@ ative, and what you're doing is you're short-@@ circu@@ iting all of our collective memory, and you're making these charged symbols for us to understand.
That means we don't need the Gree@@ ks anymore to tell us what to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't just changed the relationship between all of us, it's changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second about those libr@@ arians back in Liv@@ ing@@ st@@ on.
If that building was going to be built today, the first thing they would do is go online and search "@@ new libr@@ ari@@ es."
They would be bombar@@ ded by examples of experiment@@ ation, of innovation, of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be.
That's am@@ mun@@ i@@ tion.
That's am@@ mun@@ ition that they can take with them to the mayor of Liv@@ ing@@ st@@ on, to the people of Liv@@ ing@@ st@@ on, and say, there's no one answer to what a library is today.
Let's be a part of this.
This abundance of experiment@@ ation gives them the freedom to run their own experiment.
Everything is different now.
Architec@@ ts are no longer these mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated draw@@ ings, and you aren't the ha@@ pl@@ ess public, the consumer that won't accept anything that they haven't seen anymore.
Architec@@ ts can hear you, and you're not intimid@@ ated by architecture.
That means that that pen@@ dul@@ um sw@@ inging back and forth from style to sty@@ le, from movement to movement, is irre@@ levant@@ .
We can actually move forward and find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces.
This is the end of architectural history, and it means that the buildings of tomorrow are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today.
It means that a public space in the ancient city of Sev@@ il@@ le can be unique and tail@@ or@@ ed to the way that a modern city works.
It means that a stadi@@ um in Brooklyn can be a stadi@@ um in Brooklyn, not some red@@ -@@ br@@ ick historical pas@@ ti@@ che of what we think a stadi@@ um ought to be.
It means that robots are going to build our buildings, because we're finally ready for the forms that they're going to produce.
And it means that buildings will tw@@ ist to the wh@@ im@@ s of nature instead of the other way around.
It means that a parking garage in Mi@@ ami Beach, Flor@@ ida, can also be a place for sports and for yog@@ a and you can even get married there late at night.
It means that three architects can dream about swimming in the East River of New York, and then raise nearly half a million dollars from a community that gathered around their cause, no one client anymore.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little re@@ inde@@ er pav@@ il@@ ion that's as mus@@ c@@ ly and sin@@ ew@@ y as the animals it's designed to obser@@ ve.
And it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful to be lo@@ v@@ able, like this ugly little building in S@@ pain, where the architects du@@ g a ho@@ le, packed it with h@@ ay, and then poured concrete around it, and when the concrete dri@@ ed, they invited someone to come and clean that h@@ ay out so that all that's left when it's done is this h@@ ide@@ ous little room that's filled with the im@@ prints and scrat@@ ches of how that place was made.
And that becomes the most sub@@ li@@ me place to watch a Spanish sun@@ set.
Because it doesn't matter if a cow builds our buildings or a robot builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build, it matters what we build.
Architec@@ ts already know how to make buildings that are green@@ er and smarter and friend@@ li@@ er.
We've just been waiting for all of you to want them.
And finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
F@@ ind an architect, hire an architect, work with us to design better buildings, better cities, and a better world, because the sta@@ kes are high.
Buil@@ dings don't just reflect our society, they shape our society down to the smallest spac@@ es: the local libr@@ aries, the homes where we raise our children, and the walk that they take from the bedro@@ om to the bathro@@ om.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: About 10,000 people a month Google the phras@@ e, “@@ Am I u@@ gl@@ y@@ ?” Me@@ agh@@ an Ram@@ se@@ y of the Do@@ ve Sel@@ f@@ -@@ Es@@ te@@ em Project has a feeling that many of them are young girls. In a deeply un@@ sett@@ ling talk, she walks us through the surprising impacts of low body and image confid@@ ence@@ —@@ from lower grade point aver@@ ages to greater ris@@ k-@@ taking with drugs and alcohol@@ . And then shares the key things all of us can do to disrup@@ t this reality.
Me@@ agh@@ an Ram@@ se@@ y: Why thinking you're ugly is bad for you.
This is my ni@@ ec@@ e, S@@ tell@@ a.
She's just turned one and started to walk.
And she's walking in that really cool way that one-@@ year-olds do, a kind of tee@@ ter@@ ing, my@@ -@@ bod@@ y@@ '@@ s-@@ mov@@ ing@@ - to@@ o-@@ fast-@@ for-@@ my@@ -@@ legs kind of way.
It is absolutely gorge@@ ous.
And one of her favorite things to do at the moment is to stare at herself in the mirr@@ or.
She absolutely loves her reflec@@ tion.
She gig@@ g@@ les and sque@@ als, and gives herself these big, we@@ t kis@@ ses.
It is beautiful.
Ap@@ par@@ ently, all of her friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this, and it got me think@@ ing: When did I stop doing this?
When is it suddenly not okay to love the way that we loo@@ k?
Because apparently we don't.
Ten thousand people every month go@@ og@@ le, "A@@ m I u@@ gl@@ y?"
This is F@@ ay@@ e. F@@ ay@@ e is 13 and she lives in Den@@ ver.
And like any teenag@@ er, she just wants to be liked and to fit in.
It's Sunday night.
She's getting ready for the week ahead at school.
And she's slightly dre@@ ading it, and she's a bit confused because despite her mom telling her all the time that she's beautiful, every day at school, someone tells her that she's u@@ gl@@ y.
Because of the difference between what her mom tells her and what her friends at school, or her pe@@ ers at school are telling her, she doesn't know who to believe.
So, she takes a video of her@@ self. She pos@@ ts it to YouTube and she asks people to please leave a comment@@ : "A@@ m I pretty or am I u@@ gl@@ y?"
Well, so far, F@@ ay@@ e has received over 13@@ ,000 com@@ ments.
Some of them are so nas@@ ty, they don't bear thinking about.
This is an average, health@@ y-@@ looking teenage girl receiving this feedback at one of the most emotionally vulnerable times in her life.
Th@@ ous@@ ands of people are pos@@ ting videos like this, mostly teenage girls, reaching out in this way.
But what's leading them to do this?
Well, today's teenagers are rarely alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available at all times, talking, mess@@ aging, lik@@ ing, comment@@ ing, shar@@ ing, pos@@ ting — it never ends.
Never before have we been so connected, so continu@@ ously, so instantane@@ ously, so young.
And as one mom told me, it's like there's a party in their bedro@@ om every night.
There's simply no privac@@ y.
And the social press@@ ures that go along with that are rel@@ ent@@ less.
This al@@ wa@@ ys@@ -@@ on environment is training our kids to value themselves based on the number of likes they get and the types of comments that they rece@@ ive.
There's no separation between online and of@@ fl@@ ine life.
What's real or what isn't is really hard to tell the difference between.
And it's also really hard to tell the difference between what's authentic and what's digit@@ ally manipul@@ ated.
What's a highlight in someone's life versus what's normal in the context of every@@ day.
And where are they looking to for inspir@@ ation?
Well, you can see the kinds of images that are covering the news@@ feeds of girls today.
S@@ ize zero models still domin@@ ate our cat@@ wal@@ ks.
Air@@ brus@@ hing is now rout@@ ine.
And trends like #@@ thin@@ spir@@ ation, #@@ th@@ igh@@ g@@ ap, #@@ bi@@ kin@@ i@@ bridge and #@@ pro@@ ana.
For those who don't know, #@@ pro@@ ana means pro-@@ anor@@ ex@@ ia.
These trends are te@@ amed with the stereo@@ typing and fl@@ agr@@ ant objec@@ ti@@ fication of women in today's popular culture.
It is not hard to see what girls are ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king themselves again@@ st.
But boys are not immune to this either.
As@@ pir@@ ing to the ch@@ is@@ eled ja@@ w lines and ri@@ pped six pac@@ ks of super@@ her@@ o-@@ like sports stars and play@@ boy music artist@@ s.
But, what's the problem with all of this?
Well, surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy, well bal@@ anced individuals.
But in an ima@@ ge-@@ obsessed culture, we are training our kids to spend more time and mental effort on their appear@@ ance at the expen@@ se of all of the other aspects of their identi@@ ties.
So, things like their relationships, the development of their physical abil@@ ities, and their studies and so on begin to suffer@@ .
Six out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do something because they don't think they look good enough.
These are not trivial activi@@ ties.
These are fundamental activities to their development as humans and as contribut@@ ors to society and to the work@@ force.
Thir@@ ty-@@ one percent, nearly one in three teenag@@ ers, are with@@ drawing from classroom debate. They're failing to engage in classroom debate because they don't want to draw attention to the way that they look.
One in five are not showing up to class at all on days when they don't feel good about it.
And when it comes to exam@@ s, if you don't think you look good enough, specifically if you don't think you are thin enough, you will score a lower grade point average than your pe@@ ers who are not concerned with this.
And this is consistent across Fin@@ land, the U.S.
And China, and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh@@ .
So to be super clear, we're talking about the way you think you look, not how you actually look.
Lo@@ w body confidence is under@@ mining academic achiev@@ ement.
But it's also dam@@ aging health.
Te@@ en@@ agers with low body confidence do less physical activity, eat less fru@@ its and veget@@ ables, par@@ take in more un@@ healthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disord@@ ers.
They have lower self-@@ este@@ em.
They're more easily influenced by people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's for all of these reasons that they take more risks with things like alcohol and drug use@@ ; crash diet@@ ing; cos@@ metic surger@@ y; un@@ protec@@ ted, earlier sex@@ ; and self-@@ har@@ m.
The pursuit of the perfect body is putting pressure on our healthcare systems and cost@@ ing our governments billions of dollars every year.
And we don't grow out of it.
Women who think they're over@@ weight — again, regardless of whether they are or are not — have higher rates of ab@@ sente@@ e@@ ism.
Sev@@ ente@@ en percent of women would not show up to a job interview on a day when they weren't feeling confident about the way that they look.
Have a think about what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what that opportunity looks like.
Un@@ loc@@ king this potential is in the interest of every single one of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking, on its own, only gets you so far.
It's not enough by itself.
If you actually want to make a difference, you have to do something.
And we've learned there are three key wa@@ ys: The first is we have to educate for body confid@@ ence.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome ima@@ ge-@@ related press@@ ures and build their self-@@ este@@ em.
Now, the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this.
The bad news is that most of them don't work.
I was shocked to learn that many well-@@ meaning programs are in@@ adver@@ tent@@ ly actually making the situation worse.
So we need to make damn sure that the programs that our kids are receiving are not only having a positive impac@@ t, but having a las@@ ting impact as well.
And the research shows that the best programs address six key ar@@ eas@@ : The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
The second is media and celebr@@ ity culture, then how to handle te@@ asing and bul@@ ly@@ ing, the way we compete and compare with one another based on loo@@ ks, talking about appear@@ ance — some people call this "@@ body tal@@ k" or "@@ fat tal@@ k" — and finally, the foundations of respec@@ ting and looking after yourself.
These six things are crucial starting points for anyone serious about delivering bod@@ y-@@ confidence education that works.
An education is critic@@ al, but tack@@ ling this problem is going to require each and everyone of us to step up and be better role models for the women and girls in our own lives.
Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing the status quo of how women are seen and talked about in our own cir@@ cles.
It is not okay that we judge the contribution of our politicians by their hair@@ cuts or the size of their bre@@ as@@ ts, or to inf@@ er that the determin@@ ation or the success of an Olym@@ pi@@ an is down to her not being a look@@ er.
We need to start jud@@ ging people by what they do, not what they look like.
We can all start by taking responsibility for the types of pictures and comments that we post on our own social networks.
We can compli@@ ment people based on their effort and their actions and not on their appear@@ ance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time that you kis@@ sed a mirr@@ or?
Ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ tely, we need to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses to really change this culture of ours so that our kids grow up valu@@ ing their whole selves, valu@@ ing individual@@ ity, diversity, inclus@@ ion.
We need to put the people that are making a real difference on our ped@@ est@@ als, making a difference in the real world.
G@@ iving them the air@@ time, because only then will we create a different world.
A world where our kids are free to become the best versions of themselves, where the way they think they look never holds them back from being who they are or achieving what they want in life.
Think about what this might mean for someone in your life.
Who have you got in min@@ d?
Is it your wife@@ ?
Your sis@@ ter?
Your daugh@@ ter?
Your ni@@ ec@@ e?
Your friend@@ ? It could just be the woman a couple of seats away from you today.
What would it mean for her if she were fre@@ ed from that voice of her inner cri@@ tic, n@@ ag@@ ging her to have longer legs, thin@@ ner th@@ igh@@ s, smaller stomach@@ , shorter fe@@ et@@ ?
What could it mean for her if we over@@ came this and un@@ locked her potential in that way?
Right now, our cul@@ ture@@ 's obsession with image is holding us all back.
But let's show our kids the truth.
Let's show them that the way you look is just one part of your identity and that the truth is we love them for who they are and what they do and how they make us feel.
Let's build self-@@ este@@ em into our school curricul@@ um@@ s.
Let's each and every one of us change the way we talk and compare ourselves to other people.
And let's work together as communities, from grassroots to governments, so that the happy little one-@@ year-olds of today become the confident chan@@ ge@@ makers of tomorrow.
Let's do this.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: If you’re raised on dog@@ ma and h@@ ate, can you choose a different path@@ ? Z@@ ak E@@ br@@ a@@ him was just seven years old when his father helped plan the 199@@ 3 World Trade Center bomb@@ ing. His story is shock@@ ing, powerful and, ultimately, inspir@@ ing.
Z@@ ak E@@ br@@ ah@@ im@@ : I am the son of a terror@@ ist. Here's how I chose peace.
On November 5@@ th, 1990, a man named El@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassin@@ ated Rab@@ bi Me@@ ir Kah@@ ane, the leader of the Jewish Def@@ ense Le@@ agu@@ e.
N@@ os@@ air was initially found not guilty of the mur@@ der, but while serving time on less@@ er charg@@ es, he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City land@@ mark@@ s, including tunnel@@ s, syn@@ ag@@ o@@ gues and the United Nations head@@ quar@@ ters.
Thank@@ fully, those plans were fo@@ iled by an FBI inform@@ ant.
Sad@@ ly, the 199@@ 3 bomb@@ ing of the World Trade Center was not.
N@@ os@@ air would eventually be convicted for his invol@@ v@@ ement in the plo@@ t.
El@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh@@ , Pennsyl@@ van@@ ia in 198@@ 3 to him, an Egyptian engineer, and a loving American mother and grade school teacher, who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me.
It wasn't until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change.
My father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people, including the majority of Muslim@@ s, get to see.
It's been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another, it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part, we all want the same things out of life.
However, in every religion, in every population, you'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fer@@ v@@ ently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do.
A few months prior to his arr@@ est, he sat me down and explained that for the past few week@@ ends, he and some friends had been going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice.
He told me I'd be going with him the next morning.
We arrived at Cal@@ ver@@ ton Sho@@ o@@ ting R@@ ang@@ e, which un@@ be@@ kno@@ wn@@ st to our group was being watched by the FB@@ I.
When it was my turn to shoo@@ t, my father helped me hold the ri@@ f@@ le to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about 30 yar@@ ds off.
That day, the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone's surprise, especially mine, the entire target burst into flam@@ es.
My uncle turned to the other men, and in Arabic said, "I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h@@ ."
Like father, like son.
They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that com@@ ment, but it wasn't until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny.
They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of.
Those men would eventually be convicted of plac@@ ing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explos@@ ives into the sub-@@ level parking lot of the World Trade Cent@@ er's North To@@ w@@ er, causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others.
These were the men I looked up to.
These were the men I called am@@ mu@@ , which means un@@ cle.
By the time I turned 19, I had already moved 20 times in my life, and that inst@@ ability during my childhood didn't really provide an opportunity to make many friends.
Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone, it was time to pack up and move to the next town.
Being the perpe@@ tual new face in class, I was frequently the target of bul@@ lies.
I kept my identity a secret from my class@@ mates to avoid being tar@@ ge@@ ted, but as it turns out, being the qui@@ et, ch@@ ub@@ by new kid in class was more than enough am@@ mun@@ i@@ tion.
So for the most part, I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games.
For those reasons, my social skills were l@@ ack@@ ing, to say the least, and growing up in a big@@ o@@ ted house@@ hold, I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I'd been raised to judge people based on arbitr@@ ary measure@@ ments, like a person's race or religion.
So what opened my ey@@ es?
One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elec@@ tions.
Through a college pre@@ p program, in the National You@@ th Con@@ v@@ ention in Philadelph@@ ia.
My particular group@@ 's focus was on youth violence, and having been the victim of bul@@ lying for most of my life, this was a subject in which I felt particularly passion@@ ate.
The members of our group came from many different walks of life.
One day toward the end of the conven@@ tion, I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ ended was Je@@ wish.
Now, it had taken several days for this detail to come to light, and I realized that there was no natural anim@@ os@@ ity between the two of us.
I had never had a Jewish friend before, and frank@@ ly I felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insur@@ moun@@ table.
Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Bus@@ ch Gar@@ den@@ s, an am@@ use@@ ment park.
Ther@@ e, I was exposed to people from all sorts of fai@@ ths and cultures, and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character.
Most of my life, I'd been taught that homos@@ ex@@ ual@@ ity was a sin@@ , and by exten@@ sion, that all gay people were a negative influ@@ ence.
As chance would have it, I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay perfor@@ mers at a show there, and soon found that many were the kin@@ dest@@ , least judg@@ mental people I had ever met.
Being bul@@ lied as a kid created a sense of empathy in me toward the suffering of others, and it comes very un@@ naturally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be tre@@ ated.
Because of that feeling, I was able to contrast the stereo@@ types I'd been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction.
I don't know what it's like to be gay, but I'm well ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ ted with being jud@@ ged for something that's beyond my control.
Then there was "The D@@ aily Sho@@ w."
On a nigh@@ tly basis, Jon Stewart forced me to be intellectu@@ ally honest with myself about my own big@@ o@@ try and helped me to realize that a person's race, religion or sexual orient@@ ation had nothing to do with the quality of one's character.
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in desperate need of one.
In@@ spir@@ ation can often come from an unexpected place, and the fact that a Jewish comedi@@ an had done more to posi@@ tively influence my world@@ view than my own extremis@@ t father is not lost on me.
One day, I had a conversation with my mother about how my world@@ view was starting to change, and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live.
She looked at me with the we@@ ary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dog@@ ma@@ tis@@ m to last a lifetime, and said, "I'm tired of h@@ ating people@@ ."
In that inst@@ ant, I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hat@@ red inside of you.
Z@@ ak E@@ br@@ a@@ him is not my real name.
I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life.
So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in dang@@ er?
Well, that's simple.
I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is comp@@ elled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way, that although I had been subjec@@ ted to this viol@@ ent, intoler@@ ant ide@@ ology, that I did not become fan@@ ati@@ ci@@ z@@ ed.
Instead, I choose to use my experience to fight back against terror@@ ism, against the big@@ o@@ try.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives.
For the victims of terror@@ ism, I will speak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess acts and con@@ dem@@ n my father's actions.
And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race, and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father.
I am not my father.
Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you all. Thanks a lot.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Our consciousness is a fundamental aspect of our existence, says philosopher David Ch@@ al@@ mer@@ s: “@@ There@@ ’s nothing we know about more direc@@ t@@ ly@@ …@@ . but at the same time it’s the most mysterious phenomenon in the univer@@ se@@ .” He shares some ways to think about the movie playing in our heads.
David Ch@@ al@@ mer@@ s: How do you explain conscious@@ ness@@ ?
Right now you have a movie playing inside your head.
It's an amazing multi-@@ track movie.
It has 3D vision and surround sound for what you're seeing and hearing right now, but that's just the start of it.
Your movie has smell and taste and touch.
It has a sense of your body, pain, hun@@ ger, orgas@@ ms.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memor@@ ies, like scenes from your childhood playing before you.
And it has this constant vo@@ ice@@ over narrative in your stream of conscious thinking.
At the heart of this movie is you experiencing all this direc@@ tly.
This movie is your stream of consciousness, the subject of experience of the mind and the world.
Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence.
Each of us is consci@@ ous.
We all have our own inner movie, you and you and you.
There's nothing we know about more direc@@ tly.
At least, I know about my consciousness direc@@ tly.
I can't be certain that you guys are consci@@ ous.
Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness also is what makes life worth living.
If we weren't consci@@ ous, nothing in our lives would have meaning or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious@@ ?
Why do we have these inner movi@@ es?
Why aren't we just robots who process all this input@@ , produce all that output@@ , without experiencing the inner movie at all?
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science, some radical ideas may be needed.
Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible.
Sci@@ ence, by its nature, is objec@@ tive.
Con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness, by its nature, is subjec@@ tive.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
For much of the 20th century, that view held s@@ way.
Psy@@ ch@@ ologists studied behavior objec@@ tively, neuros@@ cientists studied the brain objec@@ tively, and nobody even mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED got started, there was very little scientific work on consciousness.
Now, about 20 years ago, all that began to change.
Neur@@ os@@ cientists like Francis C@@ ric@@ k and physicists like Roger Pen@@ rose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness.
And since then, there's been a real explos@@ ion, a flow@@ ering of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.
But it also has some fundamental limitations so far.
The cent@@ er@@ piece of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the search for cor@@ relation@@ s, cor@@ relations between certain areas of the brain and certain states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of work from Nancy K@@ an@@ wis@@ her and the wonderful work she presented just a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain or of feeling happy.
But this is still a science of cor@@ relation@@ s.
It's not a science of explan@@ ations.
We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why they do.
I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want answered about consciousness, the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they cor@@ relate with.
But in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.
No knock on the neuros@@ cientist@@ s.
There are no truly easy problems with consciousness.
But it doesn't address the real mystery at the core of this subjec@@ t: why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all?
Why is there this inner subjective movi@@ e?
Right now, we don't really have a be@@ ad on that.
And you might say, let's just give neuroscience a few years.
It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon like traffic jam@@ s, like hurric@@ an@@ es, like life, and we'll figure it out.
The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior, how a traffic jam behav@@ es, how a hurric@@ ane func@@ tions, how a living organism re@@ produces and adap@@ ts and metabol@@ iz@@ es, all questions about objective function@@ ing.
You could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomen@@ a: how we walk, how we talk, how we play ch@@ ess, all these questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
When it comes to the hard problem, that's the question of why is it that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experi@@ ence?
And here, the standard paradigm of emer@@ gen@@ ce, even the standard paradig@@ ms of neurosci@@ ence, don't really, so far, have that much to say.
Now, I'm a scientific materi@@ alist at heart.
I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works, and for a long time, I bang@@ ed my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work.
But I eventually came to the conclusion that that just didn't work for systematic reasons.
It's a long story, but the core idea is just that what you get from purely reduc@@ tion@@ ist explan@@ ations in physical terms, in brain@@ -based terms, is stories about the functioning of a system, its structure, its dynam@@ ics, the behavior it produc@@ es, great for solving the easy problems — how we behav@@ e, how we function — but when it comes to subjective experience — why does all this feel like something from the ins@@ ide@@ ? —
That's something fundamentally new, and it's always a further question.
So I think we're at a kind of im@@ passe here.
We've got this wonderful, great chain of explan@@ ation, we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains parts of psycholog@@ y.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this picture.
On the one hand, it's a dat@@ um that we're consci@@ ous.
On the other hand, we don't know how to accommod@@ ate it into our scientific view of the world.
So I think consciousness right now is a kind of anom@@ al@@ y, one that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.
F@@ ac@@ ed with an anom@@ al@@ y like this, radical ideas may be nee@@ ded, and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to gri@@ ps with consciousness scientific@@ ally.
Now, there are a few candid@@ ates for what those crazy ideas might be.
My friend Dan Den@@ net@@ t, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or confus@@ ion.
Actually, all we've got to do is explain the objective func@@ tions, the behaviors of the brain, and then we've explained everything that needs to be explain@@ ed.
Well I say, more power to him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a purely reduc@@ tion@@ ist brain@@ -based theory of consciousness.
At the same time, for me and for many other people, that view is a bit too close to simply den@@ ying the dat@@ um of consciousness to be satis@@ factor@@ y.
So I go in a different direction.
In the time remain@@ ing, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promis@@ e.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
Phys@@ ic@@ ists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building block@@ s: space and time and mass.
They pos@@ tul@@ ate fundamental laws gover@@ ning them, like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechan@@ ics.
These fundamental properties and laws aren't explained in terms of anything more basic@@ .
Ra@@ ther, they're taken as primi@@ tive, and you build up the world from there.
Now sometimes, the list of fundament@@ als expand@@ s.
In the 19th century, M@@ ax@@ well figured out that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundament@@ als — space, time, mas@@ s, New@@ ton@@ 's laws — so he pos@@ tul@@ ated fundamental laws of electro@@ magne@@ tis@@ m and pos@@ tul@@ ated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern@@ .
I think that's the situation we're in with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundament@@ als — space, time, mas@@ s, charge — then as a matter of log@@ ic, you need to expand the list.
The natural thing to do is to pos@@ tul@@ ate consciousness itself as something fundamental, a fundamental building block of nature.
This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it.
This opens up the way for you to do science with it.
What we then need is to study the fundamental laws gover@@ ning consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness to other fundament@@ al@@ s: space, time, mas@@ s, physical processes.
Phys@@ ic@@ ists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t-@@ shir@@ t.
Well I think something like that is the situation we're in with consciousness.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t-@@ shir@@ t.
We don't know what those laws are yet, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal.
Every system might have some degree of consciousness.
This view is sometimes called pan@@ psych@@ ism@@ : p@@ an for all, psy@@ ch for mind, every system is consci@@ ous, not just humans, do@@ gs, mic@@ e, flies, but even Rob K@@ nigh@@ t's microb@@ es, elementary particles.
Even a pho@@ ton has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that pho@@ tons are intelligent or thinking.
It's not that a pho@@ ton is wr@@ ac@@ ked with ang@@ st because it's thinking, "A@@ w@@ w, I'm always bu@@ zz@@ ing around near the speed of light.
I never get to slow down and smell the ros@@ es."
No, not like that.
But the thought is maybe pho@@ tons might have some element of ra@@ w, subjective feeling, some primitive pre@@ cursor to consciousness.
This may sound a bit ko@@ ok@@ y to you.
I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental.
If it's fundamental, like space and time and mas@@ s, it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too, the way they are.
It's also worth no@@ ting that although the idea seems counter@@ intuitive to us, it's much less counter@@ intuitive to people from different cultures, where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature.
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness to physical processing is to link consciousness to information.
Wher@@ ever there's information process@@ ing, there's consciousness.
Comple@@ x information process@@ ing, like in a human, complex consciousness.
Sim@@ ple information process@@ ing, simple consciousness.
A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuros@@ cientist@@ , Gi@@ u@@ lio Ton@@ on@@ i, has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigor@@ ously with a mathematical theory.
He has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls ph@@ i, measuring the amount of information integrated in a system.
And he suppos@@ es that ph@@ i goes along with consciousness.
So in a human brain, incredibly large amount of information integr@@ ation, high degree of ph@@ i, a whole lot of consciousness.
In a mouse, medium degree of information integr@@ ation, still pretty signific@@ ant, pretty serious amount of consciousness.
But as you go down to wor@@ ms, microb@@ es, particles, the amount of ph@@ i falls off.
The amount of information integration falls off, but it's still non-@@ zero.
On Ton@@ oni@@ 's theory, there's still going to be a non-@@ zero degree of consciousness.
In effect, he's propos@@ ing a fundamental law of conscious@@ ness@@ : high ph@@ i, high consciousness.
Now, I don't know if this theory is right, but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness, and it's been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data, and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t-@@ shir@@ t.
Another final motivation is that pan@@ psych@@ ism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world.
Phys@@ ic@@ ists and philosop@@ hers have often observed that physics is curi@@ ously abstr@@ act.
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equ@@ ations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality that under@@ lies it.
As Stephen Hawking puts it, what puts the fire into the equ@@ ations?
Well, on the pan@@ psych@@ ist view, you can leave the equ@@ ations of physics as they are, but you can take them to be describing the flu@@ x of consciousness.
That's what physics really is ultimately doing, describing the flu@@ x of consciousness.
On this view, it's consciousness that puts the fire into the equ@@ ations.
On that view, consciousness doesn't dang@@ le outside the physical world as some kind of extr@@ a.
It's there right at its heart.
This view, I think, the pan@@ psych@@ ist view, has the potential to trans@@ figure our relationship to nature, and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical consequences.
Some of these may be counter@@ intuiti@@ ve.
I used to think I shouldn't eat anything which is consci@@ ous, so therefore I should be vegetari@@ an.
Now, if you're a pan@@ psych@@ ist and you take that view, you're going to go very hungr@@ y.
So I think when you think about it, this tends to trans@@ figure your view@@ s, whereas what matters for ethical purpos@@ es and moral consider@@ ations, not so much the fact of consciousness, but the degree and the complexity of consciousness.
It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artifici@@ ally intelligent system in the movie "H@@ er@@ ," Sam@@ anth@@ a?
Is she conscious@@ ?
Well, if you take the informa@@ tion@@ al, pan@@ psych@@ ist view, she certainly has complicated information processing and integr@@ ation, so the answer is very likely yes, she is consci@@ ous.
If that's right, it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the eth@@ ics of developing intelligent computer systems and the eth@@ ics of turning them off.
Finally, you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups, the planet.
Does Canada have its own conscious@@ ness@@ ?
Or at a more local level, does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference, are we right now having a collective TED consciousness, an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our part@@ s?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it's at least one worth taking seriously.
Okay, so this pan@@ psych@@ ist vision, it is a radical one, and I don't know that it's correc@@ t.
I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental, than about the second one, that it's universal.
I mean, the view raises any number of questions, has any number of challenges, like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness.
If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosoph@@ y.
We can't expect to solve it over@@ night.
But I do think we're going to figure it out eventu@@ ally.
Under@@ standing consciousness is a real key, I think, both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves.
It may just take the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: S@@ tel@@ la Young is a comedi@@ an and journalist who happens to go about her day in a wheelchair — a fact that does@@ n't, she'd like to make clear, automatically turn her into a no@@ ble inspiration to all humanity. In this very funny talk, Young breaks down societ@@ y's habit of turning disab@@ led people into "@@ inspiration por@@ n@@ ."
S@@ tel@@ la Youn@@ g: I'm not your inspir@@ ation, thank you very much.
I grew up in a very small country town in Victor@@ ia.
I had a very normal, low-@@ key kind of up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing.
I went to school, I hun@@ g out with my friends, I fought with my younger sis@@ ters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my local community approached my parents and wanted to nomin@@ ate me for a community achiev@@ ement awar@@ d.
And my parents said, "H@@ m, that's really nice, but there's kind of one g@@ lar@@ ing problem with that.
She hasn't actually achieved any@@ thing." And they were right, you know.
I went to school, I got good mark@@ s, I had a very low-@@ key after school job in my m@@ um@@ 's hair@@ dr@@ essing sal@@ on, and I spent a lot of time watching "@@ Bu@@ f@@ fy the V@@ am@@ pire S@@ lay@@ er@@ " and "D@@ aw@@ son's Cre@@ e@@ k."
Yeah, I know. What a contradic@@ tion.
But they were right, you know.
I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all.
I wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achiev@@ ement if you took disability out of the equ@@ ation.
Y@@ ears later, I was on my second teaching round in a Mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne high school, and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class when this boy put up his hand and said, "H@@ ey mis@@ s, when are you going to start doing your spee@@ ch@@ ?"
And I said, "What spee@@ ch@@ ?"
You know, I'd been talking them about de@@ fam@@ ation law for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, like, your motiv@@ ational speak@@ ing.
You know, when people in wheel@@ chairs come to school, they usually say, like, inspir@@ ational stuff@@ ?"
"It's usually in the big hall@@ ."
And that's when it da@@ wn@@ ed on me: This kid had only ever experienced disab@@ led people as objects of inspir@@ ation.
We are not, to this kid - and it's not his faul@@ t, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For lots of us, disab@@ led people are not our teachers or our doctors or our man@@ ic@@ ur@@ ists.
We're not real people. We are there to inspi@@ re.
And in fact, I am sitting on this stage looking like I do in this wheel@@ chair, and you are probably kind of expecting me to inspire you. Right? Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid I'm going to disap@@ point you dramatic@@ ally.
I am not here to inspire you.
I am here to tell you that we have been lied to about dis@@ ability.
Yeah, we've been sold the lie that disability is a B@@ ad Th@@ ing, capital B, capital T.
It's a bad thing, and to live with a disability makes you excep@@ tion@@ al.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you excep@@ tion@@ al.
And in the past few years, we've been able to propag@@ ate this lie even further via social media.
You may have seen images like this one: "The only disability in life is a bad attitu@@ de@@ ."
Or this one: "@@ Your excuse is inv@@ al@@ id@@ ." Inde@@ ed.
Or this one: "@@ Before you qu@@ it, tr@@ y@@ !"
These are just a couple of examples, but there are a lot of these images out there.
You know, you might have seen the one, the little girl with no hands drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.
You might have seen a child running on carbon fiber prosthetic legs.
And these images, there are lots of them out there, they are what we call inspiration por@@ n.
And I use the term por@@ n deliber@@ ately, because they objec@@ ti@@ fy one group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we're objec@@ ti@@ fying disab@@ led people for the benefit of non@@ disab@@ led people.
The purpose of these images is to inspire you, to motivate you, so that we can look at them and think, "Well, however bad my life is, it could be worse.
I could be that person@@ ."
But what if you are that person@@ ?
I've lost count of the number of times that I've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave or inspir@@ ation@@ al, and this was long before my work had any kind of public profi@@ le.
They were just kind of congr@@ atul@@ ating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember my own name. And it is objec@@ ti@@ f@@ ying.
These images, those images objec@@ ti@@ fy disab@@ led people for the benefit of non@@ disab@@ led people.
They are there so that you can look at them and think that things aren't so bad for you, to put your wor@@ ries into perspective.
And life as a disab@@ led person is actually somewhat difficult.
We do overcome some things.
But the things that we're over@@ coming are not the things that you think they are.
They are not things to do with our bodies.
I use the term "@@ disab@@ led people@@ " quite deliber@@ ately, because I sub@@ scri@@ be to what's called the social model of dis@@ ability, which tells us that we are more disab@@ led by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagnos@@ es.
So I have lived in this body a long time.
I'm quite fon@@ d of it.
It does the things that I need it to do, and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have, and that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the ordin@@ ary.
They are just using their bodies to the best of their capacity.
So is it really fair to objec@@ ti@@ fy them in the way that we do, to share those imag@@ es?
Peop@@ le, when they say, "You're an inspir@@ ation@@ ," they mean it as a compli@@ ment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold this lie that disability makes you excep@@ tion@@ al.
And it honest@@ ly does@@ n't.
And I know what you're thinking.
You know, I'm up here bag@@ ging out inspir@@ ation, and you're thinking, "@@ Je@@ e@@ z, S@@ tell@@ a, aren't you inspired sometimes by some thing@@ s?"
And the thing is, I am.
I learn from other disab@@ led people all the time.
I'm learning not that I am luck@@ ier than them, though.
I am learning that it's a genius idea to use a pair of barbe@@ cu@@ e t@@ ong@@ s to pick up things that you drop@@ ped. I'm learning that ni@@ f@@ ty trick where you can charge your mobile phone battery from your chair batter@@ y.
Gen@@ i@@ us.
We are learning from each other@@ s' strength and endur@@ ance, not against our bodies and our diagnos@@ es, but against a world that excep@@ tion@@ aliz@@ es and objec@@ ti@@ fies us.
I really think that this lie that we've been sold about disability is the greatest in@@ justice.
It makes life hard for us.
And that quote, "The only disability in life is a bad attitu@@ de@@ ," the reason that that's bull@@ sh@@ it is because it's just not true, because of the social model of dis@@ ability.
No amount of smil@@ ing at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ram@@ p.
N@@ ever. S@@ mil@@ ing at a television screen isn't going to make closed cap@@ tions appear for people who are deaf@@ .
No amount of standing in the middle of a book@@ shop and radi@@ ating a positive attitude is going to turn all those books into br@@ ail@@ le.
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the excep@@ tion, but the nor@@ m.
I want to live in a world where a 15@@ -year-old girl sitting in her bedro@@ om watching "@@ Bu@@ f@@ fy the V@@ am@@ pire S@@ lay@@ er@@ " isn't referred to as achieving anything because she's doing it sitting down.
I want to live in a world where we don't have such low expectations of disab@@ led people that we are congr@@ atul@@ ated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achiev@@ ement for disab@@ led people, and I want to live in a world where a kid in year 11 in a Mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair us@@ er.
Dis@@ ability doesn't make you excep@@ tion@@ al, but questioning what you think you know about it does.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Chris K@@ lu@@ we wants to look into the future of sports and think about how technology will help not just players and co@@ ach@@ es, but f@@ ans. Here the former N@@ F@@ L pun@@ ter en@@ visions a future in which aug@@ mented reality will help people experience sports as if they are directly on the field - and maybe even help them see others in a new light, too.
Chris K@@ lu@@ we@@ : How aug@@ mented reality will change sports ... and build empathy.
What do aug@@ mented reality and professional football have to do with empath@@ y?
And what is the air speed veloc@@ ity of an un@@ lad@@ en swal@@ low@@ ?
Now unfortunately, I'm only going to answer one of those questions today, so please, try and contain your disap@@ point@@ ment.
When most people think about aug@@ mented reality, they think about "M@@ in@@ or@@ ity Re@@ port@@ " and Tom Cru@@ ise wav@@ ing his hands in the air, but aug@@ mented reality is not science fic@@ tion.
Aug@@ mented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime, and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen, and people need to be aware of that, because aug@@ mented reality will change our lives just as much as the Internet and the cell phone.
Now how do we get to aug@@ mented real@@ ity?
Ste@@ p one is the step I'm wearing right now, Google Glas@@ s.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glas@@ s.
What you may not be familiar with is that Google Gl@@ ass is a device that will allow you to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional athle@@ te on the field.
Right now, the only way you can be on the field is for me to try and describe it to you.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you then fill in with your imagination.
With Google Glas@@ s, we can put that underneath a hel@@ met, and we can get a sense of what it's like to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour, your blood p@@ ounding in your ears.
You can get a sense of what it's like to have a 2@@ 50-@@ pound man s@@ printing at you trying to de@@ capit@@ ate you with every ounce of his being.
And I've been on the receiving end of that, and it doesn't feel very good.
Now, I have some footage to show you of what it's like to wear Google Gl@@ ass underneath the hel@@ met to give you a taste of that.
Unfortunately, it's not N@@ F@@ L practice footage because the N@@ F@@ L thinks emergent technology is what happens when a submar@@ ine sur@@ faces, but — — we do what we can.
So let's pull up some video.
Chris K@@ lu@@ we@@ : G@@ o.
U@@ gh@@ , getting tack@@ led suc@@ ks.
H@@ old on, let's get a little clos@@ er.
All right, ready?
Go@@ !
Chris K@@ lu@@ we@@ : So as you can see, small taste of what it's like to get tack@@ led on the football field from the perspective of the tack@@ le@@ e.
Now, you may have noticed there are some people missing ther@@ e: the rest of the team.
We have some video of that cour@@ tes@@ y of the University of Washington.
Quar@@ ter@@ back@@ : Hey, M@@ ice 5@@ 4@@ ! M@@ ice 5@@ 4@@ !
Blue 8@@ ! Blue 8@@ ! Go@@ !
O@@ h!
C@@ K: So again, this takes you a little bit closer to what it's like to be on that field, but this is nowhere what it's like to be on the N@@ F@@ L@@ .
F@@ ans want that experience.
F@@ ans want to be on that field.
They want to be their favorite play@@ ers, and they've already talked to me on YouTube, they've talked to me on Twitter, saying, "Hey, can you get this on a quar@@ ter@@ back@@ ?
Can you get this on a running back@@ ?
We want that experi@@ ence."
Well, once we have that experience with Go@@ Pr@@ o and Google Glas@@ s, how do we make it more immer@@ si@@ ve?
How do we take that next ste@@ p@@ ?
Well, we take that step by going to something called the O@@ cul@@ us Rif@@ t, which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with.
The O@@ cul@@ us Rif@@ t has been described as one of the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created, and that is not empty hy@@ pe.
I'm going to show you why that is not empty hy@@ pe with this video.
Man: O@@ h! O@@ h!
No@@ ! No@@ ! No@@ ! I don't want to play any@@ mor@@ e! No@@ !
Oh my God@@ ! A@@ aa@@ ah@@ !
C@@ K: So that is the experience of a man on a rol@@ ler coas@@ ter in fear of his life.
What do you think that fan@@ 's experience is going to be when we take the video footage of an Adri@@ an Pe@@ ter@@ son burst@@ ing through the line, sh@@ ed@@ ding a tack@@ ler with a sti@@ ff@@ -@@ arm before s@@ printing in for a touch@@ down@@ ?
What do you think that fan@@ 's experience is going to be when he's M@@ ess@@ i s@@ printing down the pitch putting the ball in the back of the net, or Fed@@ er@@ er serving in W@@ im@@ ble@@ don@@ ?
What do you think his experience is going to be when he is going down the side of a mountain at over 70 miles an hour as an Olympic down@@ hill ski@@ er?
I think adult di@@ aper sales may surg@@ e. But this is not yet aug@@ mented reality.
This is only virtual reality, V@@ .@@ R.
How do we get to aug@@ mented reality, A.@@ R@@ .@@ ?
We get to aug@@ mented reality when co@@ aches and managers and owners look at this information stre@@ aming in that people want to see, and they say, "How do we use this to make our teams better?
How do we use this to win gam@@ es?"
Because teams always use technology to win games.
They like win@@ ning. It makes them money.
So a brief history of technology in the N@@ F@@ L@@ .
In 196@@ 5, the Balti@@ more Col@@ ts put a wr@@ ist@@ band on their quar@@ ter@@ back to allow him to call plays quick@@ er.
They ended up winning a Super Bow@@ l that year.
Other teams followed suit.
More people watched the game because it was more exciting.
It was faster.
In 1994, the N@@ F@@ L put hel@@ met radi@@ os into the hel@@ me@@ ts of the quar@@ ter@@ back@@ s, and later the defen@@ se.
More people watched games because it was faster.
It was more entertain@@ ing.
In 20@@ 2@@ 3, imagine you're a player walking back to the h@@ ud@@ d@@ le, and you have your next play dis@@ played right in front of your face on your clear plastic vis@@ or that you already wear right now.
No more having to worry about for@@ getting play@@ s.
No more worrying about having to memor@@ ize your play@@ book.
You just go out and reac@@ t.
And co@@ aches really want this, because missed assign@@ ments lose you games, and co@@ aches hate losing games.
L@@ os@@ ing games gets you fired as a co@@ ach.
They don't want that.
But aug@@ mented reality is not just an enh@@ anced play@@ book.
Aug@@ mented reality is also a way to take all that data and use it in real time to enhance how you play the game.
What would that be like?
Well, a very simple se@@ tu@@ p would be a camera on each corner of the stadi@@ um looking down, giving you a bir@@ d'@@ s-@@ eye view of all the people down there.
You also have information from hel@@ met sensors and acceler@@ ome@@ ters, technology that's being worked on right now.
You take all that information, and you stream it to your play@@ ers.
The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use.
The bad ones have information over@@ lo@@ ad.
That determines good teams from bad.
And now, your I.@@ T. department is just as important as your sco@@ ut@@ ing depart@@ ment, and dat@@ a-@@ mining is not for ner@@ ds anymore.
It's also for j@@ oc@@ ks. Who k@@ new@@ ?
What would that look like on the fiel@@ d?
Well, imagine you're the quar@@ ter@@ back.
You take the sn@@ ap and you drop back.
You're scanning down@@ field for an open recei@@ ver.
All of a sudden, a bright flash on the left side of your vis@@ or lets you know, blind side lin@@ e@@ back@@ er is b@@ lit@@ zing in.
Norm@@ ally, you wouldn't be able to see him, but the aug@@ mented reality system lets you know.
You step up into the pocket.
Another flash aler@@ ts you to an open recei@@ ver.
You throw the ball, but you're hit right as you thro@@ w.
The ball comes off track.
You don't know where it's going to land.
However, on the recei@@ ver@@ 's vis@@ or, he sees a pat@@ ch of grass light up, and he knows to read@@ jus@@ t.
He goes, cat@@ ches the ball, s@@ prints in, touch@@ down.
Cro@@ w@@ d goes wil@@ d, and the f@@ ans are with him every step of the way, watching from every perspective.
Now this is something that will create massive excitement in the game.
It will make tons of people wat@@ ch, because people want this experience.
F@@ ans want to be on the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
Aug@@ mented reality will be a part of sport@@ s, because it's too prof@@ itable not to.
But the question I ask you is, is that's all that we're content to use aug@@ mented reality for?
Are we going to use it sol@@ ely for our pan@@ em, our cir@@ cen@@ ses, our entertainment as normal@@ ?
Because I believe that we can use aug@@ mented reality for something more.
I believe we can use aug@@ mented reality as a way to foster more empathy within the human species itself, by literally showing someone what it looks like to walk a mile in another person's shoes.
We know what this technology is worth to sports le@@ agu@@ es.
It's worth revenu@@ e, to the tune of billions of dollars a year.
But what is this technology worth to a teacher in a classroom trying to show a bul@@ ly just how harmful his actions are from the perspective of the victim@@ ?
What is this technology worth to a gay Ug@@ and@@ an or Russian trying to show the world what it's like living under per@@ se@@ cu@@ tion?
What is this technology worth to a Com@@ mand@@ er Had@@ field or a Neil de@@ Gr@@ asse Ty@@ son trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quar@@ ter@@ ly reports and K@@ ard@@ as@@ hi@@ ans?
Ladies and gentlemen, aug@@ mented reality is coming.
The questions we ask, the choices we make, and the challenges we face are, as always, up to us.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For many years Serge@@ ant Kevin Brig@@ gs had a dark, un@@ usual, at times strang@@ ely rewar@@ ding job@@ : He patr@@ ol@@ led the southern end of San Francis@@ co@@ ’s Golden G@@ ate Br@@ id@@ ge, a popular site for suicide at@@ tempt@@ s. In a sober@@ ing, deeply personal talk Brig@@ gs shares stories from those he@@ ’s spoken — and listened — to standing on the edge of life. He gives a powerful piece of advice to those with loved ones who might be contempl@@ ating suic@@ ide.
Kevin Brig@@ g@@ s: The bridge between suicide and life.
I recently reti@@ red from the California High@@ way Patr@@ ol after 23 years of service.
The majority of those 23 years was spent patr@@ ol@@ ling the southern end of Mar@@ in County, which includes the Golden G@@ ate Br@@ id@@ ge.
The bridge is an iconic structure, known worldwide for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Oce@@ an, and its inspiring architecture.
Unfortunately, it is also a magne@@ t for suic@@ ide, being one of the most utiliz@@ ed sites in the world.
The Golden G@@ ate Br@@ idge opened in 193@@ 7.
Joseph S@@ tra@@ us@@ s, chief engineer in charge of building the bridge, was quo@@ ted as saying, "The bridge is practically suic@@ ide@@ -@@ pro@@ of.
Su@@ icide from the bridge is neither practical nor prob@@ ab@@ le."
But since its open@@ ing, over 1,@@ 600 people have leap@@ t to their death from that brid@@ ge.
Some believe that traveling between the two tow@@ ers will lead you to another dimension - this bridge has been roman@@ tici@@ zed as such — that the fall from that fre@@ es you from all your wor@@ ries and gri@@ ef@@ , and the waters below will clean@@ se your soul.
But let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suic@@ ide.
After a free fall of four to five seconds, the body strikes the water at about 75 miles an hour.
That impact shat@@ ters bon@@ es, some of which then punc@@ ture vital organs.
Most die on impact.
Those that don't generally fla@@ il in the water helpl@@ ess@@ ly, and then dro@@ wn.
I don't think that those who contempl@@ ate this method of suicide realize how gr@@ is@@ ly a death that they will face.
This is the cor@@ d.
Except for around the two tow@@ ers, there is 32 inches of steel parall@@ eling the brid@@ ge.
This is where most folks stand before taking their lives.
I can tell you from experience that once the person is on that cor@@ d, and at their dark@@ est time, it is very difficult to bring them back.
I took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contempl@@ ating her life.
I want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day in getting her back over the ra@@ il.
When I first began working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
You strugg@@ led to fun@@ nel your way through these call@@ s.
This was not only a dis@@ service to those contempl@@ ating suic@@ ide, but to the offic@@ ers as well.
We've come a long, long way since then.
Now, veter@@ an offic@@ ers and psychologists train new offic@@ ers.
This is Jason Gar@@ ber.
I met Jason on July 22 of last year when I get received a call of a possible suic@@ idal subject sitting on the cord near mid@@ sp@@ an.
I respon@@ ded, and when I arrived, I observed Jason speaking to a Golden G@@ ate Br@@ idge offic@@ er.
Jason was just 32 years old and had flo@@ wn out here from New Jerse@@ y.
As a matter of fact, he had flo@@ wn out here on two other occas@@ ions from New Jerse@@ y to attempt suicide on this brid@@ ge.
After about an hour of speaking with Jas@@ on, he asked us if we knew the story of P@@ and@@ or@@ a's box.
Rec@@ alling your Greek myth@@ ology, Ze@@ us created P@@ and@@ ora, and sent her down to Earth with a box, and told her, "N@@ ever, ever open that box@@ ."
Well one day, curiosity got the better of P@@ and@@ ora, and she did open the box.
Out flew pl@@ agu@@ es, sor@@ ro@@ ws, and all sorts of ev@@ ils against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
Jason then asked us, "What happens when you open the box and hope isn't there@@ ?"
He pa@@ used a few moments, lean@@ ed to his right, and was gone.
This kind, intelligent young man from New Jerse@@ y had just committed suic@@ ide.
I spoke with Jas@@ on's parents that evening, and I suppose that, when I was speaking with them, that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well, because that very next day, their family rab@@ bi called to check on me.
Jas@@ on's parents had asked him to do so.
The col@@ lateral damage of suicide affects so many people.
I pose these questions to you: What would you do if your family member, friend or loved one was suic@@ id@@ al?
What would you say?
Would you know what to say?
In my experience, it's not just the talking that you do, but the listening.
Lis@@ ten to understand.
Don't argue, bl@@ ame, or tell the person you know how they feel, because you probably don't.
By just being there, you may just be the turning point that they need.
If you think someone is suic@@ id@@ al, don't be afraid to confront them and ask the question.
One way of asking them the question is like this: "O@@ thers in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life@@ ; have you had these though@@ t@@ s?"
Con@@ fron@@ ting the person head-@@ on may just save their life and be the turning point for them.
Some other signs to look for@@ : hopel@@ ess@@ ness, believing that things are terrible and never going to get bet@@ ter@@ ; helpl@@ ess@@ ness, believing that there is nothing that you can do about it; recent social with@@ dra@@ wal@@ ; and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I received an email from a lady that I'd like to read you her let@@ ter.
She lost her son on January 19 of this year, and she wrote this me this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with her permission and bl@@ essing that I read this to you.
"H@@ i, Kev@@ in. I imagine you're at the TED Confer@@ ence.
That must be quite the experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go walk the bridge this week@@ end.
Just wanted to drop you a note.
H@@ ope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still pretty num@@ b, but notic@@ ing more moments of really realizing Mike isn't coming home.
Mike was driving from P@@ et@@ al@@ uma to San Francisco to watch the 4@@ 9@@ ers game with his father on January 19.
He never made it there.
I called P@@ et@@ al@@ uma police and reported him missing that even@@ ing.
The next morning, two offic@@ ers came to my home and reported that Mik@@ e's car was down at the brid@@ ge.
A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at 1@@ :@@ 58 p.@@ m. the previous day.
Thanks so much for standing up for those who may be only tempor@@ arily too weak to stand for themselves.
Who hasn't been low before without suffering from a true mental ill@@ ness@@ ?
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My pray@@ ers are with you for your figh@@ t.
The G@@ G@@ B, Golden G@@ ate Br@@ id@@ ge, is supposed to be a pass@@ age across our beautiful ba@@ y, not a grav@@ ey@@ ard.
Good luck this week. V@@ ick@@ y."
I can't imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day, and also the courage just to carry on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man I refer to as hope and cour@@ age.
On March 11 of 2005, I responded to a radio call of a possible suic@@ idal subject on the bridge side@@ walk near the north tow@@ er.
I ro@@ de my motor@@ cycle down the side@@ walk and observed this man, Kevin Ber@@ th@@ ia, standing on the side@@ walk.
When he saw me, he immediately tr@@ aver@@ sed that pedestri@@ an ra@@ il, and stood on that small pipe which goes around the tow@@ er.
For the next hour and a half, I listened as Kevin spoke about his depression and hopel@@ ess@@ ness.
Kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that ra@@ il and give life another chance.
When Kevin came back over, I congr@@ atul@@ ated him.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chan@@ ce@@ ?"
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You listen@@ ed.
You let me speak, and you just listen@@ ed."
S@@ hor@@ tly after this incid@@ ent, I received a letter from Kev@@ in's mother, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to read it to you.
"De@@ ar Mr. Brig@@ gs, Nothing will er@@ ase the events of March 11, but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.
I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.
He has been diagnosed with a mental illness for which he has been properly medic@@ ated.
I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old, completely un@@ aware of any her@@ edit@@ ary tra@@ its, but, thank God, now we know.
Kevin is stra@@ ight, as he say@@ s.
We truly thank God for you.
Sin@@ cer@@ ely in@@ deb@@ ted to you, N@@ ar@@ vel@@ la Ber@@ thi@@ a."
And on the bottom she writ@@ es, "P@@ .@@ S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening, you were listed as the patient.
Bo@@ y, did I have to stra@@ igh@@ ten that one out."
Today, Kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society.
He speaks open@@ ly about the events that day and his depression in the hopes that his story will inspire others.
Su@@ icide is not just something I've encountered on the job.
It's person@@ al.
My grandfather committed suicide by poison@@ ing.
That act, although ending his own pain, rob@@ bed me from ever getting to know him.
This is what suicide does.
For most suic@@ idal fol@@ ks, or those contempl@@ ating suic@@ ide, they wouldn't think of hur@@ ting another person.
They just want their own pain to end.
Ty@@ pic@@ ally, this is accomplished in just three wa@@ ys: sleep, drugs or alcohol@@ , or death.
In my career, I've responded to and been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the brid@@ ge.
Of those incid@@ ents I've been directly involved with, I've only lost two, but that's two too many.
One was Jas@@ on.
The other was a man I spoke to for about an hour.
During that time, he sho@@ ok my hand on three occasion@@ s.
On that final hand@@ shak@@ e, he looked at me, and he said, "@@ Kev@@ in, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And he leap@@ t.
Hor@@ ri@@ ble, absolutely horri@@ ble.
I do want to tell you, though, the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge do not commit suic@@ ide.
Ad@@ di@@ tion@@ ally, that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived and can talk about it, that one to two percent, most of those folks have said that the second that they let go of that ra@@ il, they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge not only connects Mar@@ in to San Francisco, but people together also.
That connection, or bridge that we make, is something that each and every one of us should str@@ ive to do.
Su@@ icide is prevent@@ able.
There is help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When fashion model Ge@@ ena Roc@@ ero first saw a photo of herself in a bi@@ kin@@ i, "I thought ... you have arri@@ ve@@ d@@ !" As she reve@@ als, that’s because she was born with the gender assignment “@@ boy@@ .” In this moving talk, Roc@@ ero tells the story of becoming who she always knew she was.
Ge@@ ena Roc@@ er@@ o: Why I must come out.
The world makes you something that you're not, but you know inside what you are, and that question bur@@ ns in your hear@@ t: How will you become that?
I may be somewhat unique in this, but I am not alone, not alone at all.
So when I became a fashion model, I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream that I'd always wanted since I was a young child.
My outside self finally matched my inner truth, my inner self.
For complicated reasons which I'll get to later, when I look at this picture, at that time I felt like, Ge@@ en@@ a, you've done it, you've made it, you have arri@@ ved.
But this past Octo@@ ber, I realized that I'm only just beginning.
All of us are put in boxes by our family, by our religion, by our society, our moment in history, even our own bodies.
Some people have the courage to break free, not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin or by the beliefs of those that surround them.
Those people are always the threat to the status qu@@ o, to what is considered accept@@ able.
In my case, for the last nine years, some of my neighbor@@ s, some of my friends, colleagues, even my ag@@ ent, did not know about my history.
I think, in myster@@ y, this is called the reve@@ al.
Here is mine.
I was assigned boy at birth based on the appear@@ ance of my gen@@ itali@@ a.
I remember when I was five years old in the Philip@@ pin@@ es walking around our house, I would always wear this t-@@ shirt on my head.
And my mom asked me, "How come you always wear that t-@@ shirt on your head@@ ?"
I said, "M@@ om, this is my hair. I'm a girl@@ ."
I knew then how to self-@@ identi@@ f@@ y.
G@@ ender has always been considered a fact, im@@ mut@@ able, but we now know it's actually more flu@@ id, complex and myster@@ i@@ ous.
Because of my success, I never had the courage to share my story, not because I thought what I am is wrong, but because of how the world tre@@ ats those of us who wish to break free.
Every day, I am so grateful because I am a woman.
I have a mom and dad and family who accepted me for who I am.
Many are not so fortun@@ ate.
There's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebr@@ ates the fluid mystery of gend@@ er.
There is a Buddhist god@@ des@@ s of compassion.
There is a Hind@@ u god@@ d@@ ess, hi@@ j@@ ra god@@ d@@ ess.
So when I was eight years old, I was at a fi@@ esta in the Philip@@ pin@@ es celebr@@ ating these myster@@ ies.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember, out comes this beautiful woman right in front of me, and I remember that moment something hit me: That is the kind of woman I would like to be.
So when I was 15 years old, still dr@@ essing as a boy, I met this woman named T.@@ L@@ .
She is a trans@@ gender beauty pag@@ e@@ ant manag@@ er.
That night she asked me, "How come you are not joining the beauty pag@@ e@@ ant@@ ?"
She convinced me that if I joined that she would take care of the registr@@ ation fe@@ e and the gar@@ ments, and that night, I won best in swim@@ suit and best in long go@@ wn and placed second run@@ ner up among 40@@ -@@ plus candid@@ ates.
That moment changed my life.
All of a sudden, I was introduced to the world of beauty pag@@ e@@ ants.
Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a pag@@ e@@ ant queen for trans@@ gender women, but I'll take it.
So from 15 to 17 years old, I joined the most presti@@ gi@@ ous pag@@ e@@ ant to the pag@@ e@@ ant where it's at the back of the truc@@ k, literally, or sometimes it would be a pav@@ ement next to a rice field, and when it rain@@ s - it rain@@ s a lot in the Philip@@ pin@@ es - the organiz@@ ers would have to move it inside someone's house.
I also experienced the good@@ ness of strang@@ ers, especially when we would travel in remote prov@@ inc@@ es in the Philip@@ pin@@ es.
But most importantly, I met some of my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that my green card peti@@ tion came through, that I could now move to the United States.
I resis@@ ted it.
I told my mom, "M@@ om, I'm having fun.
I'm here with my friends, I love travel@@ ing, being a beauty pag@@ e@@ ant que@@ en@@ ."
But then two weeks later she called me, she said, "Did you know that if you move to the United States you could change your name and gender mark@@ er@@ ?"
That was all I needed to hear@@ .
My mom also told me to put two E@@ 's in the sp@@ elling of my name.
She also came with me when I had my surgery in Thail@@ and at 19 years old.
It's interesting, in some of the most rural cities in Thail@@ and, they perform some of the most presti@@ gi@@ ous, safe and sophisticated surgery.
At that time in the United States, you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender mark@@ er.
So in 2001, I moved to San Francisco, and I remember looking at my California driver@@ 's license with the name Ge@@ ena and gender marker F.
That was a powerful moment.
For some people, their I.@@ D. is their license to drive or even to get a drin@@ k, but for me, that was my license to live, to feel dig@@ ni@@ fied.
All of a sudden, my fears were minim@@ iz@@ ed.
I felt that I could con@@ quer my dream and move to New York and be a model.
Many are not so fortun@@ ate.
I think of this woman named Isl@@ an Net@@ t@@ les.
She's from New York, she's a young woman who was cour@@ age@@ ously living her truth, but hat@@ red ended her life.
For most of my community, this is the reality in which we live.
Our suicide rate is nine times higher than that of the general population.
Every November 20, we have a global vig@@ il for Trans@@ gender Day of Re@@ membr@@ ance.
I'm here at this stage because it's a long history of people who fought and stood up for in@@ justice.
This is Mar@@ sh@@ a P. Johnson and Sylvia River@@ a.
Today, this very moment, is my real coming out.
I could no longer live my truth for and by myself.
I want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame and terror.
I am here, expos@@ ed, so that one day there will never be a need for a November 20 vig@@ il.
My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Kathr@@ yn Sch@@ ul@@ z: Ge@@ en@@ a, one quick question for you.
I'm wondering what you would say, especially to parents, but in a more broad way, to friends, to family, to anyone who finds themselves en@@ counter@@ ing a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that's being assigned them, what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them?
Ge@@ ena Roc@@ er@@ o: S@@ ure. Well, first, really, I'm so bl@@ esse@@ d.
The support system, with my mom especi@@ ally, and my family, that in itself is just so powerful.
I remember every time I would co@@ ach young tr@@ ans women, I would mentor them, and sometimes when they would call me and tell me that their parents can't accept it, I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom, "M@@ om, can you call this wo@@ man@@ ?"
And sometimes it works, sometimes it does@@ n't, so — But it's just, gender identity is in the core of our being, right?
I mean, we're all assigned gender at bir@@ th, so what I'm trying to do is to have this conversation that sometimes that gender assignment doesn't mat@@ ch, and there should be a space that would allow people to self-@@ identi@@ f@@ y, and that's a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagu@@ es.
The trans@@ gender movement, it's at the very beginning, to compare to how the gay movement started.
There's still a lot of work that needs to be done.
There should be an understanding.
There should be a space of curiosity and asking questions, and I hope all of you guys will be my alli@@ es.
KS: Thank you. That was so lo@@ vely. G@@ R: Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Pakist@@ ani educ@@ ator Z@@ i@@ aud@@ din You@@ saf@@ z@@ ai reminds the world of a simple truth that many don’t want to hear@@ : Women and men deserve equal opportunities for education, autonom@@ y, an independent identity. He tells stories from his own life and the life of his daughter, Mal@@ ala, who was shot by the Taliban in 20@@ 12 simply for dar@@ ing to go to school. "Why is my daughter so strong@@ ?” You@@ saf@@ z@@ ai as@@ ks. “@@ Because I did@@ n’t clip her wing@@ s."
Z@@ i@@ aud@@ din You@@ saf@@ z@@ ai@@ : My daughter, Mal@@ ala.
In many patri@@ arch@@ al societies and tribal societies, fathers are usually known by their sons, but I'm one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter, and I am proud of it.
Mal@@ ala started her campaign for education and stood for her rights in 2007, and when her efforts were honor@@ ed in 2011, and she was given the national youth peace pr@@ ize, and she became a very fam@@ ous, very popular young girl of her country.
Before that, she was my daughter, but now I am her father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we gl@@ ance to human history, the story of women is the story of in@@ justice, inequality, violence and explo@@ it@@ ation.
You see, in patri@@ arch@@ al societies, right from the very beginning, when a girl is born, her birth is not celebr@@ ated.
She is not wel@@ com@@ ed, neither by father nor by mother.
The neighborhood comes and com@@ miser@@ ates with the mother, and nobody congr@@ atul@@ ates the father.
And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child.
When she gives birth to the first girl child, first daughter, she is s@@ ad.
When she gives birth to the second daughter, she is shock@@ ed, and in the expect@@ ation of a son, when she gives birth to a third daughter, she feels guilty like a crimin@@ al.
Not only the mother suffer@@ s, but the daughter, the newly born daughter, when she grows old, she suffer@@ s too.
At the age of five, while she should be going to school, she stays at home and her brothers are admit@@ ted in a school.
Until the age of 12, somehow, she has a good life.
She can have fun.
She can play with her friends in the streets, and she can move around in the streets like a butter@@ fly.
But when she enters her te@@ ens, when she becomes 13 years old, she is for@@ bid@@ den to go out of her home without a male escor@@ t.
She is confined under the four walls of her home.
She is no more a free individual.
She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family, and if she trans@@ gr@@ esses the code of that so-called hon@@ or, she could even be killed.
And it is also interesting that this so-called code of hon@@ or, it does not only affect the life of a girl, it also affects the life of the male members of the family.
I know a family of seven sisters and one brother, and that one brother, he has mig@@ rated to the Gulf countries, to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents, because he thinks that it will be humili@@ ating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some li@@ vel@@ i@@ ho@@ od.
So this brother, he sacrific@@ es the jo@@ ys of his life and the happiness of his sisters at the altar of so-called hon@@ or.
And there is one more nor@@ m of the patri@@ arch@@ al societies that is called obedi@@ ence.
A good girl is supposed to be very qui@@ et, very humble and very sub@@ mis@@ si@@ ve.
It is the cr@@ iter@@ ia.
The role model good girl should be very qui@@ et.
She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elder@@ s, even if she does not like them.
If she is married to a man she doesn't like or if she is married to an old man, she has to accep@@ t, because she does not want to be dub@@ bed as dis@@ obedi@@ ent.
If she is married very ear@@ ly, she has to accep@@ t.
Other@@ wise, she will be called dis@@ obedi@@ ent.
And what happens at the end@@ ?
In the words of a po@@ et@@ ess, she is wed@@ ded, bed@@ ded, and then she gives birth to more sons and daugh@@ ters.
And it is the irony of the situation that this mother, she teaches the same lesson of obedi@@ ence to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her son@@ s.
And this vici@@ ous cycle goes on, goes on.
Ladies and gentlemen, this p@@ light of millions of women could be changed if we think differently, if women and men think differently, if men and women in the tribal and patri@@ arch@@ al societies in the developing countries, if they can break a few nor@@ ms of family and society, if they can abol@@ ish the discrimin@@ atory laws of the systems in their states, which go against the basic human rights of the women.
De@@ ar brothers and sis@@ ters, when Mal@@ ala was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like new@@ born children, to be honest, but when I went and I looked into her eyes, believe me, I got extremely honor@@ ed.
And long before she was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a heroic legend@@ ary freedom figh@@ ter in Afghanistan.
Her name was Mal@@ al@@ ai of Ma@@ i@@ w@@ and, and I named my daughter after her.
A few days after Mal@@ ala was born, my daughter was born, my cous@@ in came - and it was a coincid@@ ence - he came to my home and he brought a family tree, a family tree of the You@@ saf@@ z@@ ai family, and when I looked at the family tree, it trac@@ ed back to 300 years of our ancest@@ ors.
But when I look@@ ed, all were men, and I picked my pen@@ , drew a line from my name, and wrote, "M@@ al@@ al@@ a."
And when she grow old, when she was four and a half years old, I admit@@ ted her in my school.
You will be asking, then, why should I mention about the ad@@ mission of a girl in a school@@ ?
Yes, I must mention it.
It may be taken for granted in Canada, in America, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in patri@@ arch@@ al societies, in tribal societies, it's a big event for the life of girl.
En@@ rol@@ l@@ ment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name.
Ad@@ mission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspir@@ ations where she can explore her potenti@@ als for her future life.
I have five sis@@ ters, and none of them could go to school, and you will be aston@@ ished, two weeks before, when I was filling out the Canadian vis@@ a form, and I was filling out the family part of the form, I could not recall the sur@@ names of some of my sis@@ ters.
And the reason was that I have never, never seen the names of my sisters written on any document@@ .
That was the reason that I valu@@ ed my daughter.
What my father could not give to my sisters and to his daugh@@ ters, I thought I must change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilli@@ ance of my daughter.
I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come.
I encouraged her to go with me to different meet@@ ings.
And all these good values, I tried to in@@ cul@@ c@@ ate in her personality.
And this was not only sh@@ e, only Mal@@ ala.
I im@@ par@@ ted all these good values to my school, girl students and boy students as well.
I used education for eman@@ cip@@ ation.
I taught my girls, I taught my girl students, to un@@ learn the lesson of obedi@@ ence.
I taught my boy students to un@@ learn the lesson of so-called pse@@ u@@ do-@@ hon@@ or.
De@@ ar brothers and sis@@ ters, we were str@@ iving for more rights for women, and we were struggling to have more, more and more space for the women in society.
But we came across a new phenomenon.
It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women's rights.
It was called Taliban@@ iz@@ ation.
It means a complete neg@@ ation of women's participation in all politic@@ al, econom@@ ical and social activi@@ ties.
Hund@@ reds of schools were lost.
Gir@@ ls were prohi@@ bi@@ ted from going to school.
Women were forced to wear ve@@ ils and they were stopped from going to the markets.
Mus@@ ici@@ ans were sil@@ enc@@ ed, girls were f@@ log@@ ged and sing@@ ers were killed.
M@@ illi@@ ons were suffering, but few spo@@ ke, and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who f@@ log@@ , and you speak for your rights.
It's really the most scary thing.
At the age of 10, Mal@@ ala sto@@ od, and she stood for the right of education.
She wrote a di@@ ary for the B@@ BC blog, she volunte@@ ered herself for the New York Times document@@ aries, and she spoke from every platform she could.
And her voice was the most powerful voice.
It spread like a crescendo all around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban could not toler@@ ate her campaig@@ n, and on October 9 2012, she was shot in the head at point blank range.
It was a do@@ om@@ s@@ day for my family and for me.
The world turned into a big black hole.
While my daughter was on the ver@@ ge of life and death, I whis@@ per@@ ed into the ears of my wife, "S@@ h@@ ould I be bl@@ amed for what happened to my daughter and your daugh@@ ter@@ ?"
And she abr@@ up@@ tly told me, "P@@ lease don't blame yourself.
You stood for the right cause.
You put your life at st@@ ake for the cause of truth, for the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you.
You both were on the right path and God will protect her@@ ."
These few words meant a lot to me, and I didn't ask this question again.
When Mal@@ ala was in the hospital, and she was going through the severe pa@@ ins and she had had severe head@@ aches because her facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife.
But my daughter never complain@@ ed.
She used to tell us, "I'm fine with my cro@@ o@@ ked smile and with my num@@ b@@ ness in my face.
I'll be okay. Please don't worr@@ y."
She was a sol@@ ace for us, and she con@@ so@@ led us.
De@@ ar brothers and sis@@ ters, we learned from her how to be resili@@ ent in the most difficult times, and I'm glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, she is like any 16@@ -year old girl.
She cri@@ es when her homework is in@@ comple@@ te.
She quar@@ rel@@ s with her brother@@ s, and I am very happy for that.
People ask me, what special is in my ment@@ or@@ ship which has made Mal@@ ala so bold I tell them, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I did not do.
I did not clip her w@@ ings, and that's all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As an expert on cutt@@ ing-@@ edge digital dis@@ play@@ s, Mary L@@ ou J@@ ep@@ sen studies how to show our most creative ideas on scre@@ ens. And as a brain surgery patient her@@ self, she is driven to know more about the neural activity that under@@ lies inven@@ tion, creativity, thought. She mes@@ hes these two passi@@ ons in a rather mind-@@ blowing talk on two cutt@@ ing-@@ edge brain studies that might point to a new fronti@@ er in understanding how we think.
Mary L@@ ou J@@ ep@@ sen@@ : Could future devices read images from our brain@@ s?
I had brain surgery 18 years ago, and since that time, brain science has become a personal passion of mine.
I'm actually an engine@@ er.
And first let me say, I recently joined Goog@@ le's Mo@@ on@@ shot group, where I had a divis@@ ion, the display division in Google X, and the brain science work I'm speaking about today is work I did before I joined Google and on the side outside of Google.
So that said, there's a stig@@ ma when you have brain surgery.
Are you still smart or not?
And if not, can you make yourself smart again?
After my neuros@@ ur@@ ger@@ y, part of my brain was miss@@ ing, and I had to deal with that.
It wasn't the gre@@ y matter, but it was the go@@ o@@ ey part dead center that makes key hormon@@ es and neuro@@ transmit@@ ters.
Im@@ medi@@ ately after my surgery, I had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day, because if I just took nothing, I would die within hours.
Every day now for 18 years - every single day - I've had to try to decide the combin@@ ations and mix@@ tures of chemic@@ als, and try to get them, to stay alive.
There have been several close call@@ s.
But luckily, I'm an experiment@@ alist at heart, so I decided I would experiment to try to find more op@@ ti@@ mal dos@@ ages because there really isn't a clear road map on this that's deta@@ ile@@ d.
I began to try different mix@@ tures, and I was blown away by how tiny changes in dos@@ ages dramatically changed my sense of self, my sense of who I was, my thinking, my behavior towards people.
One particularly dramatic cas@@ e: for a couple months I actually tried dos@@ ages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20@@ s, and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.
I was angry all the time, I thought about sex const@@ ant@@ ly, and I thought I was the smar@@ test person in the entire world, and —@@ — of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that, or maybe kind of ton@@ ed-@@ down versions of that.
I was kind of extre@@ me.
But to me, the surprise was, I wasn't trying to be arrog@@ ant.
I was actually tr@@ ying, with a little bit of in@@ security, to actually fix a problem in front of me, and it just didn't come out that way.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my dos@@ ages.
But that experience, I think, gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through, and I've gotten along with men a lot better since then.
What I was trying to do with tun@@ ing these hormon@@ es and neuro@@ transmit@@ ters and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery, my creative thought, my idea flow@@ .
And I think mostly in images, and so for me that became a key metric - how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid proto@@ typ@@ ing, if you will, my ideas, trying on different new ideas for size, playing out scenari@@ os.
This kind of thinking isn't new.
Phili@@ os@@ op@@ hers like Hum@@ e and Des@@ car@@ tes and H@@ ob@@ bes saw things similar@@ ly.
They thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing.
There are those today that disput@@ e that, and lots of debates about how the mind works, but for me it's simple@@ : M@@ ental images, for most of us, are central in inv@@ enti@@ ve and creative thinking.
So after several years, I tuned myself up and I have lots of great, really vivi@@ d mental images with a lot of sophistica@@ tion and the analy@@ tical back@@ bone behind them.
And so now I'm working on, how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen fas@@ ter?
Can you imagine, if you will, a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her@@ ?
Or a musician to get the music out of his head@@ ?
There are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed.
And the truth is, the remaining bott@@ len@@ eck in being able to do this is just up@@ ping the resolution of brain scan systems.
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups.
Both used f@@ MRI technology - functional magnetic reson@@ ance imaging technology - to image the brain, and here is a brain scan set from Gi@@ or@@ gio G@@ an@@ is and his colleagues at Harvard.
And the left-hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image.
The middle column shows the brain@@ scan of that same individual imagin@@ ing, seeing that same image.
And the right column was created by sub@@ trac@@ ting the middle column from the left colum@@ n, showing the difference to be nearly zero.
This was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing.
Next let me share with you one other experiment, this from Jack Gall@@ ant@@ 's lab at C@@ al Berkele@@ y.
They've been able to de@@ code brain@@ waves into recogn@@ iz@@ able visual fields.
So let me set this up for you.
In this experiment, individuals were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while scans were made of their brains to create a large library of their brain reac@@ ting to video sequ@@ ences.
Then a new movie was shown with new images, new people, new animals in it, and a new scan set was recor@@ ded.
The computer, using brain scan data alone, de@@ coded that new brain scan to show what it thought the individual was actually see@@ ing.
On the right-hand side, you see the compu@@ ter's guess, and on the left-hand side, the presented cli@@ p.
This is the j@@ aw@@ -@@ drop@@ per.
We are so close to being able to do this.
We just need to up the resolu@@ tion.
And now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image, it creates the same brain scan@@ .
So this was done with the high@@ est-@@ resolution brain scan systems available today, and their resolution has increased really about a thousand@@ fold in the last several years.
Next we need to increase the resolution another thousand@@ fold to get a deeper glimp@@ se.
How do we do that?
There's a lot of techniques in this approach.
One way is to crack open your skull and put in electr@@ od@@ es.
I'm not for that.
There's a lot of new imaging techniques being propos@@ ed, some even by me, but given the recent success of MR@@ I, first we need to ask the question, is it the end of the road with this technolog@@ y?
Conven@@ tional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magne@@ ts, but at this point bigger magne@@ ts only offer incre@@ mental resolution improv@@ em@@ ents, not the thousand@@ fold we need.
I'm putting forward an idea: instead of bigger magne@@ ts, let's make better magne@@ ts.
There's some new technology break@@ through@@ s in nanos@@ ci@@ ence when applied to magnetic structures that have created a whole new class of magne@@ ts, and with these magne@@ ts, we can lay down very fine detailed magnetic field patterns throughout the brain, and using those, we can actually create h@@ olo@@ graph@@ ic@@ -like interfer@@ ence structures to get precis@@ ion control over many patterns, as is shown here by shifting things.
We can create much more complicated structures with slightly different arrang@@ em@@ ents, kind of like making S@@ pir@@ o@@ graph.
So why does that matter?
A lot of effort in MRI over the years has gone into making really big, really huge magne@@ ts, right?
But yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from ing@@ eni@@ ously clever en@@ co@@ ding and de@@ co@@ ding solutions in the F@@ .@@ M. radio frequency transmit@@ ters and recei@@ vers in the MRI systems.
Let's also, instead of a uni@@ form magnetic field, put down struc@@ tured magnetic patterns in addition to the F@@ .@@ M. radio frequ@@ encies.
So by combin@@ ing the magne@@ tics patterns with the patterns in the F@@ .@@ M. radio frequ@@ encies processing which can massively increase the information that we can extract in a single scan@@ .
And on top of that, we can then layer our ever-@@ growing knowledge of brain structure and memory to create a thousand@@ fold increase that we need.
And using f@@ MR@@ I, we should be able to measure not just oxygen@@ ated blood flow, but the hormon@@ es and neuro@@ transmit@@ ters I've talked about and maybe even the direct neural activity, which is the dream.
We're going to be able to dum@@ p our ideas directly to digital media.
Could you imagine if we could leap@@ frog language and communicate directly with human though@@ t?
What would we be capable of then?
And how will we learn to deal with the truths of un@@ fil@@ tered human though@@ t?
You think the Internet was big.
These are huge questions.
It might be ir@@ resis@@ tible as a tool to amp@@ lify our thinking and communication skills.
And indeed, this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have little option but to open this door.
Reg@@ ard@@ less, pick a year - will it happen in five years or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it taking much longer.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this touching talk, As@@ h B@@ eck@@ ham offers a fresh approach to empathy and open@@ ness. It starts with understanding that everyone, at some point in their life, has experienced hard@@ ship. The only way out, says B@@ eck@@ ham, is to open the door and step out of your clos@@ et.
As@@ h B@@ eck@@ h@@ am: We're all hiding something. Let's find the courage to open up.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the clos@@ et, and not in the traditional sense, not just the gay clos@@ et.
I think we all have clos@@ ets.
Your clos@@ et may be telling someone you love her for the first time, or telling someone that you're pregn@@ ant, or telling someone you have cancer, or any of the other hard conversations we have throughout our lives.
All a clos@@ et is is a hard conversation, and although our topics may vary tremend@@ ously, the experience of being in and coming out of the clos@@ et is universal.
It is scar@@ y, and we hate it, and it needs to be done.
Sever@@ al years ago, I was working at the South S@@ ide Wal@@ n@@ ut C@@ af@@ e, a local din@@ er in town, and during my time there I would go through phas@@ es of milit@@ ant les@@ bian inten@@ sit@@ y: not s@@ having my arm@@ pit@@ s, quo@@ ting An@@ i Di@@ Fran@@ co ly@@ ric@@ s as gos@@ pel@@ .
And depending on the bag@@ gin@@ ess of my cargo shor@@ ts and how recently I had s@@ hav@@ ed my head, the question would often be spr@@ ung on me, usually by a little kid@@ : "U@@ m, are you a boy or are you a girl@@ ?"
And there would be an awkward silence at the table.
I'd cl@@ en@@ ch my ja@@ w a little tigh@@ ter, hold my coffee pot with a little more ven@@ ge@@ ance.
The dad would awk@@ war@@ dly shu@@ ff@@ le his newspaper and the mom would shoot a ch@@ illing stare at her kid.
But I would say nothing, and I would see@@ the inside.
And it got to the point where every time I walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and 10 years old, I was ready to figh@@ t.
And that is a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself, the next time, I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So within a matter of weeks, it happens again.
"Are you a boy or are you a girl@@ ?"
Fam@@ ili@@ ar sil@@ ence, but this time I'm ready, and I am about to go all Wo@@ men's Stu@@ dies 10@@ 1 on this table. I've got my Bet@@ ty Fried@@ an quot@@ es.
I've got my Gl@@ oria Ste@@ in@@ em quot@@ es.
I've even got this little bit from "V@@ ag@@ ina Mon@@ olo@@ gu@@ es" I'm going to do.
So I take a deep breath and I look down and staring back at me is a four@@ -year-old girl in a pink dr@@ ess, not a challenge to a femin@@ ist du@@ el, just a kid with a question: "Are you a boy or are you a girl@@ ?"
So I take another deep breath, squ@@ at down to next to her, and say, "Hey, I know it's kind of confus@@ ing.
My hair is short like a boy@@ 's, and I wear bo@@ y's clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dr@@ ess, and sometimes you like to wear your com@@ fy jam@@ mi@@ es?
Well, I'm more of a com@@ fy jam@@ mi@@ es kind of girl@@ ."
And this kid looks me dead in the eye, without missing a be@@ at, and says, "My favorite pa@@ jam@@ as are purple with fish.
Can I get a pan@@ ca@@ ke, pleas@@ e?"
And that was it. Jus@@ t, "Oh, okay. You're a girl.
How about that pan@@ ca@@ ke@@ ?"
It was the easiest hard conversation I have ever had.
And why? Because Pan@@ cake Gir@@ l and I, we were both real with each other.
So like many of us, I've lived in a few clos@@ ets in my life, and yeah, most often, my walls happened to be rain@@ bo@@ w.
But inside, in the dark, you can't tell what color the walls are.
You just know what it feels like to live in a clos@@ et.
So really, my clos@@ et is no different than yours or yours or your@@ s.
S@@ ure, I'll give you 100 reasons why coming out of my clos@@ et was harder than coming out of your@@ s, but here's the thing: H@@ ard is not rel@@ ative.
H@@ ard is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone you've just declar@@ ed bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy is harder than telling someone you just che@@ ated on them?
Who can tell me that his coming out story is harder than telling your fi@@ ve@@ -year-old you're getting a divor@@ ce?
There is no hard@@ er, there is just hard.
We need to stop ran@@ king our hard against everyone else's hard to make us feel better or worse about our clos@@ ets and just com@@ miser@@ ate on the fact that we all have hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in clos@@ ets, and they may feel safe, or at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door.
But I am here to tell you, no matter what your walls are made of, a clos@@ et is no place for a person to live.
Thanks. So imagine yourself 20 years ago.
M@@ e, I had a pon@@ y@@ tail, a stra@@ pl@@ ess dr@@ ess, and high-@@ he@@ eled shoes.
I was not the milit@@ ant les@@ bian ready to fight any four@@ -year-old that walked into the caf@@ e.
I was frozen by fear, cur@@ led up in the corner of my pit@@ ch@@ -@@ black clos@@ et cl@@ ut@@ ching my gay gren@@ ade, and moving one muscle is the scar@@ iest thing I have ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strangers - I had spent my entire life trying to not disap@@ point these people, and now I was turning the world upside down on purpose.
I was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long, but if you do not throw that gren@@ ade, it will kill you.
One of my most memor@@ able gren@@ ade toss@@ es was at my sis@@ ter's wed@@ ding.
It was the first time that many in attend@@ ance knew I was gay, so in doing my mai@@ d of honor du@@ ties, in my black dress and he@@ els, I walked around to tables and finally landed on a table of my parent@@ s' friends, folks that had known me for years.
And after a little small talk, one of the women sh@@ ou@@ ted out, "I love Nathan L@@ ane@@ !"
And the battle of gay relat@@ ability had be@@ gun.
"A@@ sh@@ , have you ever been to the C@@ astr@@ o?"
"Well, yeah, actually, we have friends in San Francis@@ co."
"Well, we've never been there but we've heard it's fabul@@ ous@@ ."
"A@@ sh@@ , do you know my hair@@ dr@@ ess@@ er Anton@@ i@@ o?
He's really good and he has never talked about a girl@@ friend@@ ."
"A@@ sh@@ , what's your favorite TV show@@ ?
Our favorite TV show@@ ? F@@ av@@ ori@@ te: Will &amp; Gr@@ ac@@ e.
And you know who we lo@@ ve? Jac@@ k.
Jack is our favori@@ te."
And then one woman, stum@@ ped but wanting so desperately to show her support, to let me know she was on my side, she finally blur@@ ted out, "Well, sometimes my husband we@@ ars pink shir@@ t@@ s."
And I had a choice in that moment, as all gren@@ ade thro@@ w@@ ers do.
I could go back to my girl@@ friend and my gay@@ -lo@@ ving table and m@@ ock their respons@@ es, chas@@ ti@@ se their un@@ world@@ lin@@ ess and their in@@ ability to jump through the politically correct gay ho@@ ops I had brought with me, or I could empath@@ ize with them and realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done, that starting and having that conversation was them coming out of their clos@@ ets.
S@@ ure, it would have been easy to point out where they felt shor@@ t.
It's a lot harder to meet them where they are and acknowledge the fact that they were tr@@ ying.
And what else can you ask someone to do but tr@@ y?
If you're going to be real with someone, you gotta be ready for real in return.
So hard conversations are still not my strong suit.
Ask anybody I have ever d@@ ated.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three Pan@@ cake Gir@@ l princi@@ ples.
Now, please view this through gay@@ -@@ colored l@@ ens@@ es, but know what it takes to come out of any clos@@ et is essentially the same.
Number one: Be auth@@ en@@ tic.
Take the arm@@ or off. Be yourself.
That kid in the ca@@ fe had no ar@@ mor@@ , but I was ready for batt@@ le.
If you want someone to be real with you, they need to know that you ble@@ ed too.
Number two: Be direc@@ t. Just say it. Ri@@ p the Band-@@ Aid off.
If you know you are gay, just say it.
If you tell your parents you might be gay, they will hold out hope that this will change.
Do not give them that sense of false hope.
And number three, and most important - Be un@@ ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic.
You are speaking your truth.
Never apolog@@ ize for that.
And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way, so sure, apolog@@ ize for what you've done, but never apolog@@ ize for who you are.
And yeah, some folks may be disap@@ po@@ inte@@ d, but that is on them, not on you.
Those are their expectations of who you are, not your@@ s.
That is their story, not your@@ s.
The only story that matters is the one that you want to wri@@ te.
So the next time you find yourself in a pit@@ ch@@ -@@ black clos@@ et cl@@ ut@@ ching your gren@@ ade, know we have all been there before.
And you may feel so very alone, but you are not.
And we know it's hard but we need you out here, no matter what your walls are made of, because I guarantee you there are others pe@@ ering through the key@@ holes of their clos@@ ets looking for the next brave soul to b@@ ust a door open, so be that person and show the world that we are bigger than our clos@@ ets and that a clos@@ et is no place for a person to truly live.
Thank you, B@@ oul@@ der. En@@ joy your night.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Is there an equation for intelligen@@ ce? Yes. It's F = T ∇ S@@ τ@@ . In a fascinating and informa@@ tive talk, physicist and computer scientist Alex W@@ iss@@ ner@@ -@@ G@@ ros@@ s explains what in the world that means.
Alex W@@ iss@@ ner@@ -@@ G@@ ros@@ s: A new equation for intelligence.
Intel@@ ligen@@ ce - what is it?
If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been view@@ ed, one seminal example has been Ed@@ s@@ ger Di@@ j@@ k@@ str@@ a's famous quote that "the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submar@@ ine can swim@@ ."
Now, Ed@@ s@@ ger Di@@ j@@ k@@ str@@ a, when he wrote this, intended it as a critic@@ ism of the early pione@@ ers of computer science, like Alan Tur@@ ing.
However, if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that [@@ fly@@ ], you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines.
And so, several years ago, I under@@ took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
Let's first begin with a thought experiment.
Pre@@ tend that you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence, but you have amazing telescopes and you're able to watch the Earth, and you have amazingly long lives, so you're able to watch the Earth over milli@@ ons, even billions of years.
And you observe a really strange effect.
You observe that, over the course of the millen@@ nia, Earth is continu@@ ally bombar@@ ded with asteroids up until a point, and that at some point, correspon@@ ding roughly to our year, 2000 A@@ D, asteroids that are on a collis@@ ion course with the Earth that otherwise would have col@@ lid@@ ed myster@@ i@@ ously get def@@ lec@@ ted or they de@@ ton@@ ate before they can hit the Earth.
Now of course, as earth@@ l@@ ings, we know the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to prevent an impact.
But if you're an alien race who doesn't know any of this, doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence, you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how, up until a certain point in time, asteroids that would demol@@ ish the surface of a planet myster@@ i@@ ously stop doing that.
And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I under@@ took several years ago, I looked at a variety of different thre@@ ads across science, across a variety of disciplin@@ es, that were poin@@ ting, I think, towards a single, underlying mechanism for intelligence.
In cosm@@ ology, for example, there have been a variety of different thre@@ ads of evidence that our universe appears to be fin@@ ely tuned for the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that maxim@@ ize the diversity of possible futur@@ es.
In game play, for example, in Go - everyone remem@@ bers in 199@@ 7 when I@@ BM@@ 's Deep Blue beat G@@ arry K@@ as@@ par@@ o@@ v at chess - fewer people are aware that in the past 10 years or so, the game of G@@ o, argu@@ ably a much more challenging game because it has a much higher bran@@ ching fac@@ tor, has also started to succ@@ umb to computer game players for the same reason@@ : the best techniques right now for computers playing G@@ o.
Are techniques that try to maxim@@ ize future options during game play.
Finally, in robotic motion plan@@ ning, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots to maxim@@ ize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex tas@@ ks.
And so, taking all of these different thre@@ ads and putting them together, I asked, starting several years ago, is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different thre@@ ad@@ s?
Is there a single equation for intelligen@@ ce?
And the answer, I believe, is yes. ["@@ F = T ∇ S@@ τ@@ "] What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E = m@@ c@@ ² for intelligence that I've seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement of correspond@@ ence that intelligence is a force, F, that acts so as to maxim@@ ize future freedom of action.
It acts to maxim@@ ize future freedom of action, or keep options open, with some strength T, with the diversity of possible accessible futur@@ es, S, up to some future time horiz@@ on, ta@@ u.
In short, intelligence doesn't like to get tr@@ appe@@ d.
Intel@@ ligen@@ ce tries to maxim@@ ize future freedom of action and keep options open.
And so, given this one equ@@ ation, it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?
How predic@@ tive is it?
Does it predict human-@@ level intelligen@@ ce?
Does it predict artificial intelligen@@ ce?
So I'm going to show you now a video that will, I think, demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equ@@ ation.
Narrator: Rec@@ ent research in cosm@@ ology has suggested that univers@@ es that produce more disorder, or "@@ entrop@@ y," over their life@@ times should tend to have more favor@@ able conditions for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves.
But what if that tent@@ ative cosm@@ ological connection between entropy and intelligence hin@@ ts at a deeper relationshi@@ p@@ ?
What if intelligent behavior doesn't just cor@@ relate with the production of long-term entrop@@ y, but actually emerg@@ es directly from it?
To find out, we developed a software engine called En@@ trop@@ ica, designed to maxim@@ ize the production of long-term entropy of any system that it finds itself in.
Amaz@@ ingly, En@@ trop@@ ica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence test@@ s, play human games, and even earn money trading stoc@@ ks, all without being instruc@@ ted to do so.
Here are some examples of En@@ trop@@ ica in action.
Just like a human standing upr@@ ight without falling over, here we see En@@ trop@@ ica automatically bal@@ ancing a pole using a car@@ t.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave En@@ trop@@ ica a goal.
It simply decided on its own to balance the po@@ le.
This bal@@ ancing ability will have appli@@ actions for human@@ o@@ id robotics and human assis@@ tive technologies.
Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces, here we see that En@@ trop@@ ica, again on its own initi@@ ative, was able to move a large dis@@ k representing an animal around so as to cause a small dis@@ k, representing a tool, to reach into a confined space holding a third dis@@ k and release the third dis@@ k from its initially fixed position.
This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just as some other animals are able to cooper@@ ate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that En@@ trop@@ ica is able to accomplish a model version of that task.
This cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
En@@ trop@@ ica is broad@@ ly applic@@ able to a variety of do@@ main@@ s.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of pon@@ g against itself, illustr@@ ating its potential for gam@@ ing.
Here we see En@@ trop@@ ica orchestr@@ ating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected.
This same network orchestr@@ ation ability also has applications in health care, energy, and intelligence.
Here we see En@@ trop@@ ica direc@@ ting the paths of a fle@@ et of shi@@ ps, successfully discovering and utiliz@@ ing the Pan@@ ama Can@@ al to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific@@ .
By the same tok@@ en, En@@ trop@@ ica is broad@@ ly applic@@ able to problems in autonomous defen@@ se, logis@@ tics and transport@@ ation.
Finally, here we see En@@ trop@@ ica spontane@@ ously discovering and execut@@ ing a bu@@ y-@@ low, sell@@ -@@ high strategy on a simulated range trad@@ ed stoc@@ k, successfully growing assets under management expon@@ enti@@ ally.
This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insur@@ ance.
Alex W@@ iss@@ ner@@ -@@ G@@ ros@@ s: So what you've just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upr@@ ight and social cooperation all follow from a single equ@@ ation, which drives a system to maxim@@ ize its future freedom of action.
Now, there's a profound irony here.
Going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot, the play "R@@ U@@ R@@ ," there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence, there would be a cyber@@ ne@@ tic revol@@ t.
The machines would rise up against us.
One major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of cyber@@ ne@@ tic revol@@ t in rever@@ se.
It's not that machines first become intelligent and then me@@ gal@@ o@@ mani@@ ac@@ al and try to take over the world.
It's quite the opposi@@ te, that the urge to take control of all possible fu@@ tures is a more fundamental principle than that of intelligence, that general intelligence may in fact emerge directly from this sort of control@@ -@@ grab@@ b@@ ing, rather than vice versa.
Another important consequence is goal see@@ king.
I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals follow from this sort of frame@@ work?
And the answer is, the ability to seek goals will follow directly from this in the following sen@@ se: just like you would travel through a tunnel@@ , a bott@@ len@@ eck in your future path space, in order to achieve many other diverse objec@@ tives later on, or just like you would invest in a financial security, reducing your short-term liqu@@ id@@ ity in order to increase your wealth over the long term, goal seeking emerg@@ es direc@@ tly.
From a long-term drive to increase future freedom of action.
Finally, Richard Feyn@@ man, famous physic@@ ist, once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descend@@ ants to help them rebuild civilization, that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they're far apart but re@@ pel each other when they're close together.
My equivalent of that statement to pass on to descend@@ ants to help them build artificial intelligen@@ ces or to help them understand human intelligence, is the follow@@ ing: Intel@@ ligen@@ ce should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maxim@@ ize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: S@@ tel@@ lar astronom@@ er and TED Sen@@ ior Fellow Lu@@ ci@@ anne Walk@@ ow@@ ic@@ z works on NAS@@ A's Kepl@@ er mission, searching for places in the universe that could support life. So it's worth a listen when she asks us to think carefully about Mars. In this short talk, she suggests that we stop dream@@ ing of Mars as a place that we'll eventually move to when we've mes@@ sed up Earth, and to start thinking of planetary exploration and preserv@@ ation of the Earth as two sides of the same goal. As she says, "The more you look for planets like Earth, the more you appreciate our own planet@@ ."
Lu@@ ci@@ anne Walk@@ ow@@ ic@@ z: Let's not use Mars as a backup planet.
We're at a tip@@ ping point in human history, a species pois@@ ed between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home.
Even in just the past few years, we've great@@ ly expanded our knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe.
NAS@@ A's Kepl@@ er mission has discovered thousands of potential planets around other stars, indic@@ ating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepl@@ er is a space telescope that measures the subtle dim@@ ming of stars as planets pass in front of them, blocking just a little bit of that light from reaching us.
Kepl@@ er's data reveals planet@@ s' si@@ zes as well as their distance from their parent star.
Toge@@ ther, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rock@@ y, like the ter@@ restrial planets in our own Solar Sys@@ tem, and also how much light they receive from their parent sun.
In turn, this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover might be habit@@ able or not.
Unfortunately, at the same time as we're discovering this treas@@ ure tro@@ ve of potentially habit@@ able worl@@ ds, our own planet is s@@ ag@@ ging under the weight of humanity.
201@@ 4 was the hot@@ test year on record.
Gl@@ aci@@ ers and sea ice that have been with us for millen@@ nia are now disappear@@ ing in a matter of decades.
These planet@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale environmental changes that we have set in motion are rapidly out@@ pac@@ ing our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a climate scientist, I'm an astronom@@ er.
I study planetary habit@@ ability as influenced by stars with the hopes of finding the places in the universe where we might discover life beyond our own planet.
You could say that I look for choice alien real est@@ ate.
Now, as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth, the more you appreciate our own planet itself.
Each one of these new worlds invi@@ tes a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best@@ : those of our own Solar Sys@@ tem.
Consider our neigh@@ bor, Mars.
Mars is small and rock@@ y, and though it's a bit far from the Sun, it might be considered a potentially habit@@ able world if found by a mission like Kepl@@ er.
Indeed, it's possible that Mars was habit@@ able in the past, and in part, this is why we study Mars so much.
Our ro@@ vers, like Curi@@ os@@ ity, craw@@ l across its surface, scrat@@ ching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it.
Or@@ bit@@ ers like the M@@ AV@@ E@@ N mission sample the Mar@@ tian atmosphere, trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habit@@ ability.
Pri@@ v@@ ate spac@@ ef@@ light companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tant@@ alizing possibility of living our lives on Mars.
But though these Mar@@ tian vistas resem@@ ble the deser@@ ts of our own home world, places that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pione@@ ering and fronti@@ ers, compared to Earth Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Consider the extent to which we have not colon@@ ized the deser@@ ts of our own planet, places that are lus@@ h by comparison with Mars.
Even in the dri@@ est, highest places on Earth, the air is sweet and thick with oxygen ex@@ hal@@ ed from thousands of miles away by our rain@@ forests.
I worry - I worry that this excitement about colon@@ izing Mars and other planets carries with it a long, dark shado@@ w@@ : the implic@@ ation and belief by some that Mars will be there to save us from the self-@@ in@@ flic@@ ted destruction of the only truly habit@@ able planet we know of, the Earth.
As much as I love inter@@ planetary explor@@ ation, I deeply disagree with this idea.
There are many excellent reasons to go to Mars, but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity is like the cap@@ tain of the Titan@@ ic telling you that the real party is happening later on the life@@ bo@@ ats.
Thank you.
But the goals of inter@@ planetary exploration and planetary preserv@@ ation are not opposed to one another.
No, they're in fact two sides of the same go@@ al: to understand, preserve and improve life into the future.
The extreme environments of our own world are alien v@@ istas.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain habit@@ able spaces out of hos@@ ti@@ le, inh@@ os@@ pit@@ able spaces here on Earth, perhaps we can meet the needs of both preser@@ ving our own environment and moving beyond it.
I leave you with a final thought experiment@@ : Fer@@ mi@@ 's paradox@@ .
Many years ago, the physicist En@@ rico Fer@@ mi asked that, given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it, we should have found evidence for alien life by now.
So where are they@@ ?
Well, one possible solution to Fer@@ mi@@ 's paradox is that, as civilizations become technolog@@ ically advanced enough to consider living amongst the stars, they lose sight of how important it is to safe@@ guard the home worlds that fos@@ tered that advanc@@ ement to begin with.
It is hu@@ br@@ is to believe that inter@@ planetary colon@@ ization alone will save us from ourselves, but planetary preserv@@ ation and inter@@ planetary exploration can work together.
If we truly believe in our ability to bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habit@@ ation, then we should be able to sur@@ moun@@ t the far easier task of preser@@ ving the habit@@ ability of the Earth.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: You're not at your best when you're str@@ esse@@ d. In fact, your brain has evolved over millen@@ nia to release corti@@ sol in stress@@ ful situ@@ ations, inh@@ ib@@ iting ration@@ al, logical thinking but potentially helping you survive, say, being attacked by a li@@ on. Neur@@ os@@ cienti@@ st Daniel Levi@@ tin thinks there's a way to avoid making critical mistakes in stress@@ ful situ@@ ations, when your thinking becomes clou@@ ded - the pre-@@ mor@@ tem. "We all are going to fail now and then@@ ," he say@@ s. "The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be@@ ."
Daniel L@@ evit@@ in: How to stay calm when you know you'll be str@@ esse@@ d.
A few years ago, I broke into my own house.
I had just driven home, it was around mid@@ night in the dead of Mon@@ tre@@ al winter@@ , I had been visiting my friend, Jef@@ f, across town, and the ther@@ mo@@ meter on the front por@@ ch read minus 40 degrees - and don't bother asking if that's Celsi@@ us or F@@ ah@@ ren@@ he@@ it, minus 40 is where the two scales meet - it was very cold.
And as I stood on the front por@@ ch fum@@ bling in my pocket@@ s, I found I didn't have my key@@ s.
In fact, I could see them through the window, lying on the din@@ ing room table where I had left them.
So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windo@@ ws, and they were locked tigh@@ t.
I thought about calling a lock@@ sm@@ ith - at least I had my cell@@ phone, but at mid@@ night, it could take a while for a lock@@ sm@@ ith to show up, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend Jef@@ f@@ 's house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I needed to get my pass@@ port and my suit@@ case.
So, desperate and free@@ zing cold, I found a large rock and I broke through the bas@@ ement window, clear@@ ed out the shar@@ ds of glass, I craw@@ led through, I found a piece of cardboard and ta@@ ped it up over the open@@ ing, figuring that in the morning, on the way to the airport@@ , I could call my contrac@@ tor and ask him to fix it.
This was going to be expensive, but probably no more expensive than a middle-@@ of-@@ the-@@ night lock@@ smi@@ th, so I fig@@ ured, under the circumst@@ ances, I was coming out ev@@ en.
Now, I'm a neurosci@@ enti@@ st by training and I know a little bit about how the brain perfor@@ ms under stress.
It releas@@ es corti@@ sol that raises your heart rate, it modul@@ ates adr@@ enal@@ ine levels and it clouds your thinking.
So the next morning, when I woke up on too little sleep, worrying about the hole in the window, and a mental note that I had to call my contrac@@ tor, and the free@@ zing temperatur@@ es, and the meetings I had up@@ coming in Europe, and, you know, with all the corti@@ sol in my brain, my thinking was clou@@ dy, but I didn't know it was clou@@ dy because my thinking was clou@@ d@@ y.
And it wasn't until I got to the air@@ port chec@@ k-@@ in coun@@ ter, that I realized I didn't have my pass@@ port@@ .
So I rac@@ ed home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes, got my pass@@ port@@ , rac@@ ed back to the airport@@ , I made it just in time, but they had given away my seat to someone else, so I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathro@@ om@@ s, in a seat that wouldn't re@@ clin@@ e, on an eight-@@ hour flight.
Well, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep.
And I started wondering, are there things that I can do, systems that I can put into place, that will prevent bad things from happen@@ ing?
Or at least if bad things happen, will minim@@ ize the likelihood of it being a total catastroph@@ e.
So I started thinking about that, but my thoughts didn't cryst@@ al@@ liz@@ e until about a month later.
I was having dinner with my colleagu@@ e, Danny Kah@@ n@@ em@@ an, the Nobel Prize win@@ ner, and I somewhat embarr@@ asse@@ dly told him about having broken my window, and, you know, forgotten my pass@@ port@@ , and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospec@@ tive hind@@ sight.
It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Kle@@ in, who had written about it a few years before, also called the pre-@@ mor@@ tem.
Now, you all know what the post@@ mor@@ tem is.
Whenever there's a disas@@ ter, a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right?
Well, in the pre-@@ mor@@ tem, Danny explain@@ ed, you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening, or to minim@@ ize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-@@ mor@@ tem.
Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious.
I'll start with the obvious ones.
Around the home, design@@ ate a place for things that are easily lost.
Now, this sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science to back this up, based on the way our spatial memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called the hip@@ pocamp@@ us, that evolved over tens of thousands of years, to keep track of the locations of important things - where the well is, where fish can be found, that stand of fruit trees, where the friendly and enemy tribes live.
The hip@@ pocamp@@ us is the part of the brain that in London tax@@ ic@@ ab drivers becomes en@@ larg@@ ed.
It's the part of the brain that allows squ@@ ir@@ rel@@ s to find their nut@@ s.
And if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the ol@@ factory sense of the squ@@ ir@@ rel@@ s, and they could still find their nut@@ s.
They weren't using smell, they were using the hip@@ pocamp@@ us, this ex@@ quisi@@ tely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things.
But it's really good for things that don't move around much, not so good for things that move around.
So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and pass@@ port@@ s.
So in the home, design@@ ate a spot for your keys - a hook by the door, maybe a decor@@ ative bow@@ l.
For your pass@@ port@@ , a particular draw@@ er.
For your reading glass@@ es, a particular table.
If you design@@ ate a spot and you're scr@@ up@@ ul@@ ous about it, your things will always be there when you look for them.
What about travel@@ ?
Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards, your driver@@ 's licen@@ se, your pass@@ port@@ , mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.
If these things are lost or st@@ ol@@ en, you can facilit@@ ate replac@@ ement.
Now these are some rather obvious things.
Remember, when you're under str@@ ess, the brain releas@@ es corti@@ sol.
Cor@@ ti@@ sol is tox@@ ic, and it causes clou@@ dy thinking.
So part of the practice of the pre-@@ mor@@ tem is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best, and you should put systems in place.
And there's perhaps no more stress@@ ful a situation than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make.
And at some point, all of us are going to be in that position, where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this stands as a pro@@ x@@ y for all kinds of medical decision-@@ making, and indeed for financial decision-@@ making, and social decision-making - any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assess@@ ment of the facts.
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says, "I just got your lab work back, your chol@@ ester@@ ol@@ 's a little high@@ ."
Now, you all know that high chol@@ ester@@ ol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, strok@@ e.
And so you're thinking having high chol@@ ester@@ ol isn't the best thing, and so the doctor says, "You know, I'd like to give you a drug that will help you lower your chol@@ ester@@ ol, a stat@@ in@@ ."
And you've probably heard of stat@@ ins, you know that they're among the most widely prescri@@ bed drugs in the world today, you probably even know people who take them.
And so you're thinking, "@@ Yeah@@ ! Give me the stat@@ in@@ ."
But there's a question you should ask at this point, a stati@@ stic you should ask for that most doctors don't like talking about, and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less.
It's for the number needed to tre@@ at.
Now, what is this, the N@@ N@@ T@@ ?
It's the number of people that need to take a drug or under@@ go a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is hel@@ ped.
And you're thinking, what kind of crazy stati@@ stic is that?
The number should be one.
My doctor wouldn't prescri@@ be something to me if it's not going to help.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not the doctor@@ 's faul@@ t, if it's any@@ body's faul@@ t, it's the fault of scientists like me.
We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough.
But G@@ la@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescri@@ bed stat@@ in, what do you suppose it is?
How many people have to take it before one person is hel@@ ped@@ ?
3@@ 00.
This is according to research by research prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers Jer@@ ome Gro@@ op@@ man and P@@ am@@ ela Har@@ tz@@ b@@ and, independ@@ ently confir@@ med by Bloom@@ ber@@ g@@ .com.
I ran through the numbers myself.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack, stroke or other adver@@ se event is prev@@ ented.
Now you're probably thinking, "Well, OK, one in 300 chance of low@@ ering my chol@@ ester@@ ol.
Why not, doc@@ ? Give me the prescription any@@ way."
But you should ask at this point for another statis@@ tic, and that is, "T@@ ell me about the side effec@@ t@@ s." Right?
So for this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
And they include terrible things - de@@ bilit@@ ating muscle and joint pain, gas@@ tro@@ intest@@ inal distr@@ ess - but now you're thinking, "F@@ ive percent, not very likely it's going to happen to me, I'll still take the drug@@ ."
But wait a minute.
Remember under stress you're not thinking clear@@ ly.
So think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time, so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reason@@ ing on the spo@@ t.
300 people take the drug, right? One person's hel@@ ped, five percent of those 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You're 15 times more likely to be har@@ med by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug@@ .
Now, I'm not saying whether you should take the st@@ atin or not.
I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor.
Medical eth@@ ics requires it, it's part of the principle of informed cons@@ ent.
You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Now you might be thinking I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value, but in fact it's rather typic@@ al, this number needed to tre@@ at.
For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50, re@@ mov@@ al of the prostate for cancer, the number needed to treat is 4@@ 9.
That's right, 4@@ 9 surgeries are done for every one person who's hel@@ ped.
And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients.
They include im@@ poten@@ ce, erec@@ tile dys@@ function, ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence, rec@@ tal te@@ ar@@ ing, fecal in@@ contin@@ ence.
And if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these, they'll only last for a year or two.
So the idea of the pre-@@ mor@@ tem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward.
You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spo@@ t.
And you also want to think about things like quality of life.
Because you have a choice of@@ t@@ enti@@ mes, do you I want a shorter life that's pain@@ -@@ free, or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end@@ ?
These are things to talk about and think about now, with your family and your loved ones.
You might change your mind in the heat of the moment, but at least you're practic@@ ed with this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain under stress releas@@ es corti@@ sol, and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
F@@ ac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face with a predat@@ or, you don't need your dig@@ estive system, or your lib@@ ido, or your immune system, because if you're body is expen@@ ding metabol@@ ism on those things and you don't react quickly, you might become the li@@ on's lun@@ ch, and then none of those things matter.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is ration@@ al, logical thinking, as Danny Kah@@ ne@@ man and his colleagues have sho@@ wn.
So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations.
I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flaw@@ ed.
We all are going to fail now and then.
The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be, to put systems in place that will help minim@@ ize the dam@@ age, or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place.
Get@@ ting back to that snow@@ y night in Mont@@ real, when I got back from my tri@@ p, I had my contrac@@ tor install a combination lock next to the door, with a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combin@@ ation.
And I have to adm@@ it, I still have piles of mail that haven't been sor@@ ted, and piles of emails that I haven't gone through.
So I'm not completely organiz@@ ed, but I see organization as a grad@@ ual process, and I'm getting there.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Arti@@ st and TED Fellow Christ@@ ine Sun Kim was born deaf@@ , and she was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of her life, that it was a hearing person's thing. Through her art, she discovered simil@@ arities between American S@@ ign Langu@@ age and music, and she realized that sound doesn't have to be known sol@@ ely through the ears - it can be fel@@ t, seen and experienced as an idea. In this ende@@ aring talk, she invi@@ tes us to open our eyes and ears and participate in the rich treas@@ ure of visual language.
Christ@@ ine Sun Kim@@ : The ench@@ ant@@ ing music of sign language.
Inter@@ pre@@ ter: Pi@@ ano, "@@ p@@ ," is my favorite musical symbol@@ .
It means to play sof@@ tly.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a "@@ p@@ " in the sco@@ re, you need to play sof@@ ter.
Two p@@ 's - even sof@@ ter.
Four p@@ 's - extremely sof@@ t.
This is my drawing of a p-@@ tree, which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p@@ 's there may be, you'll never reach complete silence.
That's my current definition of sil@@ ence: a very obs@@ cure sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of American S@@ ign Langu@@ age, AS@@ L, plus a bit of my own background.
French sign language was brought to America during the early 18@@ 00@@ s, and as time went by, mixed with local sign@@ s, it evolved into the language we know today as AS@@ L@@ .
So it has a history of about 200 years.
I was born deaf@@ , and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I believed it to be true.
Yet, I realize now that that wasn't the case at all.
S@@ ound was very much a part of my life, really, on my mind every day.
As a De@@ a@@ f person living in a world of sound, it's as if I was living in a foreign country, blind@@ ly following its rules, custom@@ s, behaviors and nor@@ ms without ever questioning them.
So how is it that I understand sound@@ ?
Well, I watch how people behave and respond to sound.
You people are like my lou@@ d@@ speak@@ ers, and amp@@ lify sound.
I learn and mirror that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I create sound, and I've seen how people respond to me.
Th@@ us I've learned, for example ...
"Don't sl@@ am the door@@ !"
"Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the pot@@ at@@ o-@@ chip bag@@ !"
"Don't bur@@ p, and when you're e@@ ating, make sure you don't scr@@ ape your uten@@ sil@@ s on the plate@@ ."
All of these things I term "@@ sound etiqu@@ et@@ te."
Maybe I think about sound etiqu@@ ette more than the average hearing person does.
I'm hyper-@@ vigil@@ ant around sound.
And I'm always waiting in e@@ ager nervous anticip@@ ation around sound, about what's to come next.
H@@ ence, this draw@@ ing.
TB@@ D, to be decid@@ ed.
TB@@ C, to be continu@@ ed.
TB@@ A, to be announc@@ ed.
And you notice the staff - there are no notes contained in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle s@@ mud@@ ges and s@@ me@@ ars.
In De@@ a@@ f culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is a sign for "@@ staf@@ f@@ " in AS@@ L@@ .
A typical staff contains five lines.
Yet for me, sig@@ ning it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn't feel natural.
That's why you'll notice in my draw@@ ings, I stick to four lines on paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Ber@@ lin, Germany, for an artist resid@@ ency there.
Pri@@ or to this time, I had been working as a pa@@ inter@@ .
During this summer, I visited different muse@@ ums and gall@@ ery spaces, and as I went from one place to the next, I noticed there was no visual art there.
At that time, sound was tr@@ end@@ ing, and this struck me ...
There was no visual art, everything was aud@@ itor@@ y.
Now sound has come into my art territor@@ y.
Is it going to further distance me from ar@@ t?
I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all.
I actually know sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears.
It could be felt t@@ actually, or experienced as a visual, or even as an idea.
So I decided to re@@ claim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice.
And everything that I had been taught regar@@ ding sound, I decided to do away with and un@@ learn.
I started creating a new body of work.
And when I presented this to the art community, I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I recei@@ ved.
I realiz@@ ed: sound is like money, power, control - social curr@@ ency.
In the back of my mind, I've always felt that sound was your thing, a hearing person's thing.
And sound is so powerful that it could either dis@@ empower me and my art@@ work, or it could empower me.
I chose to be empower@@ ed.
There's a massive culture around spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communic@@ ate, in societ@@ y's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all.
So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice.
And that way, I'm able to maintain relev@@ ancy in society today.
So at school, at work and institutions, I work with many different AS@@ L interpre@@ ters.
And their voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me to be heard.
And their voices hold value and curr@@ ency.
Ir@@ on@@ ically, by borro@@ wing out their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of curr@@ ency, kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I didn't continue this practice, I feel that I could just f@@ ade off into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on and not maintain any form of social curr@@ ency.
So with sound as my new art medi@@ um, I del@@ ved into the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the simil@@ arities between music and AS@@ L@@ .
For example, a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper.
And the same holds true for a concept in AS@@ L@@ .
They're both highly spatial and highly inf@@ lec@@ ted - meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor@@ , to have you have a better understanding of how AS@@ L works.
So, en@@ vision a piano.
AS@@ L is broken down into many different gram@@ ma@@ tical parame@@ ters.
If you ass@@ ign a different parame@@ ter to each finger as you play the piano - such as facial express@@ ion, body movement, speed, hand shape and so on, as you play the piano - English is a linear language, as if one key is being pressed at a time.
However, AS@@ L is more like a chor@@ d - all 10 fingers need to come down simultane@@ ously to express a clear concept or idea in AS@@ L@@ .
If just one of those keys were to change the chor@@ d, it would create a completely different meaning.
The same applies to music in regar@@ ds to pit@@ ch, tone and volume.
In AS@@ L, by playing around with these different gram@@ ma@@ tical parame@@ ters, you can express different ideas.
For example, take the sign T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ OK@@ -@@ A@@ T.
This is the sign T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ OK@@ -@@ A@@ T.
I'm looking at you.
Star@@ ing at you.
Oh - bus@@ ted.
U@@ h-@@ o@@ h.
What are you looking at?
A@@ w, stop.
I then started thinking, "What if I was to look at AS@@ L through a musical l@@ ens@@ ?"
If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign for "@@ day@@ ," as the sun ris@@ es and se@@ ts.
This is "@@ all day@@ ."
If I was to repeat it and slow it down, visually it looks like a piece of music.
All ... day.
I feel the same holds true for "@@ all nigh@@ t."
"All nigh@@ t."
This is AL@@ L@@ -@@ NI@@ G@@ H@@ T, represented in this draw@@ ing.
And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of night@@ s: "@@ last night@@ ," "@@ over@@ night@@ ," "@@ all night long@@ ."
I feel like the third one has a lot more music@@ ality than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in AS@@ L and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time.
For example, 1@@ H is one hand, 2@@ H is two hand, present ten@@ se happens closest and in front of the body, future is in front of the body and the past is to your back.
So, the first example is "a long time ag@@ o."
Then "@@ pas@@ t@@ ," "@@ used to@@ " and the last one, which is my favori@@ te, with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it, "@@ once upon a time."
"Com@@ mon time@@ " is a musical term with a specific time signature of four be@@ ats per meas@@ ure.
Yet when I see the word "@@ common time@@ ," what automatically comes to mind for me is "@@ at the same time."
So notice R@@ H: right hand, L@@ H: left hand.
We have the staff across the head and the ch@@ est.
[@@ He@@ ad@@ : R@@ H, F@@ las@@ h cl@@ aw@@ ] [@@ Com@@ mon time@@ ] [@@ Ch@@ est@@ : L@@ H, F@@ las@@ h cl@@ aw@@ ] I'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the "@@ flash cl@@ aw@@ ."
Can you please follow along with me?
Every@@ body, hands up.
Now we're going to do it in both the head and the ch@@ est, kind of like "@@ common time@@ " or at the same time.
Yes, got it.
That means "@@ to fall in lo@@ ve" in International [@@ S@@ ign@@ ].
International [@@ S@@ ign@@ ], as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to demonstrate is this - please follow along with me again.
And now this.
This is "@@ coloniz@@ ation@@ " in AS@@ L@@ .
Now the third - please follow along again.
And again.
This is "@@ enlighten@@ ment@@ " in AS@@ L@@ .
So let's do all three together.
"F@@ all in lo@@ ve@@ ," "@@ coloniz@@ ation@@ " and "@@ enlighten@@ ment@@ ."
Good job, everyone.
Notice how all three signs are very similar, they all happen at the head and the ch@@ est, but they convey quite different mean@@ ings.
So it's amazing to see how AS@@ L is alive and thri@@ ving, just like music is.
However, in this day and age, we live in a very audi@@ o-@@ centr@@ ic world.
And just because AS@@ L has no sound to it, it automatically holds no social curr@@ ency.
We need to start thinking harder about what defin@@ es social currency and allow AS@@ L to develop its own form of currency - without sound.
And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't need to be dea@@ f to learn AS@@ L, nor do you have to be hearing to learn music.
AS@@ L is such a rich treas@@ ure that I'd like you to have the same experience.
And I'd like to invite you to open your ear@@ s, to open your eyes, take part in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you might just fall in love with us.
Thank you.
Den@@ ise Kah@@ l@@ er-@@ Bra@@ aten@@ : Hey, that's me.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: At the Har@@ b@@ our School in Hong K@@ ong, TED Sen@@ ior Fellow C@@ esar Har@@ ada teaches citizen science and invention to the next generation of environment@@ al@@ ists. He's moved his classroom into an industrial mega-@@ space where imagin@@ ative kids work with wood, metal, chemistry, biology, op@@ tics and, occasion@@ ally, power tools to create solutions to the threats facing the world's oceans. Ther@@ e, he in@@ stil@@ ls a universal lesson that his own parents taught him at a young age: "You can make a m@@ ess, but you have to clean up after your@@ self."
C@@ esar Har@@ ada: How I teach kids to love science.
When I was a kid, my parents would tell me, "You can make a m@@ ess, but you have to clean up after your@@ self."
So freedom came with responsibility.
But my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innoc@@ ence - or a bubble of ignor@@ ance, I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth.
And growing up, I found out that adults make a m@@ ess, and they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves.
F@@ ast forward, I am an adult now, and I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Har@@ b@@ our Scho@@ ol.
And it doesn't take too long before my students walk on a beach and stum@@ ble upon piles of tr@@ ash.
So as good citizens, we clean up the be@@ aches - and no, he is not drinking alcohol@@ , and if he is, I did not give it to him.
And so it's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them.
It's a horri@@ fying fact.
And in past decades, we've been taking those big ships out and those big ne@@ ts, and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope, and then we put this data onto a map.
But that takes forever, it's very expensive, and so it's quite risky to take those big boats out.
So with my students, ages six to 15, we've been dream@@ ing of invent@@ ing a better way.
So we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a worksho@@ p.
And so we started building this small work@@ ben@@ ch, with different heigh@@ ts, so even really short kids can participa@@ te.
And let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe.
Not really.
And so, back to plas@@ tic.
We collect this plastic and we gr@@ ind it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small because it breaks down.
And so this is how we work.
I let the imagin@@ ations of my students run wild.
And my job is to try to collect the best of each kid@@ 's idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work.
And so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits, we are going to collect only the data.
So we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot - so robots, kids get very excited.
And the next thing we do - we do what we call "@@ rapid proto@@ typ@@ ing."
We are so rapid at prototy@@ ping that the lunch is still in the lunch@@ box when we're hacking it.
And we h@@ ack table lam@@ ps and web@@ cam@@ s, into pl@@ umb@@ ing fix@@ tures and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water and through the plastic that we have there - and this is the image that we get in the robot.
So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor@@ , and the computer on board will process this image, and measure the size of each partic@@ le, so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water.
So we documented this invention step by step on a website for invent@@ ors called In@@ struc@@ tab@@ les, in the hope that somebody would make it even better.
What was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem, and bo@@ om - they are trying to immediately address it.
[@@ I can investigate my local problem@@ ] But my students in Hong Kong are hyper@@ connected kids.
And they watch the news, they watch the Internet, and they came across this image.
This was a child, probably under 10, cleaning up an oil spill bar@@ e-@@ han@@ ded, in the Sund@@ ar@@ ban@@ s, which is the world's largest man@@ gro@@ ve forest in Banglades@@ h.
So they were very shock@@ ed, because this is the water they drin@@ k, this is the water they ba@@ the in, this is the water they fish in - this is the place where they live.
And also you can see the water is bro@@ wn, the mud is brown and oil is bro@@ wn, so when everything is mixed up, it's really hard to see what's in the water.
But, there's a technology that's rather simple, that's called spec@@ tro@@ metr@@ y, that allows you see what's in the water.
So we built a rough prototype of a spec@@ tro@@ meter, and you can shine light through different subst@@ ances that produce different spectr@@ um@@ s, so that can help you identify what's in the water.
So we packed this prototype of a sensor@@ , and we shipped it to Banglades@@ h.
So what was cool about this project was that beyond addressing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help, remo@@ tely, other kids.
[@@ I can investigate a remote problem@@ ] So I was very comp@@ elled by doing the second experiments, and I wanted to take it even further - maybe addressing an even harder problem, and it's also closer to my heart.
So I'm half Japanese and half Fren@@ ch, and maybe you remember in 201@@ 1 there was a massive earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it trigger@@ ed several giant waves - they are called tsunami - and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan.
More than 14@@ ,000 people died in an inst@@ ant.
Also, it dam@@ aged the nuclear power plant of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hi@@ ma, the nuclear power plant just by the water.
And today, I read the reports and an average of 300 tons are le@@ aking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Oce@@ an.
And today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamin@@ ation of c@@ esi@@ um-@@ 13@@ 7.
If you go outside on the West Co@@ ast, you can measure Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it can look like most of the radio@@ activity has been washed away from the Japanese coas@@ t, and most of it is now - it looks like it's safe, it's blue.
Well, reality is a bit more complicated than this.
So I've been going to Fu@@ k@@ ush@@ ima every year since the accid@@ ent, and I measure independ@@ ently and with other scientists, on land, in the river - and this time we wanted to take the kids.
So of course we didn't take the kids, the parents wouldn't allow that to happen.
But every night we would report to "M@@ is@@ sion Contr@@ ol@@ " - different mas@@ ks they're wear@@ ing.
It could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they really did because they're going to have to live with radio@@ activity their whole life.
And so what we did with them is that we'd discuss the data we collected that day, and talk about where we should be going next - strategy, it@@ iner@@ ary, etc@@ ...
And to do this, we built a very rough topo@@ graph@@ ical map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
And so we built the elev@@ ation map, we s@@ prin@@ k@@ led pig@@ ments to represent real-time data for radio@@ activity, and we spr@@ ayed water to simulate the rain@@ fall.
And with this we could see that the radio@@ active dust was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system, and le@@ aking into the ocean.
So it was a rough estima@@ te.
But with this in mind, we organized this expedi@@ tion, which was the closest civil@@ ians have been to the nuclear power plant.
We are sa@@ iling 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant, and with the help of the local fisher@@ man, we are collecting sedi@@ ment from the se@@ ab@@ ed with a cus@@ tom sedi@@ ment sam@@ pl@@ er we've invented and built.
We pack the sedi@@ ment into small bag@@ s, we then dis@@ pat@@ ch them to hundreds of small bags that we send to different universi@@ ties, and we produce the map of the se@@ ab@@ ed radio@@ activity, especially in estu@@ aries where the fish will re@@ produc@@ e, and I will hope that we will have improved the safety of the local fisher@@ men and of your favorite sus@@ hi@@ .
You can see a progression here - we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been super exciting to work at these different scal@@ es, with also very simple, open-source technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustr@@ ating because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done.
We haven't even started to try to solve the problems.
And so I wonder if we should just take a leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
And so the classroom started to feel a little bit small, so we found an industrial site in Hong K@@ ong, and we turned it into the largest mega-@@ space focused on social and environmental impact.
It's in central Hong K@@ ong, and it's a place we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a bit of biology, a bit of op@@ tics, basically you can build pretty much everything there.
And its a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where kid@@ s' dreams can come true, with the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
Stu@@ dent@@ : Ac@@ celer@@ ation@@ ! Ac@@ celer@@ ation@@ !
C@@ esar Har@@ ada: We're asking questions such as, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energ@@ y?
For example.
Or, can we help the mobility of the aging population by transforming very standard wheel@@ chairs into cool, electric vehic@@ l@@ es?
So plastic, oil and radio@@ activity are horri@@ ble, horrible leg@@ aci@@ es, but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies.
We can no longer afford to shi@@ eld the kids from the ugly truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizen scientists, makers, dream@@ ers - we must prepare the next generation that cares about the environment and people, and that can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Desig@@ ner and architect N@@ er@@ i Ox@@ man is leading the search for ways in which digital fabric@@ ation technologies can interact with the biological world. Wor@@ king at the intersection of computational design, addi@@ tive manufactur@@ ing, materials engineering and synthetic biology, her lab is pione@@ ering a new age of sym@@ bios@@ is between micro@@ organisms, our bodies, our products and even our buildings.
N@@ er@@ i Ox@@ man: Design at the intersection of technology and biology.
Two twin dom@@ es, two radically opposed design cultur@@ es.
One is made of thousands of steel parts, the other of a single silk thre@@ ad.
One is syn@@ the@@ tic, the other organ@@ ic.
One is imposed on the environment, the other creates it.
One is designed for nature, the other is designed by her.
Michel@@ ang@@ elo said that when he looked at raw mar@@ ble, he saw a figure struggling to be free.
The ch@@ is@@ el was Michel@@ ang@@ elo@@ 's only tool.
But living things are not ch@@ is@@ el@@ ed.
They grow.
And in our smallest units of life, our cells, we carry all the information that's required for every other cell to function and to replic@@ ate.
To@@ ols also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial R@@ evolution, the world of design has been dominated by the rig@@ ors of manufacturing and mass production.
As@@ sem@@ bly lines have dic@@ tated a world made of parts, fr@@ aming the imagination of designers and architects who have been trained to think about their objects as assem@@ bli@@ es of discre@@ te parts with distinct func@@ tions.
But you don't find homo@@ genous material assem@@ bli@@ es in nature.
Take human skin, for example.
Our facial skin@@ s are thin with large por@@ es.
Our back skin@@ s are thick@@ er, with small por@@ es.
One acts mainly as fil@@ ter, the other mainly as barri@@ er, and yet it's the same skin@@ : no parts, no assem@@ bli@@ es.
It's a system that gradually vari@@ es its function@@ ality by var@@ ying el@@ as@@ tic@@ ity.
So here this is a split screen to represent my split world view, the split personality of every designer and architect operating today between the ch@@ is@@ el and the gene, between machine and organis@@ m, between assembly and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two world@@ view@@ s, my left brain and right brain, analysis and synthes@@ is, will play out on the two scre@@ ens behind me.
My work, at its simplest level, is about un@@ iting these two world@@ view@@ s, moving away from assembly and closer into growth.
You're probably asking your@@ selv@@ es: Why now?
Why was this not possible 10 or even five years ag@@ o?
We live in a very special time in history, a rare time, a time when the con@@ flu@@ ence of four fields is giving designers access to tools we've never had access to before.
These fields are computational design, allowing us to design complex forms with simple co@@ de@@ ; addi@@ tive manufactur@@ ing, letting us produce parts by adding material rather than car@@ ving it out@@ ; materials engineering, which lets us design the behavior of materials in high resolu@@ tion; and synthetic biology, enabling us to design new biological function@@ ality by ed@@ iting DNA.
And at the intersection of these four fiel@@ ds, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and hands of my students.
We design objects and products and structures and tools across scal@@ es, from the large-@@ scale, like this robotic arm with an 80@@ -@@ foot diameter reach with a vehic@@ ular base that will one day soon print entire buildings, to nanos@@ cal@@ e graphics made entirely of genetically engineered micro@@ organisms that g@@ low in the dark.
Here we've re@@ imagined the mas@@ h@@ rab@@ i@@ y@@ a, an arch@@ et@@ y@@ pe of ancient Arabic architecture, and created a screen where every aper@@ ture is uniquely sized to shape the form of light and heat moving through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a cape and skir@@ t - this was for a Paris fashion show with Ir@@ is van Her@@ pen - like a second skin that are made of a single part, sti@@ ff at the cont@@ our@@ s, flexible around the wa@@ ist.
Toge@@ ther with my long-term 3D printing collabor@@ ator S@@ trat@@ as@@ ys, we 3@@ D-@@ printed this cape and skir@@ t with no se@@ ams between the cells, and I'll show more objects like it.
This hel@@ met combin@@ es sti@@ ff and soft materials in 20-@@ micr@@ on resolu@@ tion.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CT scan@@ ner.
That designers have access to such high-@@ resolution analy@@ tic and synthetic tools, enables to design products that fit not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physi@@ ological make@@ up of our tissu@@ es.
Nex@@ t, we designed an acoustic chair, a chair that would be at once struc@@ tur@@ al, comfortable and would also absorb sound.
Professor Car@@ ter, my collabor@@ ator, and I turned to nature for inspir@@ ation, and by designing this ir@@ regular surface pattern, it becomes sound@@ -@@ absor@@ b@@ ent.
We printed its surface out of 44 different proper@@ ties, var@@ ying in rig@@ id@@ ity, op@@ ac@@ ity and color, correspon@@ ding to pressure points on the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, vari@@ es its function@@ ality not by adding another material or another assem@@ bly, but by continu@@ ously and delic@@ ately var@@ ying material proper@@ ty.
But is nature ide@@ al?
Are there no parts in nature@@ ?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother used to tell me stories from the He@@ bre@@ w B@@ ible, and one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what I care about.
As she re@@ coun@@ ts: "O@@ n the third day of Cre@@ ation, God comm@@ ands the Earth to grow a fru@@ it-@@ be@@ aring fruit tre@@ e."
For this first fruit tree, there was to be no differenti@@ ation between trun@@ k, bran@@ ches, leaves and fru@@ it.
The whole tree was a fru@@ it.
Instead, the land grew trees that have bar@@ k and s@@ tem@@ s and flow@@ ers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design be like if objects were made of a single par@@ t?
Would we return to a better state of cre@@ ation@@ ?"
So we looked for that bi@@ bl@@ ical material, that fru@@ it-@@ be@@ aring fruit tree kind of material, and we found it.
The secon@@ d-@@ most abundant bi@@ opol@@ y@@ mer on the planet is called ch@@ it@@ in, and some 100 million tons of it are produced every year by organisms such as shrim@@ ps, cr@@ ab@@ s, s@@ corp@@ ions and butter@@ fli@@ es.
We thought if we could tune its proper@@ ties, we could generate structures that are multi@@ functional out of a single part.
So that's what we did.
We called Leg@@ al Se@@ a@@ food - we ordered a bunch of shrimp sh@@ ell@@ s, we gr@@ in@@ ded them and we produced ch@@ it@@ os@@ an pas@@ te.
By var@@ ying chemical concentr@@ ations, we were able to achieve a wide array of properties - from dark, sti@@ ff and op@@ aqu@@ e, to light, soft and transpar@@ ent.
In order to print the structures in large scale, we built a robo@@ tically controlled extr@@ us@@ ion system with multiple no@@ zz@@ les.
The robot would vary material properties on the fly and create these 12-@@ foot@@ -long structures made of a single material, 100 percent recycl@@ able.
When the parts are ready, they're left to dry and find a form naturally upon contact with air.
So why are we still designing with plastic@@ s?
The air bubbles that were a by@@ product of the printing process were used to contain photos@@ yn@@ thetic micro@@ organisms that first appeared on our planet 3.@@ 5 billion year ago, as we learned yester@@ day.
Toge@@ ther with our collabor@@ ators at Harvard and MIT, we embedded bacteria that were genetically engineered to rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere and convert it into sug@@ ar.
For the first time, we were able to generate structures that would seam@@ lessly transition from be@@ am to mes@@ h, and if scaled even larger, to windo@@ ws.
A fru@@ it-@@ be@@ aring fruit tree.
Wor@@ king with an ancient material, one of the first life@@ forms on the planet, plenty of water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we were able to transform a structure made of shrimp sh@@ ells into an architecture that behav@@ es like a tree.
And here's the best part@@ : for objects designed to biodegrad@@ e, put them in the sea, and they will n@@ our@@ ish marine life@@ ; place them in soil, and they will help grow a tree.
The setting for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We looked for the possibility of creating life-@@ sustain@@ ing clothing for inter@@ planetary voy@@ ages.
To do that, we needed to contain bacteria and be able to control their flow@@ .
So like the peri@@ odi@@ c table, we came up with our own table of the element@@ s: new life@@ forms that were comput@@ ation@@ ally gro@@ wn, addi@@ tively manufac@@ tured and biolog@@ ically aug@@ mente@@ d.
I like to think of synthetic biology as liquid al@@ chem@@ y, only instead of trans@@ mu@@ ting precious metal@@ s, you're synthes@@ izing new biological function@@ ality inside very small channel@@ s.
It's called micro@@ fluid@@ ics.
We 3@@ D-@@ printed our own channels in order to control the flow of these liquid bacterial cultur@@ es.
In our first piece of clo@@ thing, we combined two micro@@ organisms.
The first is cy@@ an@@ ob@@ ac@@ teri@@ a.
It lives in our oceans and in fresh@@ water pon@@ ds.
And the second, E. coli@@ , the bacteri@@ um that inhab@@ its the human gu@@ t.
One conver@@ ts light into sugar, the other consum@@ es that sugar and produces bio@@ fuels useful for the built environment.
Now, these two micro@@ organisms never interact in nature.
In fact, they never met each other.
They've been here, engineered for the first time, to have a relationship inside a piece of clo@@ thing.
Think of it as evolution not by natural selec@@ tion, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that res@@ emb@@ les the dig@@ estive trac@@ t, that will help flow these bacteria and alter their function along the way.
We then started growing these channels on the human body, var@@ ying material properties according to the des@@ ired function@@ ality.
Where we wanted more photos@@ yn@@ thes@@ is, we would design more transparent channel@@ s.
This wear@@ able dig@@ estive system, when it's stret@@ ched end to end, sp@@ ans 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times as long as our small intest@@ ines.
And here it is for the first time unve@@ iled at TED - our first photos@@ yn@@ thetic wear@@ able, liquid channels g@@ lowing with life inside a wear@@ able clo@@ thing.
Thank you.
Mary S@@ hel@@ ley said, "We are un@@ fashion@@ ed creatures, but only half made up."
What if design could provide that other half@@ ?
What if we could create structures that would aug@@ ment living matter?
What if we could create personal micro@@ biom@@ es that would scan our skin@@ s, repair dam@@ aged tissue and sustain our bodi@@ es?
Think of this as a form of edi@@ ted biology.
This entire collec@@ tion, W@@ ander@@ ers, that was named after planets, was not to me really about fashion per se, but it provided an opportunity to specul@@ ate about the future of our race on our planet and beyon@@ d, to combine scientific insight with lots of mystery and to move away from the age of the machine to a new age of sym@@ bios@@ is between our bodies, the micro@@ organisms that we inhab@@ it, our products and even our buildings.
I call this material ecolog@@ y.
To do this, we always need to return back to nature.
By now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in lay@@ ers.
You also know that nature does@@ n't.
It grow@@ s. It adds with sophistica@@ tion.
This sil@@ k@@ worm co@@ co@@ on, for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside which to me@@ tam@@ orph@@ is@@ ize.
No addi@@ tive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistica@@ tion.
It does so by combin@@ ing not two materials, but two proteins in different concentr@@ ations.
One acts as the structure, the other is the glu@@ e, or the matr@@ ix, holding those fibers together.
And this happens across scales.
The sil@@ k@@ worm first attach@@ es itself to the environment - it creates a ten@@ s@@ ile structure - and it then starts spinning a com@@ press@@ ive co@@ co@@ on.
T@@ en@@ sion and com@@ press@@ ion, the two forces of life, manif@@ ested in a single material.
In order to better understand how this complex process works, we glu@@ ed a tiny earth magne@@ t to the head of a sil@@ k@@ wor@@ m, to the spin@@ ner@@ et.
We placed it inside a box with magnetic sensor@@ s, and that allowed us to create this 3-@@ dimensional point cloud and visualize the complex architecture of the sil@@ k@@ worm co@@ co@@ on.
However, when we placed the sil@@ k@@ worm on a flat pat@@ ch, not inside a box, we realized it would spin a flat co@@ co@@ on and it would still health@@ ily me@@ tam@@ orph@@ is@@ ize.
So we started designing different environment@@ s, different scaf@@ fol@@ ds, and we discovered that the shape, the com@@ position, the structure of the co@@ co@@ on, was directly informed by the environment.
Sil@@ k@@ worms are often bo@@ iled to death inside their co@@ co@@ ons, their silk un@@ r@@ avel@@ ed and used in the tex@@ tile industry.
We realized that designing these templ@@ ates allowed us to give shape to raw silk without bo@@ iling a single co@@ co@@ on.
They would health@@ ily me@@ tam@@ orph@@ is@@ ize, and we would be able to create these things.
So we scaled this process up to architectural scale.
We had a robot spin the templ@@ ate out of sil@@ k, and we placed it on our site.
We knew sil@@ k@@ worms mig@@ rated toward dar@@ ker and col@@ der areas, so we used a sun path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat on our structure.
We then created hol@@ es, or aper@@ tures, that would lock in the rays of light and heat, dis@@ tribut@@ ing those sil@@ k@@ worms on the structure.
We were ready to receive the cat@@ er@@ pillar@@ s.
We ordered 6,@@ 500 sil@@ k@@ worms from an online silk far@@ m.
And after four weeks of feed@@ ing, they were ready to spin with us.
We placed them carefully at the bottom ri@@ m of the scaf@@ fol@@ d, and as they spin they pu@@ pa@@ te, they mate, they lay eg@@ gs, and life begins all over again - just like us but much, much shor@@ ter.
B@@ uc@@ ky Ful@@ ler said that tension is the great integr@@ ity, and he was right.
As they spin biological silk over robo@@ tically sp@@ un sil@@ k, they give this entire pav@@ il@@ ion its integr@@ ity.
And over two to three weeks, 6,@@ 500 sil@@ k@@ worms spin 6,@@ 500 kilome@@ ters.
In a curious symmetr@@ y, this is also the length of the Sil@@ k Ro@@ ad.
The mo@@ th@@ s, after they hat@@ ch, produce 1.5 million eg@@ gs.
This could be used for 250 additional pav@@ il@@ ions for the future.
So here they are, the two world@@ view@@ s.
One sp@@ ins silk out of a robotic arm, the other fil@@ ls in the gap@@ s.
If the final fronti@@ er of design is to breathe life into the products and the buildings around us, to form a two-@@ material ecolog@@ y, then designers must un@@ ite these two world@@ view@@ s.
Which brings us back, of course, to the beginning.
Here's to a new age of design, a new age of creation, that takes us from a nature@@ -@@ inspired design to a design@@ -@@ inspired nature, and that demands of us for the first time that we mother nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What do you want to be when you grow up? Well, if you're not sure you want to do just one thing for the rest of your life, you're not alone. In this illumin@@ ating talk, writer and artist Emil@@ ie W@@ ap@@ nic@@ k describes the kind of people she calls "@@ multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ it@@ es" - who have a range of interests and jobs over one lifetime. Are you one?
Emil@@ ie W@@ ap@@ nick@@ : Why some of us don't have one true call@@ ing.
Ra@@ ise your hand if you've ever been asked the question "What do you want to be when you grow up@@ ?"
Now if you had to guess, how old would you say you were when you were first asked this question@@ ?
You can just hold up fing@@ ers.
Thre@@ e. Fi@@ ve. Thre@@ e. Fi@@ ve. Fi@@ ve. OK.
Now, raise your hand if the question has ever caused you any anxi@@ ety.
Any anxiety at all.
I'm someone who's never been able to answer the question "What do you want to be when you grow up@@ ?"
See, the problem wasn't that I didn't have any interests - it's that I had too many.
In high school, I liked English and math and art and I built websites and I played gu@@ itar in a pun@@ k band called Fr@@ ustr@@ ated Tele@@ phone Oper@@ ator.
Maybe you've heard of us.
This continued after high school, and at a certain point, I began to notice this pattern in myself where I would become interested in an area and I would dive in, become all-@@ consum@@ ed, and I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was, and then I would hit this point where I'd start to get bor@@ ed.
And usually I would try and persis@@ t anyway, because I had already devoted so much time and energy and sometimes money into this field.
But eventually this sense of bore@@ dom, this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this, this isn't challenging anymore - And I would have to let it go.
But then I would become interested in something else, something totally un@@ rel@@ ated, and I would dive into that, and become all-@@ consum@@ ed, and I'd be like, "Y@@ es! I found my thing@@ ," and then I would hit this point again where I'd start to get bor@@ ed.
And eventually, I would let it go.
But then I would discover something new and totally different, and I would dive into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxi@@ ety, for two reasons.
The first was that I wasn't sure how I was going to turn any of this into a career.
I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing, den@@ y all of my other passi@@ ons, and just res@@ ign myself to being bor@@ ed.
The other reason it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more person@@ al.
I worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything.
I worried that I was afraid of commit@@ ment, or that I was scat@@ ter@@ ed, or that I was self-@@ sab@@ ot@@ aging, afraid of my own success.
If you can relate to my story and to these feel@@ ings, I'd like you to ask yourself a question that I wish I had asked myself back then.
Ask yourself where you learned to ass@@ ign the meaning of wrong or ab@@ normal to doing many things.
I'll tell you where you learned it: you learned it from the culture.
We are first asked the question "What do you want to be when you grow up@@ ?"
When we're about five years old.
And the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that age.
It's considered an innoc@@ u@@ ous question, posed to little kids to el@@ ic@@ it cute repli@@ es, like, "I want to be an astronaut@@ ," or "I want to be a ball@@ er@@ in@@ a," or "I want to be a pir@@ ate@@ ."
In@@ ser@@ t Hal@@ lo@@ we@@ en costum@@ e here.
But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms - for instance, high school students might get asked what major they're going to pick in college.
And at some point, goes from being the cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night.
Why?
See, while this question inspi@@ res kids to dream about what they could be, it does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be.
In fact, it does just the opposi@@ te, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't re@@ ply with 20 different things, though well-@@ meaning adults will likely ch@@ uck@@ le and be like, "Oh, how cu@@ te, but you can't be a viol@@ in maker and a psycholog@@ ist.
You have to choos@@ e."
This is Dr. Bob Chil@@ ds - and he's a lu@@ th@@ ier and psycho@@ therap@@ ist.
And this is Amy N@@ g, a magazine editor turned illus@@ trat@@ or, entrepreneur@@ , teacher and creative direc@@ tor.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All they hear is that they're going to have to choos@@ e.
But it's more than that.
The notion of the narro@@ w@@ ly focused life is highly roman@@ tici@@ zed in our culture.
It's this idea of destin@@ y or the one true call@@ ing, the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do during our time on this ear@@ th, and you need to figure out what that thing is and devo@@ te your life to it.
But what if you're someone who isn't wired this way?
What if there are a lot of different subjects that you're curious about, and many different things you want to do?
Well, there is no room for someone like you in this frame@@ work.
And so you might feel alone.
You might feel like you don't have a purpose.
And you might feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
What you are is a multi@@ potenti@@ ali@@ te.
A multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite is someone with many interests and creative pursu@@ its.
It's a mouth@@ ful to say.
It might help if you break it up into three part@@ s: multi@@ , potential, and i@@ te.
You can also use one of the other terms that con@@ note the same idea, such as poly@@ math, the Ren@@ aiss@@ ance person.
Actually, during the Ren@@ aiss@@ ance period, it was considered the ideal to be well-@@ ver@@ sed in multiple disciplin@@ es.
Barbar@@ a S@@ her refer@@ s to us as "@@ scan@@ ner@@ s."
Use wh@@ ic@@ he@@ ver term you like, or invent your own.
I have to say I find it sort of fit@@ ting that as a community, we cannot agree on a single identity.
It's easy to see your multi@@ potenti@@ ality as a limit@@ ation or an af@@ flic@@ tion that you need to over@@ come.
But what I've learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are some tremendous streng@@ ths to being this way.
Here are three multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite super power@@ s.
One@@ : idea synthes@@ is.
That is, combin@@ ing two or more fields and creating something new at the intersec@@ tion.
S@@ ha H@@ wan@@ g and Rachel B@@ in@@ x drew from their shared interests in carto@@ graphy, data visualiz@@ ation, travel, mathematics and design, when they founded Mes@@ hu@@ .
Mes@@ h@@ u is a company that creates cus@@ tom geograph@@ ic@@ ally-@@ inspired jewel@@ ry.
S@@ ha and Rachel came up with this unique idea not des@@ pi@@ te, but because of their ec@@ lec@@ tic mix of skills and experiences.
Innov@@ ation happens at the intersec@@ tions.
That's where the new ideas come from.
And multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites, with all of their back@@ gr@@ ounds, are able to access a lot of these points of intersec@@ tion.
The second multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite super@@ power is rapid learning.
When multi@@ potenti@@ ali@@ tes become interested in something, we go hard.
We observe everything we can get our hands on.
We're also used to being begin@@ ners, because we've been begin@@ ners so many times in the past, and this means that we're less afraid of trying new things and stepping out of our comfort zon@@ es.
What's more, many skills are transfer@@ able across disciplin@@ es, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursu@@ e, so we're rarely starting from scrat@@ ch.
N@@ ora Dun@@ n is a full-time travel@@ er and fre@@ el@@ ance writ@@ er.
As a child concert pian@@ ist, she hon@@ ed an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest typ@@ ist she know@@ s.
Before becoming a writer, N@@ ora was a financial plan@@ ner.
She had to learn the fin@@ er mechanics of sales when she was starting her practice, and this skill now helps her write compelling pit@@ ches to editor@@ s.
It is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're drawn to, even if you end up qu@@ it@@ ting.
You might apply that knowledge in a different field enti@@ rely, in a way that you couldn't have anticipa@@ ted.
The third multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite super@@ power is adapt@@ abil@@ ity; that is, the ability to mor@@ ph into whatever you need to be in a given situation.
A@@ be C@@ aj@@ udo is sometimes a video direc@@ tor, sometimes a web designer, sometimes a Kick@@ star@@ ter consul@@ tant@@ , sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, appar@@ ently, James Bon@@ d.
He's valuable because he does good work.
He's even more valuable because he can take on various rol@@ es, depending on his cli@@ ent@@ s' needs.
F@@ ast Comp@@ any magazine identified adapt@@ ability as the single most important skill to develop in order to thri@@ ve in the 21st century.
The economic world is changing so quickly and un@@ predic@@ t@@ ably that it is the individuals and organizations that can pi@@ vo@@ t in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thri@@ ve.
Ide@@ a synthes@@ is, rapid learning and adapt@@ abil@@ ity: three skills that multi@@ potenti@@ ali@@ tes are very ad@@ ep@@ t at, and three skills that they might lose if press@@ ured to narrow their focus.
As a society, we have a v@@ ested interest in encouraging multi@@ potenti@@ ali@@ tes to be themselves.
We have a lot of complex, multi@@ dimensional problems in the world right now, and we need creative, out@@ -of-the-@@ box think@@ ers to tackle them.
Now, let's say that you are, in your heart, a special@@ ist.
You came out of the w@@ om@@ b knowing you wanted to be a pedi@@ atric neuros@@ ur@@ ge@@ on.
Don't worry - there's nothing wrong with you, either.
In fact, some of the best teams are com@@ pris@@ ed of a speci@@ alist and multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite paired together.
The speci@@ alist can dive in deep and implement ideas, while the multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite brings a bread@@ th of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful partner@@ ship.
But we should all be designing lives and care@@ ers that are al@@ igned with how we're wi@@ red.
And sad@@ ly, multi@@ potenti@@ ali@@ tes are largely being encouraged simply to be more like their speci@@ alist pe@@ ers.
So with that said, if there is one thing you take away from this talk, I hope that it is this: embrace your inner wir@@ ing, whatever that may be.
If you're a speci@@ alist at heart, then by all means, speci@@ aliz@@ e.
That is where you'll do your best work.
But to the multi@@ potenti@@ ali@@ tes in the room, including those of you who may have just realized in the last 12 minutes that you are one - to you I say: embrace your many passi@@ ons.
Fol@@ low your curiosity down those rab@@ bit hol@@ es.
Expl@@ ore your intersec@@ tions.
Em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing our inner wir@@ ing leads to a happi@@ er, more authentic life.
And perhaps more importantly - multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites, the world needs us.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: More than 40 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and that number is expected to increase dras@@ tically in the coming years. But no real progress has been made in the fight against the disease since its classi@@ fication more than 100 years ago. Sci@@ enti@@ st Samuel Coh@@ en shares a new breakthrough in Alzheimer's research from his lab as well as a message of hope. "@@ Alzheimer's is a diseas@@ e," Coh@@ en says, "@@ and we can cure it."
Samuel Coh@@ en: Alzheimer's is not normal aging — and we can cure it.
In the year 190@@ 1, a woman called Aug@@ us@@ te was taken to a medical as@@ yl@@ um in Frank@@ fur@@ t.
Aug@@ us@@ te was delus@@ ional and couldn't remember even the most basic details of her life.
Her doctor was called A@@ lo@@ is.
A@@ lo@@ is didn't know how to help Aug@@ us@@ te, but he watched over her un@@ til, sad@@ ly, she passed away in 190@@ 6.
After she died, A@@ lo@@ is performed an auto@@ p@@ sy and found strange pl@@ aqu@@ es and tang@@ les in Aug@@ us@@ te@@ 's brain - the likes of which he'd never seen before.
Now here's the even more striking thing.
If Aug@@ us@@ te had instead been alive today, we could offer her no more help than A@@ lo@@ is was able to 1@@ 14 years ago.
A@@ lo@@ is was Dr. A@@ lo@@ is Alzheimer.
And Aug@@ us@@ te De@@ ter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 190@@ 1, medicine has advanced great@@ ly.
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infec@@ tions, many treatments for cancer, anti@@ retrovir@@ als for HIV, stat@@ ins for heart disease and much more.
But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million people - which, by the way, will include many of you.
If you're hoping to live to be 85 or older, your chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one in two.
In other words, odds are you'll spend your golden years either suffering from Alzheimer's or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer@@ 's.
Al@@ ready in the United States alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One out of every five Medic@@ are dollars get spent on Alzheimer@@ 's.
It is today the most expensive disease, and costs are projected to increase fi@@ ve@@ fold by 2050, as the baby boom@@ er generation ages.
It may surprise you that, put simply, Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But we've done relatively little to address it.
Today, of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prev@@ ent, cure or even slow down.
We understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money into researching it.
The US government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer's despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer.
The lack of resources s@@ tem@@ s from a more fundamental cau@@ se: a lack of awar@@ eness.
Because here's what few people know but everyone shoul@@ d: Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the past 1@@ 14 years, everyone, including scientists, mistak@@ en@@ ly confused Alzheimer's with aging.
We thought that becoming sen@@ ile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old.
But we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
As well as trigger@@ ing severe loss of memory and mental abil@@ ities, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fat@@ al.
Remember Dr. Alzheim@@ er found strange pl@@ aqu@@ es and tang@@ les in Aug@@ us@@ te@@ 's brain a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about these.
Today we know they're made from protein molecul@@ es.
You can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami.
There are spots on the paper that are stick@@ y.
And when it folds correc@@ tly, these sticky bits end up on the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky bits are on the outside.
This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other, forming cl@@ um@@ ps that eventually become large pl@@ aqu@@ es and tang@@ les.
That's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the past 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this mal@@ function works.
There are many steps, and identi@@ fying which step to try to block is complex - like def@@ using a bomb@@ .
C@@ ut@@ ting one wire might do nothing.
C@@ ut@@ ting others might make the bomb explor@@ e.
We have to find the right step to bloc@@ k, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best.
But now we've got together a diverse group of people - medic@@ s, biolog@@ ists, genetic@@ ists, chem@@ ists, physic@@ ists, engineers and mathematici@@ ans.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease.
Now let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside of our lab has seen these yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in wor@@ ms.
So these are healthy wor@@ ms, and you can see they're moving around norm@@ ally.
These wor@@ ms, on the other hand, have protein molecules sticking together inside them - like humans with Alzheimer@@ 's.
And you can see they're clearly sick.
But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they're healthy, and they live a normal lifesp@@ an.
This is just an initial positive result, but research like this shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can c@@ ure.
After 1@@ 14 years of wait@@ ing, there's finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to finally beat Alzheimer@@ 's, we need help.
This isn't about scientists like me - it's about you.
We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we try, we can beat it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry, scientists and regul@@ ators.
That was essential for adv@@ ancing treatment for HIV in the late 198@@ 0s.
Today, we see that same drive to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victim@@ s, caring for their loved ones night and day, are often too wor@@ n out to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really is down to you.
Alzheimer's is@@ n't, for the most part, a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain is at risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like Aug@@ us@@ te, who can't create the change they need for themselves.
Hel@@ p speak up for them, and help demand a c@@ ure.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Did you know you can fall in love with anyone just by asking them 36 question@@ s? Mand@@ y L@@ en C@@ atr@@ on tried this experiment, it worked, and she wrote a viral article about it . But … is that real lo@@ ve? Did it las@@ t? And what@@ ’s the difference between falling in love and staying in lo@@ ve?
Mand@@ y L@@ en C@@ atr@@ on: F@@ alling in love is the easy part.
I published this article in the New York Times Moder@@ n Love column in January of this year.
"To F@@ all in Love With Any@@ one, Do Th@@ is."
And the article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laborator@@ y, and my own experience trying the study myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is fairly simple@@ : two strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions and then they stare into each other's eyes without speaking for four minutes.
So here are a couple of sample questions.
Number 12@@ : If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?
Number 2@@ 8@@ : When did you last cry in front of another person@@ ?
By your@@ self@@ ?
As you can see, they really do get more personal as they go along.
Number 30, I really like this one: Tell your partner what you like about them@@ ; be very honest this time, saying things you might not say to someone you just met.
So when I first came across this study a few years earlier, one detail really stuck out to me, and that was the rum@@ or that two of the participants had gotten married six months later, and they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremon@@ y.
So I was of course very skep@@ tical about this process of just manufacturing romantic love, but of course I was intrigu@@ ed.
And when I got the chance to try this study myself, with someone I knew but not particularly well, I wasn't expecting to fall in love.
But then we did, and - And I thought it made a good story, so I sent it to the Moder@@ n Love column a few months later.
Now, this was published in Jan@@ uary, and now it is Aug@@ ust, so I'm gu@@ essing that some of you are probably wondering, are we still together@@ ?
And the reason I think you might be wondering this is because I have been asked this question again and again and again for the past seven months.
And this question is really what I want to talk about today.
But let's come back to it.
So the week before the article came out, I was very nerv@@ ous.
I had been working on a book about love stories for the past few years, so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with romantic love on my blog@@ .
But a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most, and those were usually just my Facebook friends, and I figured my article in the New York Times would probably get a few thousand view@@ s.
And that felt like a lot of attention on a relatively new relationship.
But as it turned out, I had no idea.
So the article was published online on a Friday evening, and by Satur@@ day, this had happened to the traffic on my blog@@ .
And by Sund@@ ay, both the Today Show and Good Mor@@ ning America had cal@@ led.
Within a month, the article would receive over 8 million view@@ s, and I was, to say the least, under@@ prepared for this sort of attention.
It's one thing to work up the confidence to write honest@@ ly about your experiences with love, but it is another thing to discover that your love life has made international news - and to realize that people across the world are genu@@ inely invested in the status of your new relationship.
And when people called or e@@ mai@@ led, which they did every day for weeks, they always asked the same question first@@ : are you guys still together@@ ?
In fact, as I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search of my email in@@ box for the phrase "Are you still together@@ ?"
And several messages po@@ pped up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and friendly strangers like this one.
I did radio interviews and they ask@@ ed.
I even gave a talk, and one woman sh@@ ou@@ ted up to the stage, "H@@ ey Mand@@ y, wh@@ ere's your boy@@ friend@@ ?"
And I prom@@ pt@@ ly turned bright red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response.
The 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own.
In fact, the New York Times published a follow@@ -up article for Val@@ entin@@ e's Day, which feature@@ d read@@ ers' experiences of trying the study themselves, with var@@ ying degrees of success.
So my first impul@@ se in the face of all of this attention was to become very protective of my own relationship.
I said no to every request for the two of us to do a media appear@@ ance together.
I turned down TV intervie@@ ws, and I said no to every request for photos of the two us.
I think I was afraid that we would become in@@ adver@@ tent icon@@ s for the process of falling in love, a position I did not at all feel qualified for.
And I get it: people didn't just want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really work@@ ed: that is, if it was capable of producing love that would last, not just a fl@@ ing, but real love, sustainable love.
But this was a question I didn't feel capable of answer@@ ing.
My own relationship was only a few months old, and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place.
What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them?
If the answer was no, would it make the experience of doing these 36 questions any less worth@@ whi@@ le?
Dr. Arthur Ar@@ on first wrote about these questions in this study here in 1997, and here, the research@@ er's goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, they wanted to foster inter@@ personal clos@@ eness among college students, by using what Ar@@ on called "@@ sustain@@ ed, escal@@ ating, reciproc@@ al, person@@ alistic self-@@ dis@@ clos@@ ure@@ ."
S@@ ounds roman@@ tic, doesn't it?
But the study did work.
The participants did feel closer after doing it, and several subsequ@@ ent studies have also used Ar@@ on's fast friends proto@@ co@@ l as a way to quickly create trust and inti@@ macy between strang@@ ers.
They've used it between members of the police and members of community, and they've used it between people of oppos@@ ing political ide@@ ologi@@ es.
The original version of the story, the one that I tried last summer, that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contac@@ t, was refer@@ enced in this artic@@ le, but unfortunately it was never publ@@ ished.
So a few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college, and a student came up to me after@@ wards and he said, kind of sh@@ y@@ ly, "@@ So, I tried your study, and it didn't work."
He seemed a little my@@ sti@@ fied by this.
"You mean, you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with@@ ?" I ask@@ ed.
"W@@ ell@@ ..." He pa@@ used.
"I think she just wants to be friend@@ s."
"But did you become better friend@@ s?" I ask@@ ed.
"Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the stud@@ y?"
He no@@ d@@ ded.
"@@ So, then it work@@ ed@@ ," I said.
I don't think this is the answer he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for when it comes to love.
I first came across this study when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult break@@ up.
I had been in the relationship since I was 20, which was basically my entire adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him.
So I turned to science.
I resear@@ ched everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I think I was hoping that it might somehow in@@ ocul@@ ate me from heart@@ ach@@ e.
I don't know if I realized this at the time - I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing - but it seems really obvious in retrospec@@ t.
I hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love, I might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways.
I am more patient with love. I am more relax@@ ed.
I am more confident about asking for what I want.
But I can also see myself more clearly, and I can see that what I want is sometimes more than can reasonably be asked for.
What I want from love is a guarante@@ e, not just that I am loved today and that I will be loved tomorrow, but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love in@@ defini@@ tely.
Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee that people were really asking about when they wanted to know if we were still together.
So the story that the media told about the 36 questions was that there might be a short@@ cut to falling in love.
There might be a way to somehow mitig@@ ate some of the risk involved, and this is a very appe@@ aling story, because falling in love feels amazing, but it's also terri@@ f@@ ying.
The moment you admit to loving someone, you admit to having a lot to los@@ e, and it's true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly, which is also a mechanism for being known, and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from lo@@ ve: to be known, to be seen, to be understo@@ od.
But I think when it comes to love, we are too willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that as@@ ks, "Are you still together@@ ?"
And is content with a yes or no answer.
So rather than that question, I would propose we ask some more difficult questions, questions like@@ : How do you decide who deserves your love and who does not?
How do you stay in love when things get difficult, and how do you know when to just cut and run@@ ?
How do you live with the doubt that inevitably creep@@ s into every relationship, or even hard@@ er, how do you live with your partner@@ 's doub@@ t?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're an important start at having a more though@@ tful conversation about what it means to love some@@ one.
So, if you want it, the short version of the story of my relationship is this: a year ago, an ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ t@@ ance and I did a study designed to create romantic love, and we fell in love, and we are still together, and I am so gl@@ ad.
But falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love.
F@@ alling in love is the easy part.
So at the end of my artic@@ le, I wrote, "@@ Love didn't happen to us.
We're in love because we each made the choice to be@@ ."
And I cr@@ ing@@ e a little when I read that now, not because it isn't true, but because at the time, I really hadn't considered everything that was contained in that choice.
I didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice, and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice without knowing whether or not he will always choose me.
I want it to be enough to have asked and answered 36 questions, and to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun and to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America.
But what I have done instead is turn my relationship into the kind of myth I don't quite believe in.
And what I want, what perhaps I will spend my life want@@ ing, is for that myth to be true.
I want the happy ending im@@ pli@@ ed by the title to my artic@@ le, which is, incident@@ ally, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wri@@ te.
But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone, and the hope that he will choose to love me back, and it is terri@@ f@@ ying, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: D@@ us@@ tin Y@@ ell@@ in makes mes@@ mer@@ izing art@@ work that tells complex, my@@ th-@@ inspired stories. How did he develop his sty@@ le? In this dis@@ arm@@ ing talk, he shares the journey of an artist - starting from age 8 - and his idi@@ os@@ yn@@ cr@@ atic way of thinking and see@@ ing. Fol@@ low the path that leads him up to his latest major work .
D@@ us@@ tin Y@@ ell@@ in: A journey through the mind of an artist.
I was raised by les@@ bi@@ ans in the mountain@@ s, and I sort of came like a forest g@@ nome to New York City a while back.
Really mes@@ sed with my head, but I'll get into that later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wood box, and I buried a dollar bil@@ l, a pen and a for@@ k inside this box in Color@@ ado.
And I thought some strange human@@ o@@ ids or ali@@ ens in 500 years would find this box and learn about the way our species ex@@ changed ideas, maybe how we ate our spagh@@ et@@ ti.
I really didn't know.
Anyway, this is kind of funny, because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
Now, at some point I was in Hawai@@ i - I like to hi@@ ke and sur@@ f and do all that weird stuff, and I was making a col@@ l@@ age for my ma.
And I took a dictionary and I ri@@ pped it up, and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid, and I poured res@@ in all over it and a bee got stuc@@ k.
Now, she's afraid of bees and she's all@@ er@@ gic to them, so I poured more res@@ in on the can@@ vas, thinking I could hide it or something.
Instead, the opposite happen@@ ed: It sort of created a magnific@@ ation, like a magni@@ fying glass, on the dictionary text.
So what did I do? I built more boxes.
This time, I started putting electron@@ ics, fro@@ gs, strange bottles I'd find in the street - anything I could find - because I was always finding things my whole life, and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realiz@@ ed: Hol@@ y mol@@ y, I can draw in spac@@ e!
I can make free-@@ floating lines, like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scen@@ e.
So I took the objects out, and I created my own tax@@ on@@ omy of invented speci@@ men@@ s.
First, bo@@ tan@@ ical - which you can kind of get a sense of.
Then I made some weird insects and creatures.
It was really fun@@ ; I was just drawing on the layers of res@@ in.
And it was cool, because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff, I was making some money, I could take my girl@@ friend for din@@ ner, and like, go to S@@ iz@@ z@@ ler. It was some good sh@@ it, man.
At some point, I got up to the human form, life-@@ size res@@ in sculptures with drawings of humans inside the lay@@ ers.
This was great, except for one thing: I was going to die.
I didn't know what to do, because the res@@ in was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried using glass.
I started drawing on the layers of glass, almost like if you drew on a window, then you put another window, and another window, and you had all these windows together that made a three-dimensional com@@ position.
And this really worked, because I could stop using the res@@ in.
So I did this for years, which cul@@ min@@ ated in a very large work, which I call "The Tri@@ pt@@ y@@ ch@@ ."
"The Tri@@ pt@@ y@@ ch@@ " was largely inspired by Hi@@ er@@ on@@ y@@ mu@@ s Bos@@ ch@@ 's "@@ [@@ The@@ ] Gar@@ den of Earth@@ ly Del@@ ight@@ s," which is a painting in the [@@ Muse@@ o del@@ ] Pr@@ ado in S@@ pain.
Do you guys know this paint@@ ing? Go@@ od, it's a cool painting.
It's kind of ahead of its time, they say.
So, "The Tri@@ pt@@ y@@ ch@@ ." I'll walk you through this piece.
It weighs 24@@ ,000 pounds.
It's 18 feet long.
It's double-@@ sid@@ ed, so it's 36 feet of com@@ position. It's kind of weir@@ d.
Well, that's the blood foun@@ tain@@ .
To the left, you have Jesus and the loc@@ us@@ ts.
There's a cave where all these anim@@ al-@@ headed creatures travel between two world@@ s.
They go from the represent@@ ational world, to this analog@@ -@@ mesh under@@ world, where they're hid@@ ing.
This is where the anim@@ al-@@ headed creatures are by the ligh@@ thou@@ se, and they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean.
The ocean is made up of thousands of elem@@ ents.
This is a bird go@@ d tied up to a batt@@ les@@ hi@@ p. Billy Graham is in the ocean@@ ; the H@@ oriz@@ on from the oil sp@@ ill@@ ; Wal@@ do; Osama B@@ in Lad@@ en's shelter - there's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard, in the ocean.
Anyway, this is a lady creature.
She's coming out of the ocean, and she's sp@@ itting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand.
Her hands are like scal@@ es, and she has the myth@@ ological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance.
So that's one side of "The Tri@@ pt@@ y@@ ch@@ ." It's a little narrative thing.
That's her hand that she's sp@@ itting into.
And then, when you go to the other side, she has like a trun@@ k, like a bir@@ d's be@@ ak, and she's sp@@ itting clouds out of her trun@@ k.
Then she has an 18@@ -@@ foot@@ -long ser@@ p@@ ent@@ 's tail that connects "The Tri@@ pt@@ y@@ ch@@ ."
Anyway, her tail cat@@ ches on fire from the back of the volcan@@ o.
I don't know why that happened.
That happens, you know.
Her tail termin@@ ates in a cy@@ clo@@ p@@ tic ey@@ eb@@ all, made out of 198@@ 6 terrorist cards. Have you guys seen thos@@ e?
They were made in the 198@@ 0@@ 's, they're like baseball cards of terror@@ ists.
W@@ ay ahead of their time.
That will bring you to my latest project.
I'm in the middle of two projec@@ ts: One@@ 's called "P@@ sy@@ cho@@ geo@@ grap@@ hi@@ es."
It's about a six@@ -year project to make 100 of these humans.
Each one is an archi@@ ve of our culture, through our ri@@ p@@ ped@@ -up media and matter, whether it's encyclo@@ pedi@@ as or diction@@ aries or magaz@@ ines.
But each one acts as a sort of an archi@@ ve in the shape of a human, and they travel in groups of 20, 4, or 12 at a time.
They're like cells - they come together, they divid@@ e.
And you kind of walk through them. It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a 3@@ ,000-@@ pound microscope slide with a human stuck inside.
This one has a little cave in his ch@@ est.
That's his head@@ ; there's the ch@@ est, you can kind of see the beginning.
I'm going to go down the body for you: There's a water@@ fall coming out of his ch@@ est, covering his pen@@ is - or not-@@ pen@@ is, or whatever it is, a kind of and@@ rog@@ yn@@ ous thing.
I'll take you quickly through these works, because I can't explain them for too long.
There are the lay@@ ers, you can kind of see it.
That's a body getting split in half.
This one has two heads, and it's communicating between the two heads.
You can see the p@@ ills coming out, going into one head from this weird statu@@ e.
There's a little forest scene inside the chest cav@@ ity.
Can you see that?
Anyway, this tal@@ k@@ 's all about these box@@ es, like the boxes we're in.
This box we're in, the solar system is a box.
This brings you to my latest box.
It's a br@@ ick box. It's called P@@ ion@@ e@@ er Wor@@ ks.
In@@ side of this box is a physic@@ ist, a neuros@@ cientist@@ , a pa@@ inter@@ , a musici@@ an, a writer, a radio station, a museum, a school, a publishing arm to dissemin@@ ate all the content we make there into the world@@ ; a garden.
We shake this box up, and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles.
And I think that's the way you change the world.
You redefine your ins@@ ides and the box that you're living in.
And you come together to realize that we're all in this together, that this delus@@ ion of difference - this idea of countries, of borders, of religion - doesn't work.
We're all really made up of the same stuff, in the same box.
And if we don't start ex@@ changing that stuff swe@@ et@@ ly and nic@@ ely, we're all going to die real soon.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: S@@ wal@@ lowing p@@ ills to get medication is a qu@@ ick, pain@@ less and often not entirely effective way of treating disease. A potentially better way? L@@ as@@ ers. In this passionate talk, TED Fellow Pati@@ ence M@@ th@@ un@@ zi explains her idea to use las@@ ers to deliver drugs directly to cells infected with HIV. It's early days yet, but could a cure be on the horizon@@ ?
Pati@@ ence M@@ th@@ un@@ z@@ i: Could we cure HIV with las@@ ers?
What do you do when you have a head@@ ache@@ ?
You swal@@ low an aspir@@ in.
But for this p@@ ill to get to your head, where the pain is, it goes through your stomach@@ , intest@@ ines and various other organs first.
S@@ wal@@ lowing p@@ ills is the most effective and pain@@ less way of delivering any medication in the body.
The down@@ side, though, is that swal@@ lowing any medication leads to its dilu@@ tion.
And this is a big problem, particularly in HIV patients.
When they take their anti-@@ HIV drugs, these drugs are good for low@@ ering the virus in the blood, and increasing the CD@@ 4 cell coun@@ ts.
But they are also no@@ tor@@ ious for their adver@@ se side effects, but mostly bad, because they get dilu@@ ted by the time they get to the blood, and worse, by the time they get to the sites where it matters mos@@ t: within the HIV viral reser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s.
These areas in the body - such as the ly@@ mp@@ h no@@ des, the nervous system, as well as the lun@@ gs - where the virus is sleep@@ ing, and will not read@@ ily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti-@@ HIV drugs therap@@ y.
However, upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of therap@@ y, the virus can a@@ wake and infec@@ t new cells in the blood.
Now, all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment, which is a life@@ -long treatment that must be swal@@ lowed by patients.
One day, I sat and thought, "Can we deliver anti-@@ HIV directly within its reser@@ vo@@ ir sites, without the risk of drug dilu@@ tion@@ ?"
As a laser scientist, the answer was just before my ey@@ es: L@@ as@@ ers, of course.
If they can be used for d@@ enti@@ str@@ y, for diab@@ e@@ tic w@@ ound@@ -@@ healing and surgery, they can be used for anything imagin@@ able, including transport@@ ing drugs into cells.
As a matter of fact, we are currently using laser pul@@ ses to po@@ ke or drill extremely tiny hol@@ es, which open and close almost immediately in HIV-@@ infected cells, in order to deliver drugs within them.
"How is that possible@@ ?" you may ask.
Well, we shine a very powerful but super-@@ tiny laser be@@ am onto the membran@@ e of HIV-@@ infected cells while these cells are immer@@ sed in liquid contain@@ ing the drug@@ .
The laser pi@@ er@@ ces the cell, while the cell swal@@ lows the drug in a matter of micros@@ econ@@ ds.
Before you even know it, the induc@@ ed hole becomes immediately re@@ pa@@ ire@@ d.
Now, we are currently testing this technology in test tubes or in Petr@@ i dish@@ es, but the goal is to get this technology in the human body, apply it in the human body.
"How is that possible@@ ?" you may ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three-@@ headed device.
Using the first head, which is our las@@ er, we will make an incis@@ ion in the site of infec@@ tion.
Using the second head, which is a camera, we me@@ and@@ er to the site of infec@@ tion.
Finally, using a third head, which is a drug@@ -@@ spreading s@@ prin@@ k@@ ler, we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infec@@ tion, while the laser is again used to po@@ ke those cells open.
Well, this might not seem like much right now.
But one day, if successful, this technology can lead to complete eradic@@ ation of HIV in the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is every HIV research@@ er's dream - in our case, a cure lead by las@@ ers.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: IS@@ I@@ S, He@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h, Ham@@ as. These three very different groups are known for violence — but that’s only a portion of what they do, says policy analy@@ st B@@ ene@@ det@@ ta Ber@@ ti. They also attempt to win over populations with social work@@ : setting up schools and hospitals, offering safety and security, and filling the gaps left by weak govern@@ ments. Under@@ standing the broader work of these groups suggests new strategies for ending the violence.
B@@ ene@@ det@@ ta Ber@@ ti@@ : The surprising way groups like IS@@ I@@ S stay in power.
For the past decade, I've been studying non-@@ state armed group@@ s: armed organizations like terror@@ ists, in@@ surg@@ ents or mil@@ iti@@ as.
I document what these groups do when they're not shoot@@ ing.
My goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confront@@ ation.
I work in the field, in the policy world and in the libr@@ ary.
Under@@ standing non-@@ state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict, because war has changed.
It used to be a cont@@ est between states.
No longer.
It is now a conflict between states and non-@@ state ac@@ tors.
For example, of the 2@@ 16 peace agre@@ ements signed between 197@@ 5 and 2011, 19@@ 6 of them were between a state and a non-@@ state ac@@ tor.
So we need to understand these group@@ s; we need to either engage them or defe@@ at them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful.
So how do we do that?
We need to know what makes these organizations tic@@ k.
We know a lot about how they figh@@ t, why they figh@@ t, but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not figh@@ ting.
Yet, armed struggle and un@@ armed politics are rel@@ ated.
It is all part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, let alone defe@@ at them, if we don't have the full picture.
And armed groups today are complex organizations.
Take the Leban@@ ese He@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h, known for its violent confront@@ ation against Israel.
But since its creation in the early 198@@ 0s, He@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h has also set up a political party, a soci@@ al-@@ service network, and a military appar@@ at@@ us.
Similarly, the Palestinian Ham@@ as, known for its suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaz@@ a S@@ trip since 2007.
So these groups do way more than just shoo@@ t.
They multi-@@ task.
They set up complex communication machines - radio st@@ ations, TV channel@@ s, Internet websites and social media strategi@@ es.
And up here, you have the IS@@ I@@ S magazine, printed in English and published to recru@@ it.
Ar@@ med groups also invest in complex fund@@ -@@ raising - not loo@@ ting, but setting up prof@@ itable business@@ es; for example, construction companies.
Now, these activities are key@@ s.
They allow these groups to increase their streng@@ th, increase their fund@@ s, to better recru@@ it and to build their br@@ and.
Ar@@ med groups also do something else@@ : they build stronger bon@@ ds with the population by investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they set up voc@@ ation@@ al-@@ training programs or micro-@@ loan programs.
He@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h offers all of these services and more.
Ar@@ med groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not provid@@ ing: safety and security.
The initial rise of the Taliban in war@@ -@@ tor@@ n Afghanistan, or even the beginning of the as@@ cent of IS@@ I@@ S, can be understood also by looking at these group@@ s' efforts to provide security.
Now, unfortunately, in these cases, the pro@@ vision of security came at an un@@ bear@@ ably high price for the population.
But in general, providing social services fil@@ ls a g@@ ap, a governance gap left by the government, and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power.
For example, the 2006 elec@@ tor@@ al vic@@ tory of the Palestinian Ham@@ as cannot be understood without acknowled@@ ging the group@@ 's social work.
Now, this is a really complex picture, yet in the West, when we look at armed groups, we only think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand these group@@ s' streng@@ th, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hy@@ brid@@ .
They rise because they fill a gap left by the government, and they emerge to be both armed and politic@@ al, engage in violent struggle and provide govern@@ ance.
And the more these organizations are complex and sophistica@@ ted, the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state.
Now, what do you call a group like He@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h?
They run part of a territor@@ y, they ad@@ minister all their func@@ tions, they pick up the gar@@ b@@ age, they run the se@@ wage system.
Is this a state@@ ? Is it a re@@ bel group@@ ?
Or maybe something else, something different and new@@ ?
And what about IS@@ IS@@ ?
The lines are blur@@ red.
We live in a world of states, non-@@ states, and in-@@ between, and the more states are wea@@ k, like in the Middle East today, the more non-@@ state actors step in and fill that g@@ ap.
This matters for governments, because to counter these groups, they will have to invest more in non-@@ military tools.
F@@ illing that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This also matters very much for peace@@ making and peace@@ building.
If we better understand armed groups, we will better know what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to non@@ violence.
So in this new cont@@ est between states and non-@@ states, military power can win some batt@@ les, but it will not give us peace nor st@@ ability.
To achieve these objec@@ tives, what we need is a long-term investment in filling that security g@@ ap, in filling that governance gap that allowed these groups to thri@@ ve in the first place.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When writer R@@ ox@@ ane G@@ ay dub@@ bed herself a "@@ bad femin@@ ist@@ ," she was making a jo@@ ke, acknowled@@ ging that she couldn't possibly live up to the demands for perfec@@ tion of the femin@@ ist movement. But she's realized that the joke ran@@ g hol@@ low. In a though@@ tful and provoc@@ ative talk, she asks us to embrace all flav@@ ors of femin@@ ism - and make the small choices that, en mas@@ se, might lead to actual change.
R@@ ox@@ ane Gay@@ : Con@@ f@@ ess@@ ions of a bad femin@@ ist.
I am failing as a woman, I am failing as a femin@@ ist.
I have passionate opin@@ ions about gender equal@@ ity, but I worry that to freely accept the label of "@@ femin@@ ist@@ ," would not be fair to good femin@@ ists.
I'm a femin@@ ist, but I'm a rather bad one.
Oh, so I call myself a B@@ ad Femin@@ ist.
Or at least, I wrote an ess@@ ay, and then I wrote a book called "B@@ ad Femin@@ ist@@ ," and then in intervie@@ ws, people started calling me The B@@ ad Femin@@ ist.
So, what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself and a will@@ ful provoc@@ ation, has become a thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was youn@@ ger, mostly in my te@@ ens and 20@@ s, I had strange ideas about femin@@ ists as hair@@ y, angr@@ y, man-@@ h@@ ating, sex@@ -@@ h@@ ating women - as if those are bad things.
These days, I look at how women are treated the world over, and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But back then, I worried about the tone people used when suggesting I might be a femin@@ ist.
The femin@@ ist label was an ac@@ cus@@ ation, it was an "F@@ " word, and not a nice one.
I was labeled a woman who doesn't play by the rules, who expec@@ ts too much, who thinks far too highly of myself, by dar@@ ing to believe I'm equal - - superior to a man.
You don't want to be that re@@ bel woman, until you realize that you very much are that woman, and cannot imagine being anyone else.
As I got older, I began to accept that I am, indeed, a femin@@ ist, and a proud one.
I hold certain truths to be self-@@ evid@@ ent@@ : Women are equal to men.
We deserve equal pay for equal work.
We have the right to move through the world as we choos@@ e, free from har@@ ass@@ ment or violence.
We have the right to easy, affordable access to birth control, and reproductive services.
We have the right to make choices about our bodies, free from legisl@@ ative o@@ vers@@ ight or ev@@ angel@@ ical doc@@ tr@@ ine.
We have the right to respec@@ t.
There's more.
When we talk about the needs of women, we have to consider the other identi@@ ties we inhab@@ it.
We are not just women.
We are people with different bodies, gender express@@ ions, faith@@ s, sexu@@ ali@@ ties, class back@@ gr@@ ounds, abil@@ ities, and so much more.
We need to take into account these differences and how they affect us, as much as we account for what we have in common.
Without this kind of inclus@@ ion, our femin@@ ism is nothing.
I hold these truths to be self-@@ evid@@ ent, but let me be clear@@ : I'm a m@@ ess.
I am full of contradic@@ tions.
There are many ways in which I'm doing femin@@ ism wrong.
I have another confess@@ ion.
When I drive to work, I listen to th@@ ug@@ g@@ ish rap at a very loud volume. Even though the ly@@ ric@@ s are degrad@@ ing to women - these ly@@ ric@@ s off@@ end me to my core - the classic Y@@ in Y@@ ang T@@ win@@ s song "S@@ al@@ t Shak@@ er@@ " - it is amazing.
"M@@ ake it work with your we@@ t t-@@ shir@@ t.
Bit@@ ch, you gotta shake it '@@ til your cam@@ el starts to hur@@ t@@ !"
Think about it.
Po@@ e@@ try, right?
I am utterly mor@@ ti@@ fied by my music choices.
I firmly believe in man work, which is anything I don't want to do, including - - all domestic tas@@ ks, but al@@ so: bug kill@@ ing, trash re@@ mov@@ al, la@@ wn care and vehicle mainten@@ ance.
I want no part of any of that.
P@@ ink is my favorite color.
I enjoy fashion magaz@@ ines and pretty things.
I watch "The B@@ ach@@ el@@ or@@ " and romantic comedi@@ es, and I have absur@@ d fantas@@ ies about fair@@ y tal@@ es coming true.
Some of my trans@@ gress@@ ions are more fl@@ agr@@ ant.
If a woman wants to take her husband@@ 's name, that is her choice, and it is not my place to jud@@ ge.
If a woman choos@@ es to stay home to raise her children, I embrace that choice, too.
The problem is not that she makes herself econom@@ ically vulnerable in that cho@@ ic@@ e; the problem is that our society is set up to make women econom@@ ically vulnerable when they choos@@ e.
Let's deal with that.
I rejec@@ t the mainstream femin@@ ism that has histor@@ ically ignored or def@@ lec@@ ted the needs of women of color, work@@ ing-@@ class women, que@@ er women and trans@@ gender women, in favor of supporting white, midd@@ le@@ - and up@@ per-@@ class straight women.
L@@ isten, if that's good femin@@ ism - I am a very bad femin@@ ist.
There is also this: As a femin@@ ist, I feel a lot of press@@ ure.
We have this tendency to put visible femin@@ ists on a ped@@ est@@ al.
We expect them to pose perfec@@ tly.
When they disap@@ point us, we g@@ le@@ eful@@ ly knock them from the very ped@@ est@@ al we put them on.
Like I said, I am a mess - consider me knocked off that ped@@ est@@ al before you ever try to put me up there.
Too many women, particularly ground@@ breaking women and industry leaders, are afraid to be labeled as femin@@ ists.
They're afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a femin@@ ist@@ ," for fear of what that label means, for fear of being unable to live up to un@@ realistic expect@@ ations.
T@@ ake, for example, B@@ ey@@ on@@ cé@@ , or as I call her, The God@@ d@@ ess.
She has emerg@@ ed, in recent years, as a visible femin@@ ist.
At the 201@@ 4 M@@ TV Vide@@ o Music A@@ wards, she performed in front of the word "@@ femin@@ ist@@ " 10 feet high.
It was a glorious spectac@@ le to see this pop star open@@ ly embracing femin@@ ism and letting young women and men know that being a femin@@ ist is something to celebr@@ ate.
As the moment fad@@ ed, cultural cri@@ tics began end@@ lessly deb@@ ating whether or not B@@ ey@@ on@@ c@@ é was, indeed, a femin@@ ist.
They grad@@ ed her femin@@ ism, instead of simply taking a gro@@ wn, accomplished woman at her word.
We demand perfec@@ tion from femin@@ ists, because we are still fighting for so much, we want so much, we need so damn much.
We go far beyond reason@@ able, construc@@ tive critic@@ ism, to dissec@@ ting any given woman's femin@@ ism, te@@ aring it apart until there's nothing left.
We do not need to do that.
B@@ ad femin@@ ism - or really, more inclusive femin@@ ism - is a starting point.
But what happens next?
We go from acknowled@@ ging our im@@ perfec@@ tions to account@@ ability, or walking the walk, and being a little bit brav@@ e.
If I listen to degrad@@ ing music, I am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy to contribute a limit@@ less suppl@@ y.
These artists are not going to change how they talk about women in their songs until we demand that change by affecting their bottom line.
Cer@@ tain@@ ly, it is difficult.
Why must it be so cat@@ ch@@ y?
It's hard to make the better choice, and it is so easy to justify a less@@ er one.
But - when I justify bad choices, I make it harder for women to achieve equal@@ ity, the equality that we all deser@@ ve, and I need to own that.
I think of my ni@@ ec@@ es, ages three and four.
They are gorgeous and head@@ strong, brilliant girls, who are a whole lot of brav@@ e.
I want them to thri@@ ve in a world where they are valu@@ ed for the powerful creatures they are.
I think of them, and suddenly, the better choice becomes far easier to make.
We can all make better choices.
We can change the channel when a television show tre@@ ats sexual violence against women like sport@@ , G@@ ame of Th@@ r@@ ones.
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as nothing.
We can spend our box office dollars elsewhere when movies don't treat women as anything more than decor@@ ative objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where the athletes treat their partners like pun@@ ching bag@@ s.
In other ways, men - and especially straight white men - can say, "No, I will not publish with your magazine, or participate in your project, or otherwise work with you, until you include a fair number of women, both as participants and decision mak@@ ers.
I won't work with you until your public@@ ation, or your organization, is more inclusive of all kinds of differ@@ ence."
Those of us who are under@@ represented and invited to participate in such projects, can also decline to be included until more of us are invited through the glass ceil@@ ing, and we are tok@@ ens no more.
Without these effor@@ ts, without taking these stand@@ s, our accomplish@@ ments are going to mean very little.
We can commit these small acts of br@@ aver@@ y and hope that our choices trick@@ le up@@ ward to the people in power - editor@@ s, movie and music produ@@ cer@@ s, CE@@ Os, law@@ makers - the people who can make bigger, brav@@ er choices to create l@@ ast@@ ing, meaningful change.
We can also bol@@ dly claim our femin@@ ism - good, bad, or anywhere in between.
The last line of my book "B@@ ad Femin@@ ist@@ " says, "I would rather be a bad femin@@ ist than no femin@@ ist at all@@ ."
This is true for so many reasons, but first and for@@ em@@ os@@ t, I say this because once upon a time, my voice was stolen from me, and femin@@ ism helped me to get my voice back.
There was an incid@@ ent.
I call it an incident so I can carry the burden of what happened.
Some boys broke me, when I was so young, I did not know what boys can do to break a girl.
They treated me like I was nothing.
I began to believe I was nothing.
They st@@ ole my voice, and in the after, I did not dare to believe that anything I might say could matter.
But - I had writing.
And there, I wrote myself back together.
I wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of women who might understand a story like mine, and women who looked like me, and understood what it was like to move through the world with brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me I was not nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond meas@@ ure.
Through writing and femin@@ ism, I also found that if I was a little bit brav@@ e, another woman might hear me and see me and recognize that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I hold the power to accomplish anything.
And in my other, I hold the hum@@ bling reality that I am just one woman.
I am a bad femin@@ ist, I am a good woman, I am trying to become better in how I think, and what I say, and what I do, without abandon@@ ing everything that makes me human.
I hope that we can all do the same.
I hope that we can all be a little bit brav@@ e, when we most need such br@@ aver@@ y.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Dec@@ ades ago, few pediatr@@ ici@@ ans had heard of autism. In 197@@ 5, 1 in 5,000 kids was estimated to have it. Today, 1 in 6@@ 8 is on the autism spectrum. What caused this ste@@ ep ris@@ e? Steve Sil@@ ber@@ man points to “@@ a perfect storm of autism awar@@ en@@ ess@@ ” — a pair of psychologists with an accepting view, an unexpected pop culture moment and a new clinical test. But to really understand, we have to go back further to an Aus@@ tri@@ an doctor by the name of Hans As@@ per@@ ger, who published a pione@@ ering paper in 194@@ 4. Because it was buried in time, autism has been sh@@ rou@@ ded in mis@@ understanding ever since.
Steve Sil@@ ber@@ man: The forgotten history of autism.
Just after Christmas last year, 13@@ 2 kids in California got the meas@@ les by either visiting Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land or being exposed to someone who'd been there.
The virus then ho@@ pped the Canadian bord@@ er, infec@@ ting more than 100 children in Que@@ bec@@ .
One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that meas@@ les, which can be fatal to a child with a weak@@ ened immune system, is one of the most easily prevent@@ able diseases in the world.
An effective vaccine against it has been available for more than half a century, but many of the kids involved in the Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land outbreak had not been vaccin@@ ated because their parents were afraid of something al@@ leg@@ edly even wor@@ se: autism.
But wait - wasn't the paper that spar@@ ked the controvers@@ y about autism and vaccines deb@@ un@@ k@@ ed, re@@ trac@@ ted, and bran@@ ded a deliber@@ ate fraud by the British Medical Journ@@ al?
Don't most sci@@ ence@@ -@@ sav@@ vy people know that the theory that vaccines cause autism is B.@@ S.@@ ?
I think most of you do, but millions of parents worldwide continue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered an incredibly rare condition.
The few psychologists and pediatr@@ ici@@ ans who'd even heard of it figured they would get through their entire care@@ ers without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates remained stable at just three or four children in 10@@ ,000.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to sky@@ rock@@ et.
Fund@@ raising organizations like A@@ uti@@ s@@ m Spe@@ aks routinely refer to autism as an epidem@@ ic, as if you could catch it from another kid at Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land.
So what's going on?
If it isn't vaccin@@ es, what is it?
If you ask the folks down at the Cent@@ ers for Dis@@ ease Contr@@ ol in Atl@@ anta what's going on, they tend to rely on phras@@ es like "@@ broad@@ ened diagnostic crit@@ eri@@ a" and "@@ better case fin@@ d@@ ing" to explain these rising numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't do much to all@@ ay the fears of a young mother who is searching her two-@@ year-ol@@ d's face for eye contac@@ t.
If the diagnostic crit@@ eria had to be broad@@ en@@ ed, why were they so narrow in the first plac@@ e?
Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the 199@@ 0@@ s?
Five years ago, I decided to try to un@@ cover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow and ca@@ uti@@ ous progress of science than it does with the seduc@@ tive power of storytell@@ ing.
For most of the 20th century, cl@@ inici@@ ans told one story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be wrong, and the consequences of it are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second, more accurate story of autism which had been lost and forgotten in obs@@ cure cor@@ ners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go next.
The first story starts with a child psychiatr@@ ist at Joh@@ ns Hop@@ kins Hospital named Le@@ o K@@ ann@@ er.
In 194@@ 3, K@@ an@@ ner published a paper describing 11 young patients who seemed to inhab@@ it private worl@@ ds, ignor@@ ing the people around them, even their own parents.
They could am@@ use themselves for hours by fl@@ apping their hands in front of their faces, but they were pan@@ ic@@ ked by little things like their favorite toy being moved from its usual place without their knowledge.
Bas@@ ed on the patients who were brought to his clin@@ ic, K@@ an@@ ner specul@@ ated that autism is very r@@ are.
By the 1950@@ s, as the world's leading authority on the subject, he declar@@ ed that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syn@@ drome while fiel@@ ding re@@ ferr@@ als from as far away as South Africa.
That's actually not surpris@@ ing, because K@@ an@@ ner@@ 's crit@@ eria for diagnos@@ ing autism were incredibly selec@@ tive.
For example, he dis@@ cour@@ aged giving the diagnosis to children who had se@@ iz@@ ures but now we know that epilep@@ sy is very common in autism.
He once br@@ ag@@ ged that he had turned nine out of 10 kids referred to his office as autistic by other cl@@ inici@@ ans without giving them an autism diagnos@@ is.
K@@ an@@ ner was a smart guy, but a number of his theories didn't p@@ an out.
He classi@@ fied autism as a form of infanti@@ le psych@@ os@@ is caused by cold and un@@ affec@@ tion@@ ate parents.
These children, he said, had been kept ne@@ at@@ ly in a refriger@@ ator that didn't de@@ fr@@ os@@ t.
At the same time, however, K@@ an@@ ner noticed that some of his young patients had special abilities that clus@@ tered in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One boy in his clinic could distinguish between 18 sym@@ phon@@ ies before he turned two.
When his mother put on one of his favorite recor@@ ds, he would correc@@ tly declar@@ e, "@@ Beetho@@ ven@@ !"
But K@@ an@@ ner took a di@@ m view of these abil@@ ities, claim@@ ing that the kids were just reg@@ urg@@ it@@ ating things they'd heard their pom@@ pou@@ s parents say, desperate to earn their ap@@ prov@@ al.
As a result, autism became a source of shame and stig@@ ma for families, and two generations of autistic children were shipped off to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world at large.
Amaz@@ ingly, it wasn't until the 197@@ 0s that researchers began to test K@@ an@@ ner@@ 's theory that autism was r@@ are.
Lor@@ na W@@ ing was a cognitive psychologist in London who thought that K@@ an@@ ner@@ 's theory of refriger@@ ator parent@@ ing were "@@ bloody stupid@@ ," as she told me.
She and her husband John were warm and affec@@ tion@@ ate people, and they had a profoundly autistic daughter named Susi@@ e.
Lor@@ na and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like Susi@@ e without support services, special education, and the other resources that are out of reach without a diagnos@@ is.
To make the case to the National Health Ser@@ vice that more resources were needed for autistic children and their families, Lor@@ na and her colleague Jud@@ ith G@@ ould decided to do something that should have been done 30 years earlier.
They under@@ took a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
They p@@ ounded the pav@@ ement in a London sub@@ ur@@ b called Cam@@ ber@@ well to try to find autistic children in the community.
What they saw made clear that K@@ an@@ ner@@ 's model was way too narro@@ w, while the reality of autism was much more color@@ ful and diver@@ se.
Some kids couldn't talk at all, while others wa@@ x@@ ed on at length about their fascin@@ ation with astr@@ ophys@@ ics, dinosaurs or the gene@@ alog@@ y of ro@@ y@@ al@@ ty.
In other words, these children didn't fit into nice, neat box@@ es, as Jud@@ ith put it, and they saw lots of them, way more than K@@ an@@ ner@@ 's mon@@ oli@@ th@@ ic model would have predic@@ ted.
At first, they were at a loss to make sense of their data.
How had no one noticed these children befor@@ e?
But then Lor@@ na came upon a reference to a paper that had been published in German in 194@@ 4, the year after K@@ an@@ ner@@ 's paper, and then for@@ got@@ ten, buried with the ash@@ es of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember or think about.
K@@ an@@ ner knew about this competing paper, but scr@@ up@@ ul@@ ously avoid@@ ed mention@@ ing it in his own work.
It had never even been translated into English, but luckily, Lor@@ n@@ a's husband spoke Ger@@ man, and he translated it for her.
The paper offered an altern@@ ate story of autism.
Its author was a man named Hans As@@ per@@ ger, who ran a combination clinic and res@@ idential school in Vi@@ en@@ na in the 1930@@ s.
As@@ per@@ ger@@ 's ideas about teaching children with learning differences were progress@@ ive even by contemporary standar@@ ds.
Mor@@ nings at his clinic began with exercise classes set to music, and the children put on plays on Sunday afterno@@ ons.
Instead of bl@@ aming parents for causing autism, As@@ per@@ ger fr@@ amed it as a lifel@@ ong, poly@@ genetic disability that requires compassionate forms of support and accommod@@ ations over the course of one's whole life.
Rather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients, As@@ per@@ ger called them his little profess@@ ors, and en@@ listed their help in developing methods of education that were particularly su@@ ited to them.
Cru@@ ci@@ ally, As@@ per@@ ger viewed autism as a diverse continu@@ um that sp@@ ans an astonishing range of gif@@ ted@@ ness and dis@@ ability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits are common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continu@@ um in familiar arch@@ et@@ y@@ pes from pop culture like the socially awkward scientist and the ab@@ sent@@ -@@ min@@ ded professor.
He went so far as to say, it seems that for success in science and art, a d@@ ash of autism is essenti@@ al.
Lor@@ na and Jud@@ ith realized that K@@ an@@ ner had been as wrong about autism being rare as he had been about parents causing it.
Over the next several years, they quiet@@ ly worked with the American Psy@@ chi@@ atric Association to broad@@ en the crit@@ eria for diagnosis to reflect the diversity of what they called "the autism spectr@@ um@@ ."
In the late '80@@ s and early 1990s, their changes went into effect, sw@@ apping out K@@ an@@ ner@@ 's narrow model for As@@ per@@ ger@@ 's broad and inclusive one.
These changes weren't happening in a vacu@@ um.
By coincid@@ ence, as Lor@@ na and Jud@@ ith worked behind the scenes to reform the cr@@ iter@@ ia, people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time.
Before "R@@ ain Man@@ " came out in 198@@ 8, only a tiny, ing@@ ro@@ wn circle of experts knew what autism looked like, but after D@@ us@@ tin H@@ off@@ man's un@@ for@@ get@@ table performance as R@@ ay@@ mon@@ d Bab@@ bit@@ t earned "R@@ ain Man@@ " four Academy A@@ wards, pediatr@@ ici@@ ans, psycholog@@ ists, teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like.
Co@@ incident@@ ally, at the same time, the first eas@@ y-@@ to-@@ use clinical tests for diagnos@@ ing autism were introduc@@ ed.
You no longer had to have a connection to that tiny circle of experts to get your child evalu@@ ated.
The combination of "R@@ ain Man@@ ," the changes to the cr@@ iter@@ ia, and the introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of autism awar@@ eness.
The number of diagnos@@ es started to so@@ ar, just as Lor@@ na and Jud@@ ith predic@@ ted, indeed hope@@ d, that it would, enabling autistic people and their families to finally get the support and services they deser@@ ved.
Then Andrew Wa@@ ke@@ field came along to blame the spi@@ ke in diagnos@@ es on vaccin@@ es, a simple, powerful, and seduc@@ tively believ@@ able story that was as wrong as K@@ an@@ ner@@ 's theory that autism was r@@ are.
If the CD@@ C@@ 's current estima@@ te, that one in 6@@ 8 kids in America are on the spectr@@ um, is correc@@ t, autis@@ tics are one of the largest minority groups in the world.
In recent years, autistic people have come together on the Internet to rejec@@ t the notion that they are puzzles to be solved by the next medical break@@ through, co@@ in@@ ing the term "@@ neuro@@ divers@@ ity" to celebrate the vari@@ e@@ ties of human cogni@@ tion.
One way to understand neuro@@ diversity is to think in terms of human operating systems.
Just because a P@@ .C. is not running Windo@@ ws doesn't mean that it's broken.
By autistic standar@@ ds, the normal human brain is easily distrac@@ table, obsess@@ ively social, and suffer@@ s from a de@@ ficit of attention to detail.
To be sure, autistic people have a hard time living in a world not built for them.
[@@ S@@ event@@ y@@ ] years later, we're still catching up to As@@ per@@ ger, who believed that the "@@ c@@ ure@@ " for the most disab@@ ling aspects of autism is to be found in understanding teachers, accommod@@ ating employ@@ ers, supportive communities, and parents who have faith in their children's potential.
An autistic [@@ man@@ ] named Z@@ os@@ ia Z@@ aks once said, "We need all hands on deck to right the ship of humanit@@ y."
As we sa@@ il into an un@@ certain future, we need every form of human intelligence on the planet working together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Cam@@ els are so well adapted to the desert that it's hard to imagine them living anywhere else. But what if we have them peg@@ ged all wrong? What if those big hum@@ ps, feet and eyes were evolved for a different climate and a different time? In this talk, join Radi@@ ol@@ ab@@ 's L@@ ati@@ f N@@ ass@@ er as he tells the surprising story of how a very tiny, very strange fossil u@@ pen@@ ded the way he sees cam@@ els, and the world. This talk comes from the P@@ B@@ S special "@@ TED Tal@@ k@@ s: Science &amp; Won@@ der@@ ."
L@@ ati@@ f N@@ asser@@ : You have no idea where cam@@ els really come from.
So, this is a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman, Nat@@ alia Ry@@ b@@ c@@ z@@ yn@@ sk@@ i.
She's a pale@@ obi@@ ologist, which means she speci@@ aliz@@ es in digging up really old dead stuff.
Nat@@ alia Ry@@ b@@ c@@ z@@ yn@@ sk@@ i: Yeah, I had someone call me "@@ Dr. De@@ ad Th@@ ing@@ s."
L@@ ati@@ f N@@ asser@@ : And I think she's particularly interesting because of where she dig@@ s that stuff up, way above the Arctic Cir@@ cle in the remote Canadian t@@ und@@ ra.
Now, one summer day in 2006, she was at a dig site called the F@@ y@@ les Le@@ a@@ f B@@ ed, which is less than 10 degrees l@@ atitude away from the magnetic north po@@ le.
N@@ R: Re@@ ally, it's not going to sound very excit@@ ing, because it was a day of walking with your back@@ pack and your GPS and note@@ book and just picking up anything that might be a fos@@ s@@ il.
L@@ N: And at some point, she noticed something.
N@@ R: R@@ ust@@ y, kind of rus@@ t-@@ color@@ ed, about the size of the palm of my hand.
It was just lying on the surface.
L@@ N: And at first she thought it was just a spl@@ in@@ ter of wood, because that's the sort of thing people had found at the F@@ y@@ les Le@@ a@@ f B@@ ed before - pre@@ historic plant parts.
But that night, back at camp ...
N@@ R: ... I get out the hand l@@ ens, I'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing it doesn't quite look like this has tree r@@ ings.
Maybe it's a preserv@@ ation thing, but it looks really like ...
B@@ one.
L@@ N: Hu@@ h. So over the next four years, she went to that spot over and over, and eventually collected 30 frag@@ ments of that exact same bone, most of them really tin@@ y.
N@@ R: It's not a whole lot. It fits in a small Z@@ i@@ plo@@ c bag@@ .
L@@ N: And she tried to piece them together like a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle.
But it was challeng@@ ing.
N@@ R: It's broken up into so many little tiny pieces, I'm trying to use sand and put@@ ty, and it's not looking good.
So finally, we used a 3D surface scan@@ ner.
L@@ N: O@@ o@@ h! N@@ R: Yeah, right?
L@@ N: It turns out it was way easier to do it virtu@@ ally.
N@@ R: It's kind of magical when it all fits together.
L@@ N: How certain were you that you had it right, that you had put it together in the right way?
Was there a potential that you'd put it together a different way and have, like, a par@@ ake@@ et or some@@ thing?
N@@ R: Um, no. No, we got this.
L@@ N: What she had, she discovered, was a ti@@ bia, a leg bone, and specifically, one that belong@@ ed to a clo@@ ven@@ -@@ ho@@ of@@ ed mam@@ mal, so something like a cow or a she@@ ep.
But it couldn't have been either of those.
It was just too big.
N@@ R: The size of this thing, it was hu@@ ge. It's a really big animal.
L@@ N: So what animal could it be?
Having hit a wall, she showed one of the frag@@ ments to some colleagues of hers in Color@@ ado, and they had an idea.
N@@ R: We took a saw, and we nic@@ ked just the edge of it, and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it.
L@@ N: It smel@@ led kind of like sing@@ ed fl@@ es@@ h.
It was a smell that Nat@@ alia recognized from cutting up skul@@ ls in her gross an@@ at@@ omy lab@@ : col@@ lag@@ en.
Col@@ lag@@ en is what gives structure to our bon@@ es.
And usu@@ ally, after so many years, it breaks down.
But in this case, the Arctic had ac@@ ted like a natural freez@@ er and preser@@ ved it.
Then a year or two later, Nat@@ alia was at a conference in Br@@ ist@@ ol, and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buck@@ ley was demo@@ ing this new process that he called "@@ col@@ lag@@ en finger@@ prin@@ t@@ ing."
It turns out that different species have slightly different structures of col@@ lag@@ en, so if you get a col@@ lag@@ en profile of an unknown bone, you can compare it to those of known species, and, who knows, maybe you get a mat@@ ch.
So she shipped him one of the frag@@ ments, Fed@@ Ex@@ .
N@@ R: Yeah, you want to track it. It's kind of important.
L@@ N: And he processed it, and compared it to 37 known and modern@@ -day mam@@ mal species.
And he found a mat@@ ch.
It turns out that the 3.@@ 5 million@@ -year-old bone that Nat@@ alia had du@@ g out of the High Arctic belong@@ ed to ...
A cam@@ el.
N@@ R: And I'm thinking, what? That's amazing - if it's true.
L@@ N: So they tested a bunch of the frag@@ ments, and they got the same result for each one.
However, based on the size of the bone that they found, it meant that this cam@@ el was 30 percent larger than modern@@ -day cam@@ els.
So this cam@@ el would have been about nine feet tal@@ l, weigh@@ ed around a ton.
Yeah.
Nat@@ alia had found a Gi@@ ant Arctic cam@@ el.
Now, when you hear the word "@@ camel@@ ," what may come to mind is one of these, the Bac@@ tri@@ an cam@@ el of East and Central Asia.
But chances are the post@@ card image you have in your brain is one of these, the dro@@ me@@ dar@@ y, quin@@ t@@ essential desert creature - hang@@ s out in sand@@ y, hot places like the Middle East and the Sahar@@ a, has a big old hum@@ p on its back for stor@@ ing water for those long desert tre@@ ks, has big, broad feet to help it trom@@ p over sand dun@@ es.
So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arc@@ tic@@ ?
Well, scientists have known for a long time, turns out, even before Nat@@ ali@@ a's discovery, that cam@@ els are actually originally American.
They started here.
For nearly 40 of the 45 million years that cam@@ els have been around, you could only find them in North America, around 20 different species, maybe more.
L@@ N: If I put them all in a lin@@ e@@ up, would they look different@@ ?
N@@ R: Yeah, you're going to have different body siz@@ es.
You'll have some with really long nec@@ ks, so they're actually function@@ ally like giraf@@ f@@ es.
L@@ N: Some had sn@@ out@@ s, like crocodi@@ les.
N@@ R: The really primi@@ tive, early ones would have been really small, almost like rab@@ bit@@ s.
L@@ N: Wh@@ at? Rab@@ bit@@ -@@ sized camel@@ s?
N@@ R: The earliest ones.
So those ones you probably would not recogn@@ ize.
L@@ N: Oh my God, I want a pet rab@@ bit@@ -@@ cam@@ el.
N@@ R: I know, wouldn't that be great@@ ?
L@@ N: And then about three to seven million years ago, one branch of cam@@ els went down to South America, where they became l@@ lam@@ as and al@@ pac@@ as, and another branch crossed over the B@@ ering L@@ and Br@@ idge into Asia and Africa.
And then around the end of the last ice age, North American cam@@ els went extinc@@ t.
So, scientists knew all of that already, but it still doesn't fully explain how Nat@@ alia found one so far nor@@ th.
Like, this is, temper@@ ature@@ -@@ wise, the polar opposite of the Sahar@@ a.
Now to be fa@@ ir, three and a half million years ago, it was on average 22 degrees Celsi@@ us war@@ mer than it is now.
So it would have been bore@@ al forest, so more like the Yu@@ k@@ on or Siber@@ ia today.
But still, like, they would have six-@@ month@@ -long winter@@ s where the pon@@ ds would free@@ ze over.
You'd have b@@ liz@@ z@@ ar@@ ds.
You'd have 24 hours a day of straight darkness.
Like, how ... Ho@@ w?
How is it that one of these Saharan super@@ stars could ever have survived those arc@@ tic condition@@ s?
Nat@@ alia and her colleagues think they have an answer.
And it's kind of brilli@@ ant.
What if the very features that we imagine make the cam@@ el so well-@@ su@@ ited to places like the Sahar@@ a, actually evolved to help it get through the winter@@ ?
What if those broad feet were meant to trom@@ p not over sand, but over snow, like a pair of snow@@ sho@@ es?
What if that hum@@ p - which, huge news to me, does not contain water, it contains fat - was there to help the cam@@ el get through that six-@@ month@@ -long winter@@ , when food was scar@@ ce?
And then, only later, long after it crossed over the land bridge did it retrof@@ it those winter features for a hot desert environment@@ ?
Like, for instance, the hum@@ p may be helpful to cam@@ els in hot@@ ter cli@@ mes because having all your fat in one place, like a, you know, fat back@@ pac@@ k, means that you don't have to have that insul@@ ation all over the rest of your body.
So it helps heat dissi@@ p@@ ate easier.
It's this crazy idea, that what seems like proof of the camel@@ 's quin@@ t@@ essential desert nature could actually be proof of its High Arctic past.
Now, I'm not the first person to tell this story.
Others have told it as a way to mar@@ vel at evolutionary biology or as a key@@ hole into the future of climate change.
But I love it for a totally different reason.
For me, it's a story about us, about how we see the world and about how that changes.
So I was trained as a histori@@ an.
And I've learned that, actually, a lot of scientists are histori@@ ans, too.
They make sense of the past.
They tell the history of our universe, of our planet, of life on this planet.
And as a histori@@ an, you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes.
N@@ R: We make up stories and we stick with it, like the cam@@ el in the deser@@ t, right?
That's a great story@@ ! It's totally adapted for that.
Clear@@ ly, it always lived there.
L@@ N: But at any moment, you could un@@ cover some tiny bit of evidence.
You could learn some tiny thing that forces you to re@@ frame everything you thought you kne@@ w.
Like, in this case, this one scientist finds this one sh@@ ard of what she thought was wood, and because of that, science has a totally new and totally counter@@ intuitive theory about why this absur@@ d Dr. Se@@ us@@ s-@@ looking creature looks the way it does.
And for me, it completely u@@ pen@@ ded the way I think of the cam@@ el.
It went from being this ridicul@@ ously nic@@ he creature su@@ ited only to this one specific environment, to being this world travel@@ er that just happens to be in the Sahar@@ a, and could end up virtually anywhere.
This is Az@@ uri@@ .
Az@@ uri@@ , hi, how are you doing?
OK, here, I've got one of these for you here.
So Az@@ ur@@ i is on a break from her regular gi@@ g at the Rad@@ io City Music H@@ all.
That's not even a joke.
Any@@ way - But really, Az@@ ur@@ i is here as a living remin@@ der that the story of our world is a dynamic one.
It requires our willingness to read@@ just, to re@@ imagine.
Right, Az@@ uri@@ ?
And, really, that we're all just one sh@@ ard of bone away from seeing the world ane@@ w.
Thank you very much.

I was sitting in a dive bar outside of Columbia University, where I studied computer science and neurosci@@ ence, and I was having this great conversation with a fellow student about the power of h@@ olo@@ grams to one day replace computers.
And just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation, of course, his phone lights up.
And he pulls it towards himself, and he looks down and he starts typ@@ ing.
And then he forces his ey@@ eb@@ alls back up to mine and he goes, "@@ Keep going. I'm with you."
But of course his eyes were gl@@ az@@ ed over, and the moment was dead.
Mean@@ while across the bar, I noticed another student holding his phone, this time towards a group.
He was swi@@ ping through pictures on In@@ st@@ agr@@ am, and these kids were laughing hy@@ ster@@ ically.
And that dic@@ ho@@ to@@ my between how cr@@ appy I was feeling and how happy they were feeling about the same technology, really got me thinking.
And the more I thought of it, the more I realized it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here, it was simply the display position that was separ@@ ating me from my friend and that was b@@ inding those kids together.
See, they were connected around something, just like our ancestors who evolved their social cogni@@ tions telling stories around the camp@@ fire.
And that's exactly what tools should do, I think.
They should extend our bodies.
And I think computers today are doing quite the opposite.
Whether you're sending an email to your wife or you're compos@@ ing a sym@@ phony or just con@@ sol@@ ing a friend, you're doing it in pretty much the same way.
You're hun@@ ched over these rectang@@ les, fum@@ bling with but@@ tons and men@@ us and more rectang@@ les.
And I think this is the wrong way, I think we can start using a much more natural machine.
We should use machines that bring our work back into the world.
We should use machines that use the principles of neuroscience to extend our senses versus going against them.
Now it just so happens that I have such a machine here.
It's called the M@@ eta 2.
Let's try it out.
Now in front of me right now, I can see the audience, and I can see my very hands.
And in three, two, one, we're going to see an immer@@ sive h@@ olo@@ gram appe@@ ar, a very realistic h@@ olo@@ gram appear in front of me, of our very glasses I'm wearing on my head right now.
And of course this could be anything that we're shopping for or learning from, and I can use my hands to very nic@@ ely kind of move it around with fine control.
And I think Ir@@ on Man would be prou@@ d.
We're going to come back to this in just a bit.
Now if you're anything like me, your mind is already re@@ eling with the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology, so let's look at a fe@@ w.
My mom is an architect, so naturally the first thing I imagined was laying out a building in 3D space instead of having to use these 2@@ D floor plan@@ s.
She's actually touching graphics right now and selec@@ ting an interior decor@@ .
This was all shot through a Go@@ Pr@@ o through our very glass@@ es.
And this next use case is very personal to me, it's Professor Adam G@@ azz@@ al@@ ey@@ 's glass brain project, cour@@ tes@@ y of UC@@ S@@ F.
As a neuroscience student, I would always fantas@@ ize about the ability to learn and memor@@ ize these complex brain structures with an actual machine, where I could touch and play with the various brain structures.
Now what you're seeing is called aug@@ mented reality, but to me, it's part of a much more important story - a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices, instead of the other way around.
Now ...
In the next few years, humanit@@ y's going to go through a shif@@ t, I think.
We're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world.
Just imagine for a moment what this could mean for storytell@@ ers, for pa@@ inter@@ s, for brain surge@@ ons, for interior decor@@ ators and maybe for all of us here today.
And what I think we need to do as a community, is really try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that ex@@ tends the human experience, instead of gam@@ if@@ ying our reality or cl@@ ut@@ tering it with digital information.
And that's what I'm very passionate about.
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.
This is not the smallest device - in about five years, these are all going to look like stri@@ ps of glass on our eyes that project h@@ olo@@ gram@@ s.
And just like we don't care so much about which phone we buy in terms of the hardware - we buy it for the operating system - as a neuros@@ cientist@@ , I always dream@@ t of building the i@@ OS of the mind, if you will.
And it's very, very important that we get this right, because we might be living inside of these things for at least as long as we've lived with the Windo@@ ws graph@@ ical user interface.
And I don't know about you, but living inside of Windo@@ ws scar@@ es me.
To isol@@ ate the single most intuitive interface out of infin@@ ity, we use neuroscience to drive our design guid@@ el@@ ines, instead of letting a bunch of designers fight it out in the boar@@ dro@@ om.
And the principle we all revol@@ ve around is what's called the "@@ Neur@@ al P@@ ath of Le@@ ast Res@@ ist@@ ance@@ ."
At every turn, we're connecting the i@@ OS of the brain with our brain on, for the first time, our brain's terms.
In other words, we're trying to create a zero lear@@ n@@ ing-@@ curve computer.
We're building a system that you've always known how to use.
Here are the first three design guid@@ el@@ ines that we emplo@@ y in this br@@ and-@@ new form of user experience.
First and for@@ em@@ os@@ t, you are the operating system.
Tr@@ adi@@ tional file systems are complex and abstr@@ act, and they take your brain extra steps to de@@ code them.
We're going against the Neur@@ al P@@ ath of Le@@ ast Res@@ ist@@ ance.
Meanwhile, in aug@@ mented reality, you can of course place your h@@ olo@@ graphic TED panel over here, and your h@@ olo@@ graphic email on the other side of the des@@ k, and your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and re@@ tri@@ eve them.
You could put your h@@ olo@@ graphic Tesla that you're shopping for - or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show.
Perfec@@ t. And your brain knows exactly how to get it back.
The second interface guid@@ eline we call "@@ touch to see@@ ."
What do babies do when they see something that grab@@ s their interest@@ ?
They try and reach out and touch it.
And that's exactly how the natural machine should work as well.
Turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense we call propri@@ oc@@ ep@@ tion - that's the sense of our body parts in space.
So by touching our work direc@@ tly, we're not only going to control it better, we're also going to understand it much more dee@@ pl@@ y.
H@@ ence, touch to see.
But it's not enough to experience things ourselves.
We're inherently these social primat@@ es.
And this leads me to our third guid@@ el@@ ine, the h@@ olo@@ graphic camp@@ fire from our first story.
Our mirr@@ or-@@ neuron sub@@ system suggests that we can connect with each other and with our work much better if we can see each other's faces and hands in 3D.
So if you look at the video behind me, you can see two M@@ eta users playing around with the same h@@ olo@@ gr@@ am, making eye contac@@ t, connected around this thing, instead of being distrac@@ ted by external devices.
Let's go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind.
So again, our favorite interface, the i@@ OS of the mind.
I'm going to now take a step further and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses and leave it right here by the des@@ k.
I'm now with you, I'm in the moment, we're connec@@ ting.
My spatial memory kic@@ ks in, and I can go ahead and grab it and bring it right back here, remin@@ ding me that I am the operating system.
And now my propri@@ oc@@ ep@@ tion is working, and I can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts and touch the very sensor that is currently scanning my hand.
But it's not enough to see things alone, so in a second, my co-@@ founder Ray is going to make a 3D call - R@@ ay?
H@@ ey R@@ ay, how@@ 's it go@@ ing?
Gu@@ ys, I can see this guy in front me in full 3D.
And he is photo@@ -@@ real@@ istic.
Thank you.
My mirr@@ or-@@ neuron sub@@ system suggests that this is going to replace phones in not too long.
R@@ ay, how@@ 's it go@@ ing?
R@@ ay@@ : Gre@@ at. We're live today.
MG: R@@ ay, give the crowd a gift of the h@@ olo@@ graphic brain we saw from the video earlier.
Gu@@ ys, this is not only going to change phones, it's also going to change the way we collabor@@ ate.
Thank you so much.
Than@@ ks, R@@ ay.
R@@ ay@@ : You're wel@@ come.
MG: So fol@@ ks, this is the message that I discovered in that bar in 201@@ 1: The future of computers is not locked inside one of these scre@@ ens.
It's right here, inside of us.
So if there's one idea that I could leave you with here today, it's that the natural machine is not some fig@@ ment of the future, it's right here in 201@@ 6.
Which is why all hundred of us at Met@@ a, including the administr@@ ative staf@@ f, the execu@@ tives, the designers, the engineers - before TED@@ 201@@ 7, we're all going to be throwing away our external monit@@ ors and replacing them with a truly and profoundly more natural machine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, appreciate it.
Than@@ ks, guys.
Chris Anderson: So help me out on one thing, because there@@ 've been a few aug@@ mented reality demos shown over the last year or so out there.
And there's sometimes a debate among technolog@@ ists about, are we really seeing the real thing on-@@ scre@@ en?
There's this issue of field of view, that somehow the technology is showing a broader view than you would actually see wearing the glass@@ es.
W@@ ere we seeing the real deal there?
MG: Absolu@@ tely the real deal.
Not only that, we took extra measures to shoot it with a Go@@ Pr@@ o through the actual lens in the various videos that you've seen here.
We want to try to simulate the experience for the world that we're actually seeing through the glass@@ es, and not cut any cor@@ ners.
CA: Thank you so much for showing us that.
MG: Thanks so much, I appreciate that.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Conserv@@ atives and liber@@ als both believe that they alone are motivated by love while their oppon@@ ents are motivated by h@@ ate. How can we solve problems with so much polariz@@ ation? In this talk, social scientist Arthur Bro@@ oks shares ideas for what we can each do as individuals to break the gr@@ id@@ loc@@ k. "We might just be able to take the gh@@ as@@ tly holy war of ide@@ ology that we're suffering under and turn it into a competition of ide@@ as@@ ," he say@@ s.
Arthur Brook@@ s: A conserv@@ ati@@ ve@@ 's ple@@ a: Let's work together.
I come from one of the most liber@@ al, toler@@ ant, progress@@ ive places in the United States, Seattle, Washington.
And I grew up with a family of great Seatt@@ lit@@ es.
My mother was an artist, my father was a college professor, and I am truly grateful for my up@@ br@@ ing@@ ing, because I always felt completely comfortable designing my life exactly as I saw f@@ it.
And in point of fact, I took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind.
When I was 19, I dropped out of college - dropped out, kicked out, spl@@ itting hair@@ s.
And I went on the road as a professional French hor@@ n play@@ er, which was my lifel@@ ong dream.
I played cham@@ ber music all over the United States and Europe, and I tou@@ red for a couple of years with a great jazz gu@@ itar player named Charlie Bir@@ d.
And by the end of my 20@@ s, I wound up as a member of the Bar@@ cel@@ ona Sym@@ phony Orchestr@@ a in S@@ pain.
What a great life.
And you know, my parents never complain@@ ed.
They supported me all the way through it.
It wasn't their dream.
They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "@@ Our son, he's taking a gap decad@@ e."
There was, however, one awkward conversation about my lifestyle that I want to tell you about.
I was 2@@ 7, and I was home from Bar@@ cel@@ ona, and I was visiting my parents for Christ@@ mas, and I was cooking dinner with my mother, and we were alone in the kitch@@ en.
And she was qui@@ et, too qui@@ et.
Something was wrong.
And so I said, "M@@ om, what's on your mind@@ ?"
And she said, "@@ Your dad and I are really worried about you."
And I said, "Wh@@ at@@ ?" I mean, what could it be, at this poin@@ t?
And she said, "I want you to be completely honest with me: have you been voting for Republic@@ ans@@ ?"
Now, the truth is, I wasn't really politic@@ al, I was just a French hor@@ n player.
But I had a bit of an epi@@ phan@@ y, and they had detec@@ ted it, and it was causing some confus@@ ion.
You see, I had become an enth@@ usi@@ ast for capitalis@@ m, and I want to tell you why that is.
It s@@ tem@@ s from a lifel@@ ong interest of mine in, believe it or not, poverty.
See, when I was a kid growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We were a lower middle class family, but that's of course not real poverty.
That's not even close.
The first time I saw poverty, and pover@@ ty@@ 's face, was when I was six or seven years old, early 197@@ 0s.
And it was like a lot of you, kind of a pros@@ a@@ ic example, kind of tri@@ te.
It was a picture in the National Geographic Magaz@@ ine of a kid who was my age in East Africa, and there were flies on his face and a dist@@ ended bell@@ y.
And he wasn't going to make it, and I knew that, and I was helpl@@ ess.
Some of you remember that picture, not exactly that picture, one just like it.
It introduced the West to gr@@ inding poverty around the world.
Well, that vision kind of haun@@ ted me as I grew up and I went to school and I dropped out and dropped in and started my family.
And I wondered, what happened to that kid@@ ?
Or to people just like him all over the world?
And so I started to study, even though I wasn't in college, I was looking for the answ@@ er: what happened to the world's poorest people?
Has it gotten wor@@ se? Has it gotten better? Wh@@ at?
And I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
See - most Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse since we were children, since they saw that vision.
If you ask Americans, "H@@ as poverty gotten worse or better around the world@@ ?", 70 percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 197@@ 0s.
But here's the truth.
Here's the epi@@ ph@@ any that I had that changed my thinking.
From 19@@ 70 until today, the percentage of the world's population living in star@@ v@@ ation levels, living on a dollar a day or less, obviously adjus@@ ted for infl@@ ation, that percentage has declin@@ ed by 80 percent.
There's been an 80 percent decline in the world's worst poverty since I was a kid.
And I didn't even know about it.
This, my friends, that's a mirac@@ le.
That's something we ought to celebr@@ ate.
It's the greatest anti@@ poverty achiev@@ ement in the history of man@@ kind, and it happened in our life@@ times.
So when I learned this, I asked, what did that? What made it possible?
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you want to replicate it and get the next two billion people out of poverty, because that's what we're talking about: since I was a kid, two billion of the least of these, our brothers and sis@@ ters, have been pulled out of poverty.
I want the next two billion, so I've got to know why.
And I went in search of an answer.
And it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care.
You know what, I still don't care.
I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists left, right and center.
And here it is.
Here are the reasons.
There are five reasons that two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of poverty since I was a kid.
Number one: globaliz@@ ation.
Number two: free trade.
Number thre@@ e: property rights.
Number four@@ : rule of law.
Number fi@@ ve: entrepreneur@@ ship.
It was the free enterpris@@ e system spreading around the world after 19@@ 70 that did that.
Now, I'm not nai@@ ve.
I know that free enterpris@@ e isn't perfect, and I know that free enterpris@@ e isn't everything we need to build a better world.
But that is great. And that's beyond politics.
Here's what I lear@@ ned. This is the epi@@ phan@@ y.
Capit@@ alism is not just about accumul@@ ation.
At its best, it's about aspir@@ ation, which is what so many people on this stage talk about, is the aspir@@ ation that comes from dreams that are embedded in the free enterpris@@ e system.
And we've got to share it with more people.
Now, I want to tell you about a second epi@@ ph@@ any that's related to that first one that I think can bring us progress, not just around the world, but right here at home.
The best quote I've ever heard to summar@@ ize the thoughts that I've just given you about pulling people out of poverty is as follow@@ s: "@@ Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
They have lifted billions out of pover@@ ty@@ ."
Who said it?
It sounds like Mil@@ ton Fried@@ man or Ronald Reag@@ an.
W@@ r@@ ong.
President Barack Obama said that.
Why do I know it by hear@@ t?
Because he said it to me.
C@@ raz@@ y.
And I said, "H@@ all@@ el@@ u@@ j@@ ah@@ ."
But more than that, I said, "What an opportun@@ ity."
You know what I was think@@ ing?
It was at an event that we were doing on the subject at Geor@@ ge@@ town University in May of 2015.
And I thought, this is the solution to the biggest problem facing America today. Wh@@ at?
It's coming together around these ideas, liber@@ als and conserv@@ atives, to help people who need us the most.
Now, I don't have to tell anybody in this room that we're in a crisis, in America and many countries around the world with political polariz@@ ation.
It's ris@@ en to critic@@ al, crisis levels.
It's un@@ pleas@@ ant. It's not right.
There was an article last year in the Pr@@ oce@@ ed@@ ings of the National Academy of Sci@@ ences, which is one of the most presti@@ gi@@ ous scientific journ@@ als published in the West.
And it was an article in 201@@ 4 on political motive as@@ ym@@ metr@@ y.
What's that? That's what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your ide@@ ology is based in love but your oppon@@ ent@@ s' ide@@ ology is based in h@@ ate.
It's common in world conflict.
You expect to see this between Palestin@@ ians and Israel@@ is, for example.
What the authors of this article found was that in America today, a majority of Republic@@ ans and Democr@@ ats suffer from political motive as@@ ym@@ metr@@ y.
A majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by h@@ ate.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people are walking around saying, "You know, my ide@@ ology is based on basic ben@@ evol@@ ence, I want to help people, but the other guys, they're evil and out to get me."
You can't progress as a society when you have this kind of as@@ ym@@ metr@@ y.
It's impossible.
How do we solve it?
Well, first, let's be honest@@ : there are differences.
Let's not minim@@ ize the differences. That would be really na@@ ï@@ ve.
There's a lot of good research on this.
A veter@@ an of the TED stage is my friend Jonathan Ha@@ id@@ t.
He's a psychology professor at New York Univers@@ ity.
He does work on the ide@@ ology and values and mor@@ als of different people to see how they differ@@ .
And he's sho@@ wn, for example, that conserv@@ atives and liber@@ als have a very different emphas@@ is on what they think is important.
For example, Jon Ha@@ id@@ t has shown that liber@@ als care about poverty 59 percent more than they care about economic liber@@ ty.
And conserv@@ atives care about economic liber@@ ty 28 percent more than they care about poverty.
Ir@@ recon@@ cil@@ able differ@@ ences, right?
We'll never come together. W@@ r@@ ong.
That is diversity in which lies our streng@@ th.
Remember what pulled up the poor.
It was the obsession with poverty, accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading around the world.
We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty.
There's no other way.
How are we going to get that?
It's a tricky thing, isn't it.
We need innovative thinking.
A lot of it's on this stage.
Social entrepreneur@@ ship. Yeah. Absolu@@ tely. Ph@@ enomen@@ al.
We need investment over@@ seas in a sustain@@ able, responsi@@ ble, ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.
But you know what we really need@@ ?
We need a new day in flexible ide@@ ology.
We need to be less predic@@ table.
Don't we?
Do you ever feel like your own ide@@ ology is starting to get predic@@ tab@@ le?
K@@ inda conven@@ tion@@ al?
Do you ever feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is that danger@@ ous@@ ?
Because when we talk in this country about economics, on the right, conserv@@ atives, you're always talking about taxes and regul@@ ations and big government.
And on the left, liber@@ als, you're talking about economics, it's always about income inequality.
Right? Now those are important things, really important to me, really important to you.
But when it comes to lif@@ ting people up who are star@@ ving and need us today, those are distrac@@ tions.
We need to come together around the best ways to mitig@@ ate poverty using the best tools at our dispos@@ al, and that comes only when conserv@@ atives recognize that they need liber@@ als and their obsession with poverty, and liber@@ als need conserv@@ atives and their obsession with free markets.
That's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country, if we choose to take it.
So how are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together@@ ?
I've got to have some action item@@ s, not just for you but for me.
Number one. Ac@@ tion item number one: remember, it's not good enough just to toler@@ ate people who disagre@@ e.
It's not good enough.
We have to remember that we need people who disagree with us, because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these tools.
Now, what are you going to do? How are you going to express that?
Where does this star@@ t? It starts here.
You know, all of us in this room, we're bl@@ esse@@ d.
We're blessed with people who listen to us.
We're blessed with prosper@@ ity. We're blessed with leadership.
When people hear us, with the kind of un@@ predictable ide@@ ology, then maybe people will listen.
Maybe progress will start at that point.
That's number one. Number two.
Number two: I'm asking you and I'm asking me to be the person specifically who blur@@ s the lines, who is ambigu@@ ous, who is hard to classi@@ f@@ y.
If you're a conserv@@ ative, be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and the moral oblig@@ ation to be a warri@@ or for the poor.
And if you're a liber@@ al, be a liberal who is always talking about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems when we use them responsi@@ bl@@ y.
If we do that, we get two things.
Number one: we get to start to work on the next two billion and be the solution that we've seen so much of in the past and we need to see more of in the future. That's what we get.
And the second is that we might just be able to take the gh@@ as@@ tly holy war of ide@@ ology that we're suffering under in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solid@@ ar@@ ity and mu@@ tual respec@@ t.
And then maybe, just maybe, we'll all realize that our big differences aren't really that big after all.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Tim Ur@@ ban knows that proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation doesn't make sense, but he's never been able to shake his habit of waiting until the last minute to get things done. In this hilari@@ ous and ins@@ ight@@ ful talk, Ur@@ ban takes us on a journey through YouTube b@@ ing@@ es, Wikipedia rab@@ bit holes and b@@ ou@@ ts of staring out the window - and encour@@ ages us to think harder about what we're really proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ating on, before we run out of time.
Tim Ur@@ ban@@ : In@@ side the mind of a master proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator.
So in college, I was a government maj@@ or, which means I had to write a lot of papers.
Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this.
So, you know - you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some he@@ avi@@ er days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil.
And I would want to do that like that.
That would be the plan.
I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this.
And that would happen every single paper.
But then came my 90@@ -@@ page senior thes@@ is, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on.
And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option.
It was way too big a project.
So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this.
This is how the year would go.
So I'd start off light, and I'd bum@@ p it up in the middle months, and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear just like a little stair@@ case.
How hard could it be to walk up the stair@@ s?
No big de@@ al, right?
But then, the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened.
Those first few month@@ s?
They came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff.
So we had an awesome new revis@@ ed plan.
And then - But then those middle months actually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here.
And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks.
And one day I woke up with three days until the dead@@ line, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I coul@@ d: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-@@ nigh@@ ters - humans are not supposed to pull two all-@@ nigh@@ ters - s@@ printed across campus, do@@ ve in slow motion, and got it in just at the dead@@ line.
I thought that was the end of everything.
But a week later I get a call, and it's the school.
And they say, "Is this Tim Ur@@ ban@@ ?"
And I say, "@@ Yeah@@ ."
And they say, "We need to talk about your thes@@ is."
And I say, "@@ OK@@ ."
And they say, "It's the best one we've ever se@@ en@@ ."
That did not happen.
It was a very, very bad thes@@ is.
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought, "This guy is amaz@@ ing@@ !"
No, no, it was very, very bad.
Anyway, today I'm a writ@@ er-@@ blog@@ ger guy.
I write the blog Wa@@ it But Wh@@ y.
And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation.
My behavior has always per@@ plex@@ ed the non-@@ proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-@@ proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ators of the world what goes on in the heads of proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ators, and why we are the way we are.
Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ators were actually different than the brains of other people.
And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-@@ proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator, so I could compare them.
I actually brought them here to show you today.
I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference.
I know that if you're not a trained brain exper@@ t, it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK?
So here's the brain of a non-@@ proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator.
Now ...
Here's my brain.
There is a difference.
Both brains have a R@@ ational Dec@@ ision@@ -@@ Mak@@ er in them, but the proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator@@ 's brain also has an In@@ st@@ ant Gr@@ ati@@ fication Mon@@ key.
Now, what does this mean for the proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator@@ ?
Well, it means every@@ thing's fine until this happens.
[@@ This is a perfect time to get some work don@@ e@@ .] [@@ No@@ pe@@ !@@ ] So the R@@ ational Dec@@ ision@@ -@@ Mak@@ er will make the rational decision to do something produc@@ tive, but the Mon@@ key doesn't like that plan, so he actually takes the whe@@ el, and he says, "A@@ ctu@@ ally, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Ker@@ ri@@ gan@@ / Ton@@ ya Har@@ ding s@@ cand@@ al, because I just remembered that that happened.
Then - Then we're going to go over to the fr@@ id@@ ge, to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago.
After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spir@@ al that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magne@@ ts and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Jus@@ tin Bi@@ e@@ ber@@ 's mo@@ m.
"All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the sch@@ ed@@ ule for any work today.
Sorr@@ y@@ !"
Now, what is going on here?
The In@@ st@@ ant Gr@@ ati@@ fication Mon@@ key does not seem like a guy you want behind the whe@@ el.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun.
Now, in the animal world, that works fine.
If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success@@ !
And to the Mon@@ key, humans are just another animal species.
You have to keep well-@@ sle@@ p@@ t, well-@@ fed and propag@@ ating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked OK.
But, if you haven't notic@@ ed, now we're not in tribal times.
We're in an advanced civilization, and the Mon@@ key does not know what that is.
Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the R@@ ational Dec@@ ision@@ -@@ Mak@@ er, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do.
We can visualize the future.
We can see the big picture.
We can make long-term plan@@ s.
And he wants to take all of that into accoun@@ t.
And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now.
Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-@@ earned le@@ is@@ ure time.
That's why there's an overlap@@ .
Sometimes they agre@@ e.
But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleas@@ ant, for the sa@@ ke of the big picture.
And that's when we have a conflict.
And for the proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Ma@@ kes Sen@@ se circle.
I call it the Dar@@ k Play@@ ground.
Now, the Dar@@ k Play@@ ground is a place that all of you proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ators out there know very well.
It's where le@@ is@@ ure activities happen at times when le@@ is@@ ure activities are not supposed to be happening.
The fun you have in the Dar@@ k Play@@ ground isn't actually fun, because it's completely un@@ ear@@ ned, and the air is filled with guil@@ t, dre@@ ad, anxi@@ ety, self-@@ hat@@ red - all of those good proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator feel@@ ings.
And the question is, in this situation, with the Mon@@ key behind the whe@@ el, how does the proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator ever get himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?
Well, turns out the proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator has a guar@@ di@@ an ang@@ el, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his dark@@ est moments - someone called the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ st@@ er.
Now, the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster is dor@@ man@@ t most of the time, but he suddenly wa@@ kes up any@@ time a dead@@ line gets too close or there's danger of public embarrass@@ ment, a career disaster or some other scary consequ@@ ence.
And importantly, he's the only thing the Mon@@ key is terrified of.
Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Tal@@ k.
Now, of course, I said yes.
It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.
But in the middle of all this excitem@@ ent, the R@@ ational Dec@@ ision@@ -@@ Mak@@ er seemed to have something else on his mind.
He was saying, "Are we clear on what we just accep@@ ted?
Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future?
We need to sit down and work on this right now."
And the Mon@@ key said, "T@@ ot@@ ally agre@@ e, but let's just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and scr@@ oll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for Indi@@ a."
So that's what we did that day.
As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speak@@ ers.
And I opened up the website, and there was my face staring right back at me.
And guess who woke up?
So the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system@@ 's in may@@ h@@ em.
And the Mon@@ key - remember, he's terrified of the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster - boom, he's up the tre@@ e!
And finally, finally, the R@@ ational Dec@@ ision@@ -@@ Mak@@ er can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk.
Now, the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster explains all kinds of pretty ins@@ ane proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miracul@@ ously find the unbelievable work eth@@ ic to stay up all night and write eight pages.
And this entire situation, with the three characters - this is the proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator@@ 's system.
It's not pret@@ ty, but in the end, it works.
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.
When I did, I was amazed by the response.
Liter@@ ally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things.
These are people who were nur@@ ses, bank@@ ers, pa@@ inter@@ s, engineers and lots and lots of Ph@@ D students.
And they were all writing, saying the same thing: "I have this problem to@@ o."
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heav@@ iness of these ema@@ ils.
These people were writing with intense frustr@@ ation about what proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation had done to their lives, about what this Mon@@ key had done to them.
And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator@@ 's system works, then what's going on?
Why are all of these people in such a dark plac@@ e?
Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation.
Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've gi@@ ven, they all have dead@@ lines.
And when there's dead@@ lines, the effects of proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation are contained to the short term because the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster gets involved.
But there's a second kind of proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation that happens in situations when there is no dead@@ line.
So if you wanted a career where you're a self-@@ star@@ ter - something in the ar@@ ts, something entrepreneurial - there's no dead@@ lines on those things at first, because no@@ thing's happening, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get moment@@ um, get things going.
There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any dead@@ lines, like seeing your family or exercis@@ ing and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn't working.
Now if the proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ator@@ 's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-@@ dead@@ line situ@@ ations, the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster doesn't show up.
He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation, they're not contain@@ ed; they just extend outw@@ ard forever.
And it's this long-term kind of proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation that's much less visible and much less talked about than the fun@@ ni@@ er, short-term dead@@ lin@@ e-@@ based kind.
It's usually suffered quiet@@ ly and priv@@ ately.
And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term un@@ happiness, and regre@@ ts.
And I thought, that's why those people are ema@@ il@@ ing, and that's why they're in such a bad place.
It's not that they're cr@@ am@@ ming for some project.
It's that long-term proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ation has made them feel like a spec@@ t@@ ator, at times, in their own lives.
The frustr@@ ation is not that they couldn't achieve their dream@@ s; it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them.
So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epi@@ ph@@ any - that I don't think non-@@ proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ators exist.
That's right - I think all of you are proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ators.
Now, you might not all be a m@@ ess, like some of us, and some of you may have a healthy relationship with dead@@ lines, but remember@@ : the Mon@@ key@@ 's sne@@ ak@@ iest trick is when the dead@@ lines aren't there.
Now, I want to show you one last thing.
I call this a Life Cal@@ end@@ ar.
That's one box for every week of a 90@@ -year life.
That's not that many box@@ es, especially since we've already used a bunch of those.
So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calend@@ ar.
We need to think about what we're really proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ating on, because everyone is proc@@ ras@@ tin@@ ating on something in life.
We need to stay aware of the In@@ st@@ ant Gr@@ ati@@ fication Mon@@ key.
That's a job for all of us.
And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today.
Well, maybe not today, but ...
You know.
Some@@ time soon.
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What do you do when your firmly held beliefs turn out not to be tru@@ e? When Cas@@ ey Ger@@ al@@ d's religion failed him, he sear@@ ched for something new to believe in - in business, in government, in philanthropy - but found only false s@@ avi@@ ors. In this moving talk, Ger@@ ald ur@@ ges us all to question our beliefs and embrace uncertain@@ ty.
Cas@@ ey Ger@@ al@@ d: The gos@@ pel of doub@@ t.
There we were, soul@@ s and bodies packed into a Texas church on the last night of our lives.
Pac@@ ked into a room just like this, but with cre@@ ak@@ y wooden pe@@ ws dra@@ ped in wor@@ n-@@ down red fabric@@ , with an organ to my left and a cho@@ ir at my back and a b@@ ap@@ tis@@ m pool built into the wall behind them.
A room like this, noneth@@ eless.
With the same great feelings of suspen@@ se, the same deep hopes for salv@@ ation, the same swe@@ at in the pal@@ ms and the same people in the back not paying attention.
This was December 3@@ 1, 1999, the night of the Second Com@@ ing of Chr@@ ist, and the end of the world as I knew it.
I had turned 12 that year and had reached the age of account@@ ability.
And once I stopped complain@@ ing about how un@@ fair it was that Jesus would return as soon as I had to be accoun@@ table for all that I had done, I figured I had better get my house in order very quickly.
So I went to church as often as I could.
I listened for silence as anxi@@ ously as one might listen for nois@@ e, trying to be sure that the Lord hadn't pulled a fast one on me and decided to come back ear@@ ly.
And just in case he did, I built a backup plan, by reading the "L@@ ef@@ t Be@@ hind@@ " books that were all the r@@ age at the time.
And I found in their pages that if I was not taken in the rap@@ ture at mid@@ night, I had another shot.
All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the be@@ ast, fight off demon@@ s, pl@@ agu@@ es and the An@@ ti@@ ch@@ ris@@ t himself.
It would be hard - but I knew I could do it.
But planning time was over now.
It was 11@@ :@@ 50@@ p@@ m.
We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us out of the pe@@ ws and down to the altar because he wanted to be pray@@ ing when mid@@ night struc@@ k.
So every fac@@ tion of the con@@ greg@@ ation took its place.
The cho@@ ir stayed in the cho@@ ir st@@ and, the de@@ acon@@ s and their wi@@ ves - or the B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st B@@ our@@ geo@@ is@@ ie as I like to call them - took first position in front of the al@@ tar.
You see, in America, even the Second Com@@ ing of Chris@@ t has a V@@ IP sec@@ tion.
And right behind the B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st B@@ our@@ geo@@ is@@ ie were the elderly - these men and women whose young backs had been b@@ ent under hot s@@ uns in the cotton fields of East Texas, and whose skin seemed to be burn@@ t a cre@@ as@@ eless no@@ ble bro@@ wn, just like the clay of East Texas, and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become outside of East Texas had sometimes been b@@ ent and broken even further than their back@@ s.
Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me.
They had waited their whole lives for this moment, just as their medieval pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors had long@@ ed for the end of the world, and just as my grandmother waited for the Opr@@ ah Win@@ frey Show to come on Chan@@ nel 8 every day at 4 o'@@ cloc@@ k.
And as she made her way to the al@@ tar, I s@@ nuc@@ k right in behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother was going to heav@@ en.
And I thought that if I held on to her hand during this pray@@ er, I might go right on with her.
So I held on and I closed my eyes to listen, to wait.
And the pray@@ ers got lou@@ der.
And the sh@@ ou@@ ts of response to the call of the pray@@ er went up higher even still.
And the organ rolled on in to add the dir@@ ge.
And the heat came on to add to the swe@@ at.
And my hand gri@@ pped fir@@ mer, so I wouldn't be the one left in the field.
My eyes cl@@ en@@ ched tigh@@ ter so I wouldn't see the wheat being separated from the ch@@ af@@ f.
And then a voice ran@@ g out above us: "A@@ men@@ ."
It was over.
I looked at the cloc@@ k.
It was after mid@@ night.
I looked at the el@@ der beli@@ ever@@ s whose s@@ avi@@ or had not come, who were too proud to show any signs of disap@@ point@@ ment, who had believed too much and for too long to start doub@@ ting now.
But I was upset on their be@@ half.
They had been du@@ ped, ho@@ od@@ win@@ k@@ ed, bam@@ boo@@ z@@ led, and I had gone right along with them.
I had pray@@ ed their pray@@ ers, I had yiel@@ ded not to tempt@@ ation as best I could.
I had di@@ pped my head not once, but twice in that s@@ not-@@ induc@@ ing b@@ ap@@ tis@@ m po@@ ol.
I had belie@@ ved.
Now what?
I got home just in time to turn on the television and watch Peter J@@ enn@@ ings ann@@ ounce the new millenni@@ um as it rolled in around the world.
It struck me that it would have been strange anyway, for Jesus to come back again and again based on the different time zon@@ es.
And this made me feel even more ridiculous - hur@@ t, really.
But there on that night, I did not stop believ@@ ing.
I just believed a new thing: that it was possible not to believe.
It was possible the answers I had were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
And now, where there was once a mountain of cer@@ titu@@ de, there was, running right down to its found@@ ation, a spring of doub@@ t, a spring that promised ri@@ vers.
I can trace the whole drama of my life back to that night in that church when my s@@ avi@@ or did not come for me@@ ; when the thing I believed most certainly turned out to be, if not a lie, then not quite the truth.
And even though most of you prepared for Y@@ 2@@ K in a very different way, I'm convinced that you are here because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the dawn of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my Lord refused to come.
And I held out my hand, reaching for something to believe in.
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18, with the faith that my journey from O@@ ak C@@ lif@@ f, Texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known, the broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen.
But when I found myself back home one winter break, with my face planted in the floor, my hands tied behind my back and a bur@@ g@@ lar@@ 's gun pressed to my head, I knew that even the best education couldn't save me.
I held on when I showed up at Le@@ h@@ man Bro@@ thers as an inter@@ n in 2008.
So hopeful - that I called home to inform my family that we'd never be poor again.
But as I witnessed this tem@@ ple of finance come crash@@ ing down before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me.
I held on when I showed up in Washington D@@ C as a young staf@@ fer, who had heard a voice call out from Illin@@ o@@ is, saying, "It's been a long time coming, but in this election, change has come to Americ@@ a."
But as the Congress ground to a hal@@ t and the country ri@@ pped at the se@@ ams and hope and change began to feel like a cruel jo@@ ke, I knew that even the political second coming could not save me.
I had k@@ nel@@ t faith@@ fully at the altar of the American Dre@@ am, pray@@ ing to the gods of my time of success, and money, and power.
But over and over again, mid@@ night struc@@ k, and I opened my eyes to see that all of these gods were dead.
And from that grav@@ ey@@ ard, I began the search once more, not because I was brav@@ e, but because I knew that I would either believe or I would die.
So I took a pil@@ gri@@ mag@@ e to yet another me@@ c@@ ca, Harvard Business School - this time, knowing that I could not simply accept the salv@@ ation that it claimed to offer@@ .
No, I knew there@@ 'd be more work to do.
The work began in the dark corner of a crow@@ ded party, in the late night of an ear@@ ly, miserable Cambridge winter@@ , when three friends and I asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time@@ : "What if we took a road tri@@ p@@ ?"
We didn't know where@@ 'd we go or how we'd get there, but we knew we had to do it.
Because all our lives we year@@ ned, as Jack Ker@@ ou@@ ac wrote, to "@@ sne@@ ak out into the night and disappear some@@ wher@@ e," and go find out what everybody was doing all over the country.
So even though there were other voices who said that the risk was too great and the proof too thin@@ , we went on any@@ how.
We went on 8,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013, through the cow pas@@ tures of Montan@@ a, through the desol@@ ation of Detro@@ it, through the sw@@ am@@ ps of New Orle@@ ans, where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses that made purpose their bottom line.
And having been trained at the West Poin@@ t of capitalis@@ m, this struck us as a revolutionary idea.
And this idea spre@@ ad, growing into a nonprofit called MB@@ As A@@ cross America, a movement that landed me here on this stage today.
It spread because we found a great hunger in our generation for purpose, for meaning.
It spread because we found countless entrepreneurs in the no@@ oks and cr@@ anni@@ es of America who were creating jobs and changing lives and who needed a little help.
But if I'm being honest, it also spread because I fought to spread it.
There was no length to which I would not go to pre@@ ach this gos@@ pel@@ , to get more people to believe that we could bin@@ d the w@@ ounds of a broken country, one social business at a time.
But it was this journey of ev@@ angel@@ ism that led me to the rather different gos@@ pel that I've come to share with you today.
It began one evening almost a year ago at the Museum of Natural Hist@@ ory in New York City, at a gal@@ a for alum@@ ni of Harvard Business Scho@@ ol.
Under a full-@@ size re@@ plica of a whal@@ e, I sat with the tit@@ ans of our time as they celebrated their pe@@ ers and their good de@@ eds.
There was pride in a room where net worth and assets under management sur@@ passed half a trillion dollars.
We looked over all that we had made, and it was good.
But it just so happened, two days later, I had to travel up the road to Har@@ le@@ m, where I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vac@@ ant lot, listening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids that showed up there every day.
All of them lived below the poverty line.
Many of them carried all of their belong@@ ings in a back@@ pack to avoid losing them in a homeless shel@@ ter.
Some of them came to Ton@@ y's program, called Har@@ lem Gro@@ wn, to get the only meal they had each day.
Tony told me that he started Har@@ lem Gro@@ wn with money from his pen@@ sion, after 20 years as a ca@@ b dri@@ ver.
He told me that he didn't give himself a sal@@ ary, because despite success, the program strugg@@ led for resources.
He told me that he would take any help that he could get.
And I was there as that help.
But as I left Ton@@ y, I felt the st@@ ing and salt of tears well@@ ing up in my eyes.
I felt the weight of revel@@ ation that I could sit in one room on one night, where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars, and another room, two days later, just 50 blocks up the road, where a man was going without a sal@@ ary to get a child her only meal of the day.
And it wasn't the g@@ lar@@ ing inequality that made me want to cr@@ y, it wasn't the thought of hungr@@ y, homeless kids, it wasn't r@@ age toward the one percent or p@@ ity toward the 9@@ 9.
No, I was dist@@ ur@@ bed because I had finally realized that I was the dial@@ ys@@ is for a country that needed a kidney transplant@@ .
I realized that my story stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bo@@ ot@@ str@@ ap@@ s, even if they didn't have any bo@@ ot@@ s; that my organization stood in for all the struc@@ tur@@ al, system@@ ic help that never went to Har@@ lem or Ap@@ pal@@ ach@@ ia or the Lo@@ wer 9@@ th W@@ ard@@ ; that my voice stood in for all those voices that seemed too un@@ learned, too un@@ was@@ h@@ ed, too un@@ accommod@@ ated.
And the shame of that, that shame washed over me like the shame of sitting in front of the television, watching Peter J@@ enn@@ ings ann@@ ounce the new millenni@@ um again and again and again.
I had been du@@ ped, ho@@ od@@ win@@ k@@ ed, bam@@ boo@@ z@@ led.
But this time, the false s@@ avi@@ or was me.
You see, I've come a long way from that altar on the night I thought the world would end, from a world where people spoke in ton@@ gues and saw suffering as a necessary act of God and took a text to be in@@ fal@@ li@@ ble truth.
Yes, I've come so far that I'm right back where I started.
Because it simply is not true to say that we live in an age of dis@@ belief - no, we believe today just as much as any time that came before.
Some of us may believe in the proph@@ ec@@ y of Br@@ en@@ é Brown or Tony Rob@@ bin@@ s.
We may believe in the bi@@ ble of The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Re@@ view.
We may believe most deeply when we wor@@ ship right here at the church of TED, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak in the ton@@ gues of char@@ is@@ matic leaders that promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our g@@ od, we take the text of technological progress to be in@@ fal@@ li@@ ble truth.
And we hardly realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one br@@ ick, because we fear it might shake our whole found@@ ation.
But if you are dist@@ ur@@ bed by the un@@ cons@@ cion@@ able things that we have come to accep@@ t, then it must be questioning time.
So I have not a gos@@ pel of disrup@@ tion or innovation or a tri@@ ple bottom line.
I do not have a gos@@ pel of faith to share with you today, in fact.
I have and I offer a gos@@ pel of doub@@ t.
The gos@@ pel of doubt does not ask that you stop believ@@ ing, it asks that you believe a new thing: that it is possible not to believe.
It is possible the answers we have are wrong, it is possible the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, the gos@@ pel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong.
Because it raises the question, "Wh@@ y?"
With all the power that we hold in our hands, why are people still suffering so bad@@ ?
This doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization, MB@@ As A@@ cross America, out of business.
We have shed our staff and closed our doors and we will share our model freely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our per@@ mission.
This doubt comp@@ els me to ren@@ ounce the role of s@@ avi@@ or that some have placed on me, because our time is too short and our odds are too long to wait for second com@@ ings, when the truth is that there will be no mirac@@ les here.
And this doub@@ t, it fuels me, it gives me hope that when our troub@@ les overwhel@@ m us, when the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our de@@ mis@@ e, when our heal@@ ers bring no comfort to our w@@ ounds, it will not be our blind faith - no, it will be our humble doubt that sh@@ ines a little light into the darkness of our lives and of our world and lets us raise our voice to whis@@ per.
Or to sh@@ out or to say simply, very simply, "There must be another way."
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What if we could grow delici@@ ous, nutri@@ ent@@ -@@ dense food, indo@@ ors anywhere in the world? C@@ ale@@ b Har@@ per, director of the Open Agr@@ icul@@ ture I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative at the MIT Media Lab, wants to change the food system by connecting grow@@ ers with technology. Get to know Har@@ per@@ 's "@@ food computer@@ s" and catch a glimpse of what the future of farming might look like.
C@@ ale@@ b Har@@ per@@ : This computer will grow your food in the future.
Fo@@ od crisis.
It's in the news every day.
But what is it?
Some places in the world it's too little food, maybe too much.
Other places, G@@ M@@ O is saving the world.
Maybe G@@ M@@ O is the problem?
Too much agricultural run@@ off creating bad oceans, toxic oceans, atten@@ u@@ ation of nutri@@ tion.
They go on and on.
And I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly dis@@ empower@@ ing.
So how do we bring that to something that we understand@@ ?
How is this apple food cris@@ is?
You've all eaten an apple in the last week, I'm sure.
How old do you think it was from when it was pick@@ ed?
Two week@@ s?
Two month@@ s?
Ele@@ ven months - the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States.
And I don't expect it to be much different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, we put them in cold stor@@ age, we gas the cold storage - there's actually documented proof of workers trying to go into these environments to re@@ tri@@ eve an ap@@ ple, and dying, because the atmosphere that they slow down the process of the apple with is also toxic to humans.
How is it that none of you knew this?
Why didn't I know this?
Nin@@ ety percent of the quality of that apple - all of the anti@@ oxid@@ ants - are gone by the time we get it.
It's basically a little ball of sug@@ ar.
How did we get so information poor and how can we do better?
I think what's missing is a plat@@ form.
I know platforms - I know computers, they put me on the Internet when I was young.
I did very weird things - But I met people, and I could express myself.
How do you express yourself in food@@ ?
If we had a plat@@ form, we might feel empowered to question: What if@@ ?
For me, I question@@ ed: What if climate was democr@@ atic@@ ?
So, this is a map of climate in the world.
The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
They shift and they change, and Califor@@ ni@@ an farmers now become Mexican far@@ mers.
China picks up land in Brazil to grow better food, and we're a sl@@ ave to climate.
What if each country had its own productive clima@@ te?
What would that change about how we li@@ ve?
What would that change about quality of life and nutri@@ tion?
The last gener@@ ation's problem was, we need more food and we need it cheap.
Wel@@ come to your global far@@ m.
We built a huge analog far@@ m.
All these traces - these are cars, plan@@ es, trains and automobil@@ es.
It's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with just a few of us involved in the production of food.
What if ...
We built a digital far@@ m?
A digital world far@@ m.
What if you could take this ap@@ ple, digi@@ tize it somehow, send it through particles in the air and re@@ constitu@@ te it on the other side@@ ?
What if@@ ?
Going through some of these quot@@ es, you know, they inspire me to do what I do.
First one: ["@@ Japanese farming has no you@@ th, no water, no land and no future@@ .@@ "] That's what I landed to the day that I went to Min@@ am@@ is@@ an@@ ri@@ k@@ u, one stop south of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hi@@ ma, after the disaster.
The kids have headed to S@@ end@@ ai and Toky@@ o, the land is contamin@@ ated, they already im@@ port 70 percent of their own food.
But it's not unique to Japan.
Two percent of the American population is involved in far@@ ming.
What good answer comes from two percent of any popul@@ ation?
As we go around the world, 50 percent of the African population is under 18@@ .
E@@ ighty percent don't want to be far@@ mers.
Farm@@ ing is hard.
The life of a small-@@ share@@ hol@@ der farmer is miser@@ able.
They go into the city.
In Indi@@ a: far@@ mer@@ s' families not being able to have basic access to utili@@ ties, more farmer suic@@ ides this year and the previous 10 before that.
It's uncomfortable to talk about.
Where are they go@@ ing?
In@@ to the city.
No young people, and everyone's headed in.
So how do we build this platform that inspi@@ res the you@@ th?
Wel@@ come to the new trac@@ tor.
This is my combin@@ e.
A number of years ago now, I went to B@@ ed B@@ ath and B@@ ey@@ on@@ d and Ho@@ me De@@ pot and I started hack@@ ing.
And I built silly things and I made plants dance and I attached them to my computer and I killed them all - a lot.
I eventually got them to survive.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had in my life, because I was learning the language of plants.
I wanted to make it bigger.
They said, "K@@ n@@ ock yourself out, kid@@ !
Here's an old electronics room that nobody want@@ s.
What can you do?"
With my team, we built a farm inside of the media lab, a place histor@@ ically known not for anything about biology but everything about digital life.
In@@ side of these 60 square feet, we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month - not a lot of food.
And there's a lot of interesting technology in there.
But the most interesting thing?
Be@@ auti@@ ful, white ro@@ ots, deep, green colors and a month@@ ly harv@@ est.
Is this a new cafe@@ teri@@ a?
Is this a new re@@ tail experi@@ ence?
Is this a new grocery stor@@ e?
I can tell you one thing for su@@ re: this is the first time anybody in the media lab ri@@ pped the roots off of anything.
We get our sal@@ ad in bag@@ s; there's nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an ima@@ ge-@@ based processing exper@@ t, a data scientist, a robo@@ tic@@ ist, ri@@ pping roots off and thinking, "H@@ u@@ h. I know something about - I could make this happen, I want to tr@@ y."
In that process we would bring the plants out and we would take some back to the lab, because if you grew it, you don't throw it a@@ way@@ ; it's kind of precious to you.
I have this weird tongue now, because I'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until I've eaten it first, because I want it to be good.
So I eat let@@ tu@@ ce every day and I can tell the p@@ H of a let@@ tu@@ ce within .@@ 1.
I'm like, "No, that's 6.@@ 1 - no, no, you can't eat it today@@ ."
This let@@ tu@@ ce that day was hy@@ per swe@@ et.
It was hy@@ per sweet because the plant had been str@@ essed and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect it@@ self@@ : "I'm not going to di@@ e@@ !"
And the plants not-@@ go@@ ing@@ -to-@@ die, taste sweet to me.
Technolog@@ ists falling backwards into plant physi@@ ology.
So we thought other people needed to be able to try this.
We want to see what people can create, so we conce@@ ived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere.
And then we built it.
So on the fac@@ ade of the media lab is my lab, that has about 30 points of sensing per plant.
If you know about the genome or gene@@ tics, this is the ph@@ eno@@ me, right?
The phenomen@@ a.
When you say, "I like the str@@ aw@@ ber@@ ries from Mexi@@ co@@ ," you really like the str@@ aw@@ ber@@ ries from the climate that produced the expression that you like.
So if you're co@@ ding climate - this much CO2, this much O@@ 2 creates a recipe - you're co@@ ding the expression of that plant, the nutrition of that plant, the size of that plant, the shape, the color, the tex@@ ture.
We need data, so we put a bunch of sensors in there to tell us what's going on.
If you think of your house@@ plants, and you look at your house@@ plant "Why are you dy@@ ing? Won@@ 't you talk to me?"
Far@@ mers develop the most beautiful fortun@@ e-@@ telling eyes by the time they're in their late 60@@ s and 70@@ s.
They can tell you when you see that plant dying that it's a nitrogen defici@@ ency, a calci@@ um defici@@ ency or it needs more hum@@ id@@ ity.
Those beautiful eyes are not being passed down.
These are eyes in the cloud of a far@@ mer.
We trend those data points over time.
We cor@@ relate those data points to individual plants.
These are all the broc@@ col@@ i in my lab that day, by IP addr@@ ess.
We have IP@@ -@@ addr@@ ess@@ able broc@@ coli@@ .
So if that's not weird enough, you can click one and you get a plant profi@@ le.
And what this tells you is down@@ lo@@ ad@@ able progress on that plant, but not like you'd think, it's not just when it's ready.
When does it achieve the nutrition that I need@@ ?
When does it achieve the taste that I desire@@ ?
Is it getting too much wat@@ er?
Is it getting too much sun@@ ?
Al@@ er@@ ts.
It can talk to me, it's convers@@ ant, we have a language.
I think of that as the first user on the plant Facebook, right?
That's a plant profile and that plant will start making friends.
And I mean it - it will make friends with other plants that use less nitrog@@ en, more phosphor@@ us, less pot@@ assi@@ um.
We're going to learn about a complexity that we can only guess at now.
And they may not friend us back - I don't know, they might friend us back, it depends on how we act.
So this is my lab now.
It's a little bit more systema@@ tiz@@ ed, my background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
And so - inside of this environment, we're experiment@@ ing with all kinds of things.
This process, aer@@ opon@@ ics, was developed by NASA for M@@ ir Space St@@ ation for reducing the amount of water they send into space.
What it really does is give the plant exactly what it want@@ s: water, miner@@ als and oxygen.
Roots are not that complicated, so when you give them that, you get this amazing expression.
It's like the plant has two hear@@ ts.
And because it has two hear@@ ts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a perfect world.
We've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adver@@ se world and we're going to continue to do that, but we're going to have a new tool, too, which is perfect world.
So we've grown all kinds of things.
These toma@@ toes hadn't been in commercial production for 150 years.
Do you know that we have rare and ancient seed bank@@ s?
Ban@@ ks of se@@ ed.
It's amazing.
They have ger@@ m@@ plas@@ m alive and things that you've never eat@@ en.
I am the only person in this room that's eaten that kind of to@@ mat@@ o.
Pro@@ bl@@ em is it was a sau@@ ce toma@@ to and we don't know how to co@@ ok, so we ate a sau@@ ce toma@@ to, which is not that great.
But we've done things with protein - we've grown all kinds of things.
We've grown humans - Well maybe you could, but we didn't.
But what we realized is, the tool was too big, it was too expensive.
I was starting to put them around the world and they were about 100,000 dollars.
F@@ inding somebody with 100 grand in their back pocket isn't easy, so we wanted to make a small one.
This project was actually one of my student@@ 's - mechanical engineering under@@ gradu@@ ate, Cam@@ il@@ le.
So Cam@@ il@@ le and I and my team, we iter@@ ated all summer, how to make it cheaper@@ , how to make it work better, how to make it so other people can make it.
Then we dropped them off in schools, seventh through el@@ event@@ h grade.
And if you want to be hum@@ ble@@ d, try to teach a kid something.
So I went into this school and I said, "S@@ et it to 65 percent hum@@ id@@ ity."
The seventh grad@@ er said, "What's hum@@ id@@ it@@ y?"
And I said, "Oh, it's water in air@@ ."
He said, "There's no water in air, you're an idi@@ ot@@ ."
And I was like, "Al@@ right, don't trust me. Actually - don't trust me, right? S@@ et it to 100.
He sets it to 100 and what happens?
It starts to conden@@ se, make a fo@@ g and eventually dri@@ p.
And he says, "O@@ h. Hum@@ id@@ ity is rain@@ .
Why didn't you just tell me that?"
We've created an interface for this that's much like a game.
They have a 3D environment, they can log into it anywhere in the world on their smart@@ phone, on their table@@ t.
They have different parts of the bo@@ ts - the physic@@ al, the sensor@@ s.
They select re@@ cip@@ es that have been created by other kids anywhere in the world.
They select and activate that reci@@ pe, they plant a se@@ ed@@ ling.
While it's grow@@ ing, they make changes.
They're like, "Why does a plant need CO2 any@@ way? Isn't CO2 bad@@ ? It kills people@@ ."
Cr@@ ank up CO2, plant di@@ es.
Or cr@@ ank down CO2, plant does very well.
Harv@@ est plant, and you've created a new digital reci@@ pe.
It's an iter@@ ative design and development and exploration process.
They can down@@ lo@@ ad, then, all of the data about that new plant that they developed or the new digital recipe and what did it do - was it better or was it wor@@ se?
Imagine these as little cores of process@@ ing.
We're going to learn so much.
Here's one of the food computers, as we call them, in a school in three week@@ s' time.
This is three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it was the first time that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer - or that he would want to be a far@@ mer.
So, we've open-@@ sourc@@ ed all of this.
It's all onlin@@ e; go home, try to build your first food computer. It's going to be difficult - I'm just telling you.
We're in the beginning, but it's all there.
It's very important to me that this is easily access@@ ible. We're going to keep making it more so.
These are farmers, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, environmental engineer, computer scientist, plant scientist, econom@@ ist, urban plan@@ ners.
On one plat@@ form, doing what they're good at.
But we got a little too big.
This is my new facility that I'm just star@@ ting.
This ware@@ house could be anywhere.
That's why I chose it.
And inside of this ware@@ house we're going to build something kind of like this.
These exist right now.
Take a look at it.
These exist, too.
One grows gre@@ ens, one grows Ebola vaccin@@ e.
Pretty amazing that plants and this DAR@@ PA Grand Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge winner is one of the reasons we're getting ahead of E@@ bola.
The plants are producing the protein that's Ebola resist@@ ant.
So pharmaceu@@ tic@@ als, nu@@ tr@@ ace@@ u@@ tic@@ als, all they way down to let@@ tu@@ ce.
But these two things look nothing ali@@ ke, and that's where I am with my field.
Everything is different.
We're in that weird "We're al@@ right@@ " stage and it's like, "@@ Here's my black box -" "No, buy min@@ e."
"No, no, no - I've got intellectual property that's totally valu@@ able.
Don't buy h@@ is, buy min@@ e."
And the reality is, we're just at the beginning, in a time when society is shif@@ ting, too.
When we ask for more, cheaper food, we're now asking for better, environment@@ ally friendly food.
And when you have McDonald's advertising what's in the Ch@@ ick@@ en Mc@@ N@@ ug@@ get, the most mysterious food item of all time - they are now bas@@ ing their marketing plan on that - everything is changing.
So into the world now.
Person@@ al food computers, food ser@@ vers and food data centers run on the open ph@@ eno@@ me.
Think open genome, but we're going to put little climate re@@ cip@@ es, like Wikipedia, that you can pull down, actu@@ ate and grow.
What does this look like in a world?
You remember the world connected by str@@ ing@@ s?
We start having be@@ acon@@ s.
We start sending information about food, rather than sending food.
This is not just my fantas@@ y, this is where we're already deplo@@ ying.
Fo@@ od computers, food ser@@ vers, soon@@ -to-@@ be food data centers, connecting people together to share information.
The future of food is not about fighting over what's wrong with this.
We know what's wrong with this.
The future of food is about networking the next one billion farmers and empowering them with a platform to ask and answer the question, "What if@@ ?"
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: A million refugees arrived in Europe this year, says Alexander Bet@@ ts, and "@@ our response, frankly, has been pa@@ the@@ tic@@ ." Bet@@ ts studies forced migr@@ ation, the impossible choice for families between the camp@@ s, urban poverty and dangerous illegal journe@@ ys to saf@@ ety. In this ins@@ ight@@ ful talk, he offers four ways to change the way we treat refuge@@ es, so they can make an immediate contribution to their new homes. "There's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost@@ ," Bet@@ ts say@@ s. "@@ They're human beings with skills, tal@@ ents, aspir@@ ations, with the ability to make contribu@@ tions - if we let them."
Alexander Bet@@ ts: Our refugee system is fail@@ ing. Here's how we can fix it.
There are times when I feel really quite ash@@ amed to be a Europe@@ an.
In the last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, has been pa@@ the@@ tic.
There are just so many contradic@@ tions.
We m@@ our@@ n the tragic death of two-@@ year-old Alan Kur@@ di, and yet, since then, more than 200 children have subsequ@@ ently dro@@ wn@@ ed in the Mediterr@@ ane@@ an.
We have international tre@@ ati@@ es that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility, and yet we accept that tiny Leban@@ on hos@@ ts more Sy@@ ri@@ ans than the whole of Europe combined.
We lam@@ ent the existence of human smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers, and yet we make that the only vi@@ able route to seek as@@ yl@@ um in Europe.
We have labor shor@@ tag@@ es, and yet we exclu@@ de people who fit our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We proc@@ la@@ im our liberal values in op@@ position to fundament@@ alist Isl@@ am, and yet - we have re@@ press@@ ive policies that de@@ tain child as@@ yl@@ um see@@ k@@ ers, that separate children from their families, and that se@@ ize property from refuge@@ es.
What are we doing?
How has the situation come to this, that we've adopted such an inh@@ um@@ ane response to a humanitarian cris@@ is?
I don't believe it's because people don't care, or at least I don't want to believe it's because people don't care.
I believe it's because our politicians lack a vision, a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system created over 50 years ago for a changing and glob@@ alized world.
And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two really fundamental questions, the two questions we all need to ask.
First, why is the current system not work@@ ing?
And second, what can we do to fix it?
So the modern refugee regime was created in the after@@ math of the Second World War by these guys.
Its basic aim is to ensure that when a state fail@@ s, or worse, turns against its own people, people have somewhere to go, to live in safety and dignity until they can go home.
It was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Sy@@ ria today.
Through an international conv@@ ention signed by 14@@ 7 governments, the 195@@ 1 Con@@ v@@ ention on the Stat@@ us of Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es, and an international organization, UN@@ H@@ C@@ R, states committed to reciproc@@ ally admit people onto their territory who fle@@ e conflict and per@@ se@@ cu@@ tion.
But today, that system is fail@@ ing.
In theory, refugees have a right to seek as@@ yl@@ um.
In practice, our immigr@@ ation policies block the path to saf@@ ety.
In theory, refugees have a right to a path@@ way to integr@@ ation, or return to the country they've come from.
But in practice, they get stuck in almost indefin@@ ite lim@@ b@@ o.
In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility.
In practice, geo@@ graphy means that countries pro@@ xi@@ mate the conflict take the overwhelming majority of the world's refuge@@ es.
The system isn't broken because the rules are wrong.
It's that we're not applying them adequ@@ ately to a changing world, and that's what we need to re@@ consid@@ er.
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works.
How does the refugee regime actually work?
But not from a top-@@ down institutional perspective, rather from the perspective of a refuge@@ e.
So imagine a Sy@@ ri@@ an woman.
Let's call her A@@ mir@@ a.
And Am@@ ira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region.
A@@ mir@@ a, like around 25 percent of the world's refuge@@ es, is a woman with children, and she can't go home because she comes from this city that you see before you, Hom@@ s, a once beautiful and historic city now under rub@@ ble.
And so Am@@ ira can't go back there.
But Am@@ ira also has no hope of res@@ et@@ t@@ le@@ ment to a third country, because that's a lot@@ tery ticket only available to less than one percent of the world's refuge@@ es.
So Am@@ ira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three basic options.
The first option is that Am@@ ira can take her family to a cam@@ p.
In the cam@@ p, she might get assist@@ ance, but there are very few prospec@@ ts for Am@@ ira and her family.
Cam@@ ps are in ble@@ ak, ari@@ d loc@@ ations, often in the desert.
In the Z@@ a@@ at@@ ari refugee camp in Jord@@ an, you can hear the sh@@ ells across the border in Sy@@ ria at night@@ time.
There's restric@@ ted economic activity.
Educa@@ tion is often of poor quality.
And around the world, some 80 percent of refugees who are in cam@@ ps have to stay for at least five years.
It's a miserable existence, and that's probably why, in reality, only nine percent of Sy@@ ri@@ ans choose that option.
Al@@ tern@@ ati@@ vely, Am@@ ira can head to an urban area in a neighbor@@ ing country, like Am@@ man or B@@ eir@@ ut.
That's an option that about 75 percent of Sy@@ ri@@ an refugees have tak@@ en.
But there, there's great difficulty as well.
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es in such urban areas don't usually have the right to work.
They don't usually get significant access to assist@@ ance.
And so when Am@@ ira and her family have used up their basic sav@@ ings, they're left with very little and likely to face urban des@@ titu@@ tion.
So there's a third altern@@ ative, and it's one that increasing numbers of Sy@@ ri@@ ans are ta@@ king.
Am@@ ira can seek some hope for her family by ris@@ king their lives on a dangerous and per@@ il@@ ous journey to another country, and it's that which we're seeing in Europe today.
Around the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice between three op@@ tion@@ s: en@@ camp@@ ment, urban des@@ titu@@ tion and dangerous journe@@ ys.
For refuge@@ es, that choice is the global refugee regime today.
But I think it's a false choice.
I think we can re@@ consider that choice.
The reason why we limit those options is because we think that those are the only options that are available to refuge@@ es, and they're not.
Pol@@ iti@@ ci@@ ans frame the issue as a zero-sum issue, that if we benefit refuge@@ es, we're impos@@ ing costs on citizens.
We tend to have a collective assumption that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society.
But they don't have to. They can contribu@@ te.
So what I want to argue is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set and still benefit everyone else@@ : the host states and communities, our societies and refugees themselves.
And I want to suggest four ways we can transform the paradigm of how we think about refuge@@ es.
All four ways have one thing in common@@ : they're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globaliz@@ ation, mobility and markets, and update the way we think about the refugee issue.
The first one I want to think about is the idea of enabling environment@@ s, and it starts from a very basic recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but they're just in extraordinary circumstances.
Toge@@ ther with my colleagues in Oxford, we've embar@@ ked on a research project in Uganda looking at the economic lives of refuge@@ es.
We chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries.
It's not. It's excep@@ tion@@ al.
Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunity.
It gives them the right to work. It gives them freedom of movement.
And the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community.
In the capital city, Kam@@ pal@@ a, we found that 21 percent of refugees own a business that emplo@@ ys other people, and 40 percent of those employees are nation@@ als of the host country.
In other words, refugees are making jobs for citizens of the host country.
Even in the camp@@ s, we found extraordinary examples of vibr@@ ant, flour@@ ishing and entrepreneurial businesses.
For example, in a settle@@ ment called N@@ ak@@ i@@ val@@ e, we found examples of Con@@ gol@@ ese refugees running digital music exchange businesses.
We found a Rwand@@ an who runs a business that's available to allow the youth to play computer games on recycled games con@@ so@@ les and recycled televis@@ ions.
Ag@@ ain@@ st the odds of extreme constrain@@ t, refugees are innov@@ ating, and the gentleman you see before you is a Con@@ gol@@ ese guy called Dem@@ ou@@ -@@ K@@ ay.
Dem@@ ou@@ -@@ K@@ ay arrived in the settle@@ ment with very little, but he wanted to be a film@@ maker.
So with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he r@@ ented a video camera, and he's now making film@@ s.
He made two documentary films with and for our team, and he's making a successful business out of very little.
It's those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refuge@@ es.
Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assist@@ ance, we need to provide them with opportunities for human flour@@ ish@@ ing.
Yes, clothes, blank@@ ets, shel@@ ter, food are all important in the emergency phas@@ e, but we need to also look beyond that.
We need to provide opportunities to connec@@ tivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and ban@@ king.
All the ways in which we take for granted that we are plug@@ ged in to the global economy can and should apply to refuge@@ es.
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zon@@ es.
Unfortunately, not every host country in the world takes the approach Uganda has tak@@ en.
Most host countries don't open up their economies to refugees in the same way.
But there are still prag@@ matic alternative options that we can use.
Last Apr@@ il, I traveled to Jord@@ an with my colleagu@@ e, the development economist Paul Col@@ li@@ er, and we brainstor@@ med an idea while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to bring jobs to Sy@@ ri@@ ans while supporting Jord@@ an's national development strategy.
The idea is for an economic zone, one in which we could potentially integrate the employ@@ ment of refugees alongside the employ@@ ment of Jord@@ ani@@ an host nation@@ als.
And just 15 minutes away from the Z@@ a@@ at@@ ari refugee cam@@ p, home to 8@@ 3,000 refuge@@ es, is an existing economic zone called the King Hus@@ se@@ in B@@ in Tal@@ al Development Are@@ a.
The government has spent over a hundred million dollars connecting it to the electricity grid, connecting it to the road network, but it lac@@ ked two things: access to labor and in@@ ward invest@@ ment.
So what if refugees were able to work there rather than being stuck in camp@@ s, able to support their families and develop skills through voc@@ ational training before they go back to Sy@@ ri@@ a?
We recognized that that could benefit Jord@@ an, whose development strategy requires it to make the leap as a middle income country to manufactur@@ ing.
It could benefit refuge@@ es, but it could also contribute to the post@@ conflict re@@ construction of Sy@@ ria by recognizing that we need to incub@@ ate refugees as the best source of eventually re@@ building Sy@@ ria.
We published the idea in the journal For@@ e@@ ign Af@@ fair@@ s.
King Ab@@ dul@@ la@@ h has picked up on the idea.
It was announced at the London Sy@@ ria Confer@@ ence two weeks ago, and a pilot will begin in the summer.
The third idea that I want to put to you is prefer@@ ence mat@@ ching between states and refugees to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the sel@@ fi@@ e featur@@ ing Ang@@ ela Mer@@ k@@ el and a Sy@@ ri@@ an refuge@@ e.
What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but I'd argue we can do that and still make everyone better off.
The economist Al@@ vin Ro@@ th has developed the idea of mat@@ ching markets, ways in which the prefer@@ ence ran@@ king of the parties shapes an event@@ ual mat@@ ch.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex T@@ ey@@ tel@@ boy@@ m have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refuge@@ es, to ask refugees to r@@ ank their prefer@@ red destin@@ ations, but also allow states to r@@ ank the types of refugees they want on skills crit@@ eria or language crit@@ eria and allow those to mat@@ ch.
Now, of course you'd need to build in quo@@ tas on things like diversity and vulner@@ ability, but it's a way of increasing the possibilities of match@@ ing.
The mat@@ ching idea has been successfully used to mat@@ ch, for instance, students with university places, to match kidney don@@ ors with patients, and it under@@ lies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating web@@ sites.
So why not apply that to give refugees greater cho@@ ic@@ e?
It could also be used at the national level, where one of the great challenges we face is to persuade local communities to accept refuge@@ es.
And at the moment, in my country, for instance, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities, which makes no sense at all.
So mat@@ ching markets offer a potential way to bring those prefer@@ ences together and listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host and the refugees themselves.
The fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian vis@@ as.
Mu@@ ch of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe was entirely avoid@@ able.
It s@@ tem@@ s from a fundamental contradic@@ tion in Europe@@ 's as@@ yl@@ um policy, which is the follow@@ ing: that in order to seek as@@ yl@@ um in Europe, you have to arrive spontane@@ ously by embar@@ king on those dangerous journe@@ ys that I descri@@ bed.
But why should those journe@@ ys be necessary in an era of the budget airline and modern cons@@ ular cap@@ abil@@ iti@@ es?
They're completely un@@ necessary journe@@ ys, and last year, they led to the deaths of over 3,000 people on Europe@@ 's borders and within European territor@@ y.
If refugees were simply allowed to travel directly and seek as@@ yl@@ um in Europe, and there's a way of doing that through something called a humanitarian vis@@ a, that allows people to collect a vis@@ a at an emb@@ ass@@ y or a consul@@ ate in a neighbor@@ ing country and then simply pay their own way through a ferr@@ y or a flight to Europe.
It costs around a thousand eur@@ os to take a smu@@ g@@ gl@@ er from Turkey to the Greek is@@ lands.
It costs 200 eur@@ os to take a budget airline from B@@ od@@ r@@ um to Frank@@ fur@@ t.
If we allowed refugees to do that, it would have major advant@@ ages.
It would save lives, it would under@@ cut the entire market for smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers, and it would remove the chaos we see from Europe@@ 's front line in areas like the Greek is@@ lands.
It's politics that prev@@ ents us doing that rather than a rational solution.
And this is an idea that has been appli@@ ed.
Brazil has adopted a pione@@ ering approach where over 2,000 Sy@@ ri@@ ans have been able to get humanitarian vis@@ as, enter Brazil, and claim refugee status on arri@@ val in Brazil.
And in that sche@@ me, every Sy@@ ri@@ an who has gone through it has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refuge@@ e.
There is a historical preced@@ ent for it as well.
Bet@@ we@@ en 19@@ 22 and 194@@ 2, these Nan@@ sen pass@@ port@@ s were used as travel documents to allow 4@@ 50,000 As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans, Tur@@ ks and Chech@@ ens to travel across Europe and claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
And the Nan@@ sen International Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e Office received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this being a vi@@ able strategy.
So all four of these ideas that I've presented you are ways in which we can expand A@@ mir@@ a's choice set.
They're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees beyond those basic@@ , impossible three options and still leave others better off.
In conclus@@ ion, we really need a new vision, a vision that en@@ larg@@ es the choices of refugees but recognizes that they don't have to be a bur@@ den.
There's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they're human beings with skills, tal@@ ents, aspir@@ ations, with the ability to make contribu@@ tions - if we let them.
In the new world, migr@@ ation is not going to go away.
What we've seen in Europe will be with us for many years.
People will continue to travel, they'll continue to be dis@@ plac@@ ed, and we need to find ration@@ al, realistic ways of managing this - not based on the old log@@ ics of humanitarian assist@@ ance, not based on log@@ ics of char@@ ity, but building on the opportunities offered by globaliz@@ ation, markets and mobil@@ ity.
I'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Som@@ er@@ sa@@ ul@@ ting mant@@ a r@@ ays, d@@ ashing dolph@@ ins, s@@ warming schools of fish and mun@@ ching sharks inhab@@ it a world beneath the oce@@ an's surface that few get a chance to see. Conserv@@ ation photographer Thomas P@@ es@@ ch@@ ak vis@@ its incredible seas@@ cap@@ es around the world, and his photos reveal these hidden eco@@ systems. "You can't love something and become a cham@@ pi@@ on for it if you don't know it exist@@ s," he say@@ s. Jo@@ in P@@ es@@ ch@@ ak in a new, immer@@ sive TED Talk format as he shares his stunning work and his dream for a future of respec@@ tful co@@ existence with the ocean.
Thomas P@@ es@@ ch@@ ak@@ : D@@ ive into an ocean photograp@@ her@@ 's world.
As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.
It was this wild place full of color and life, home to these alien@@ -@@ looking, fantas@@ tical creatures.
I pic@@ tured big sharks rul@@ ing the food chain and saw gr@@ ace@@ ful sea tur@@ t@@ les dancing across coral reef@@ s.
As a marine biologist turned photograp@@ her, I've spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those I used to dream about when I was little.
As you can see, I began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age.
But the first time I truly went under@@ water, I was about 10 years old.
And I can still vi@@ vid@@ ly remember furi@@ ously fin@@ ning to reach this old, en@@ crus@@ ted can@@ no@@ n on a sh@@ allow coral reef@@ .
And when I finally managed to grab hold of it, I looked up, and I was instantly surrounded by fish in all colors of the rain@@ bo@@ w.
That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas P@@ es@@ ch@@ ak Conserv@@ ation Pho@@ to@@ grapher In my 40 years on this planet, I've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seas@@ cap@@ es for National Geographic Magaz@@ ine and the S@@ ave Our Se@@ as Found@@ ation.
I've photographed everything from really, really big sharks to d@@ ain@@ ty ones that fit in the palm of your hand.
I've smel@@ led the fish@@ y, fish@@ y breath of hum@@ p@@ back whales feeding just feet away from me in the cold seas off Canad@@ a's Great Be@@ ar Rain@@ forest.
And I've been priv@@ y to the mating ritu@@ als of green sea tur@@ t@@ les in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que Chan@@ nel@@ .
Everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean.
And the pr@@ istine seas I used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find.
They are becoming more com@@ pressed and more threaten@@ ed.
As we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predat@@ or on ear@@ th, I've witnessed and photographed many of these ri@@ p@@ ple effects fir@@ s@@ th@@ and.
For a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience out of their in@@ difference with disturbing images.
And while this approach has mer@@ its, I have come full circle.
I believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love.
I guess I'm a match@@ maker of sorts and as a photograp@@ her, I have the rare opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems that lie hidden beneath the oce@@ an's surface.
You can't love something and become a cham@@ pi@@ on for it if you don't know it exist@@ s.
Un@@ covering this - that is the power of conservation photograph@@ y.
I've visited hundreds of marine loc@@ ations, but there are a handful of seas@@ cap@@ es that have touched me incredibly dee@@ pl@@ y.
The first time I experienced that kind of high was about 10 years ago, off South Africa's rug@@ g@@ ed, wild coas@@ t.
And every June and Jul@@ y, enormous sho@@ als of sar@@ din@@ es travel nor@@ th@@ wards in a mass migr@@ ation we call the Sar@@ d@@ ine R@@ un@@ .
And boy, do those fish have good reason to run.
In hot pursuit are ho@@ ards of hungry and ag@@ ile predat@@ ors.
Com@@ mon dolphins hunt together and they can separate some of the sar@@ din@@ es from the main sho@@ al and they create ba@@ it ball@@ s.
They drive and tra@@ p the fish up@@ ward against the ocean surface and then they rush in to d@@ ine on this puls@@ ating and mov@@ able fe@@ ast.
C@@ lose behind are sharks.
Now, most people believe that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enem@@ ies, but during the Sar@@ d@@ ine R@@ un@@ , they actually co@@ exist.
In fact, dolphins actually help sharks feed more effec@@ tively.
Without dolph@@ ins, the ba@@ it balls are more disper@@ sed and sharks often end up with what I call a s@@ ard@@ ine don@@ ut, or a mouth full of water.
Now, while I've had a few s@@ pic@@ y moments with sharks on the s@@ ard@@ ine run, I know they don't see me as pre@@ y.
However, I get bum@@ ped and tail-@@ s@@ lap@@ ped just like any other gu@@ est at this ro@@ w@@ dy, ro@@ w@@ dy banqu@@ et.
From the sh@@ ores of Africa we travel eas@@ t, across the v@@ ast@@ ness that is the Indian Ocean to the Maldiv@@ es, an archi@@ pel@@ ago of coral is@@ lands.
And during the stor@@ my sou@@ thwest mon@@ soon, mant@@ a rays from all across the archi@@ pel@@ ago travel to a tiny spec@@ k in Ba@@ a At@@ oll called H@@ ani@@ far@@ u.
Ar@@ mi@@ es of cr@@ ust@@ ace@@ ans, most no bigger than the size of your pup@@ ils, are the mainst@@ ay of the mant@@ a r@@ ay@@ 's di@@ et.
When plank@@ ton concentr@@ ations become pat@@ ch@@ y, mant@@ a rays feed alone and they so@@ mer@@ sa@@ ul@@ t themselves backwards again and again, very much like a pup@@ py chasing its own tail.
However, when plank@@ ton den@@ si@@ ties increas@@ e, the mant@@ as line up head@@ -to-@@ tail to form these long feeding chain@@ s, and any tas@@ ty mor@@ sel that escap@@ es the first or second mant@@ a in line is surely to be go@@ b@@ bled up by the next or the one after.
As plank@@ ton levels peak in the ba@@ y, the mant@@ as swim closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cycl@@ one feed@@ ing.
And as they sw@@ ir@@ l in tight forma@@ tion, this multi-@@ step column of mant@@ as creates its own vor@@ tex, suc@@ king in and delivering the plank@@ ton right into the mant@@ as@@ ' cavern@@ ous mouth@@ s.
The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly un@@ for@@ get@@ table.
When I first photographed H@@ ani@@ far@@ u, the site enjoyed no protection and was threatened by development.
And working with NGOs like the M@@ anta Tr@@ ust, my images eventually helped H@@ ani@@ far@@ u become a marin@@ e-@@ protected area.
Now, fisher@@ man from neighbor@@ ing is@@ lands, they once hun@@ ted these mant@@ a rays to make traditional dr@@ ums from their skin@@ s.
Today, they are the most ard@@ ent conservation cham@@ p@@ ions and mant@@ a rays earn the Mal@@ di@@ vian economy in exc@@ ess of 8 million dollars every single year.
I have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read, "There be dragon@@ s."
And today, the closest I've come is visiting remote at@@ ol@@ ls in the western Indian Oce@@ an.
F@@ ar, far away from shipping lan@@ es and fishing fle@@ ets, diving into these waters is a po@@ ign@@ ant remin@@ der of what our oceans once looked like.
Very few people have heard of B@@ ass@@ as da India, a tiny spec@@ k of coral in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que Chan@@ nel@@ .
Its reef forms a protective outer barrier and the inner lago@@ on is a nur@@ ser@@ y ground for Galapag@@ os sharks.
These sharks are anything but sh@@ y, even during the day.
I had a bit of a h@@ unch that they'd be even bol@@ der and more abundant at night.
Never before have I encountered so many sharks on a single coral out@@ cro@@ p.
Cap@@ turing and sharing moments like this - that reminds me why I chose my path.
Ear@@ li@@ er this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic Magaz@@ ine in B@@ aja California.
And about halfway down the pen@@ insul@@ a on the Pacific side lies San Ig@@ nac@@ io Lag@@ o@@ on, a critical cal@@ ving ground for gray whal@@ es.
For 100 years, this coast was the scene of a whol@@ es@@ ale slaugh@@ ter, where more than 20,000 gray whales were killed, leaving only a few hundred surviv@@ ors.
Today the descend@@ ents of these same whales nud@@ ge their youn@@ g@@ sters to the surface to play and even interact with us.
This species truly has made a remarkable come@@ back.
Now, on the other side of the pen@@ insul@@ a lies Cab@@ o Pul@@ mo, a sleep@@ y fishing village.
Dec@@ ades of over@@ fishing had brought them close to collapse.
In 1995, local fisher@@ man convinced the authorities to proc@@ la@@ im their waters a marine reser@@ ve.
But what happened next was nothing short of miracul@@ ous.
In 2005, after only a single decade of protec@@ tion, scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recor@@ ded.
But don't take my word for it - come with me.
On a single breath, swim with me in deep, into one of the largest and dens@@ est schools of fish I have ever en@@ counter@@ ed.
We all have the ability to be cre@@ ators of hope.
And through my photograph@@ y, I want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans.
And particular@@ ly, I want to focus on nature's resilience in the face of 7.@@ 3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will have to search much, much harder to make photographs like this, while creating images that show@@ case our respec@@ tful co@@ existence with the ocean.
Those will hopefully become an everyday occurr@@ ence for me.
To thri@@ ve and survive in my profess@@ ion, you really have to be a hopel@@ ess optim@@ ist.
And I always operate on the assumption that the next great picture that will effect change is right around the corner, behind the next coral head, inside the next lago@@ on or possi@@ bly, in the one after it.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In Zimbab@@ we in the 198@@ 0s, Mary Bas@@ set@@ t witnessed the AIDS epidemic fir@@ s@@ th@@ and, and she helped set up a clinic to treat and educate local people about the deadly virus. But looking back, she regre@@ ts not s@@ ounding the alarm for the real problem: the structural in@@ equi@@ ties embedded in the world's political and economic organizations, in@@ equi@@ ties that make margin@@ alized people more vulner@@ able. These same structural problems exist in the United States today, and as New York C@@ it@@ y's Health Com@@ mission@@ er, Bas@@ set@@ t is using every chance she has to r@@ ally support for health equ@@ ity and speak out against rac@@ ism. "We don't have to have all the answers to call for chan@@ ge@@ ," she say@@ s. "We just need cour@@ ag@@ e."
Mary Bas@@ set@@ t: Why your doctor should care about social justice.
When I moved to Har@@ are in 1985, social justice was at the core of Zimbab@@ we@@ 's national health policy.
The new government emerged from a long war of independ@@ ence and immediately proc@@ la@@ i@@ med a soci@@ alist agend@@ a: health care services, primary education became essentially free.
A massive expansion of rural health centers placed roughly 80 percent of the population less than a two-@@ hour walk from these facil@@ ities, a truly remarkable accomplish@@ ment.
In 1980, the year of independ@@ ence, 25 percent of Zimbab@@ we@@ an children were fully immun@@ iz@@ ed.
By 1990, a mere decade later, this proportion stood at 80 percent.
I felt tremend@@ ously privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution.
The excitem@@ ent, the camar@@ ad@@ eri@@ e, was palp@@ able.
Wor@@ king side by side with brilliant Zimbab@@ we@@ ans - scientists, doctors, activists - I felt connected not only to an African independ@@ ence movement, but to a global progress@@ ive public health movement.
But there were da@@ un@@ ting challenges.
Zimbab@@ we reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arri@@ ved.
I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 198@@ 0s, when I did my medical training at Har@@ lem Hos@@ pit@@ al, but - we had no idea what lay in store for Africa.
In@@ fec@@ tion rate stood at about two percent in my early days there.
These would soar to one out of every four adults by the time I left Har@@ are 17 years later.
By the mid-@@ 1990s, I'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life that they were HIV-@@ positive.
I saw colleagues and friends die, my students, hospital patients, die.
In response, my colleagues and I set up a clin@@ ic.
We did con@@ dom demonstr@@ ations.
We launched school education and work@@ place interven@@ tions.
We did research. We counsel@@ ed the partners of infected men about how to protect themselves.
We worked hard, and at the time, I believed that I was doing my best.
I was providing excellent treatment, such as it was.
But I was not talking about structural change.
For@@ mer U@@ N Secre@@ tary K@@ of@@ i Ann@@ an has spoken candid@@ ly about his personal failure leading to the Rwand@@ an genocid@@ e.
In 1994, he was head of the U@@ N peace@@ keeping depart@@ ment.
At a 10@@ -year memor@@ ial for the genocid@@ e, he reflec@@ ted, "I believed at the time I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that there was more I could and should have done to sound the alarm and r@@ ally support@@ ."
The AIDS epidemic caught the health community un@@ prepar@@ ed, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease, I'm not alone in feeling remor@@ se and regret at not having done more earlier.
But while living in Zimbab@@ we, I didn't see my role as an advoc@@ acy or a political one.
I was there for my technical skills, both my clinical and my research epidemi@@ ology skills.
And in my mind, my job was to take care of patients and to do research to better understand the population patterns of trans@@ mission, and I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that socially margin@@ alized populations were at dis@@ proportion@@ ate risk of getting and dying of AIDS.
And on the sugar plant@@ ations, which really more closely res@@ emb@@ led fe@@ ud@@ al fi@@ ef@@ doms than any modern enterpris@@ e, 60 percent of pregnant women tested HIV-@@ positive.
I worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure but instead related to a culture of male superi@@ or@@ ity, to forced migr@@ ant labor and to colon@@ i@@ alism.
Whi@@ tes were largely un@@ s@@ cathe@@ d.
As health profession@@ als, our tools were pi@@ ti@@ fully weak@@ : implor@@ ing people to change their individual behavi@@ ors, use con@@ dom@@ s, reduce number of partner@@ s.
In@@ fec@@ tion rates clim@@ bed, and when treatment became available in the West, treatment that remains our most potent weapon against this virus, it was un@@ affordable to the public sector across Africa.
I didn't speak out about the un@@ equal access to these life-@@ saving drugs or about the underlying economic and political systems that were driving infec@@ tion rates in such huge swa@@ ths of the population.
I ration@@ alized my silence by remin@@ ding myself that I was a gu@@ est in the country, that s@@ ounding the alarm could even get me kicked out, keep me from doing good work, taking care of my patients, doing much@@ -@@ needed research.
So I didn't speak out about the government@@ 's early st@@ ance on AIDS.
I didn't voice my concerns lou@@ dly enough.
Many doctors, health profession@@ als, may think I did nothing wrong.
Our pac@@ t with our patients, the Hi@@ pp@@ ocr@@ atic O@@ ath and its vari@@ ants, is about the sanc@@ tit@@ y of the patient@@ -@@ doctor relationship.
And I did everything I could for each and every patient of mine.
But I knew that epidem@@ ics emerge along the f@@ issu@@ res of our society, reflec@@ ting not only biology, but more importantly patterns of margin@@ aliz@@ ation, exclus@@ ion, discrimin@@ ation related to race, gend@@ er, sexual@@ ity, class and more.
It was true of AIDS.
It was true just recently of E@@ bola.
Medical anthrop@@ ologists such as Paul Far@@ mer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, call this structural viol@@ ence: structural because in@@ equi@@ ties are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, often in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power@@ ; and violence because its impact - prema@@ ture death@@ s, suffering, illness - is viol@@ ent.
We do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social in@@ justic@@ es.
S@@ ounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right, and it's how we may r@@ ally support to break through and create real change together.
So these days, I'm not staying qui@@ et.
I'm speaking up about a lot of things, even when it makes listen@@ ers uncomfort@@ able, even when it makes me uncomfort@@ able.
And a lot of this is about racial dispar@@ ities and institu@@ tion@@ alized rac@@ ism, things that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore, certainly not in the practice of medicine or public health.
But we have them, and we pay for them in lives cut shor@@ t.
That's why s@@ ounding the alarm about the impact of rac@@ ism on health in the United States, the ongoing institutional and inter@@ personal violence that people of color face, comp@@ ounded by our tragic legacy of 250 years of slaver@@ y, 90 years of Jim C@@ row and 60 years of im@@ perfect equal@@ ity, s@@ ounding the alarm about this is central to doing my job right as New York C@@ it@@ y's Health Com@@ mission@@ er.
In New York City, prema@@ ture mortality - that's death before the age of 65 - is 50 percent higher for black men than white ones.
A black woman in 20@@ 12 faced more than 10 times the risk of dying related to child@@ birth as a white woman.
And though we've made enormous str@@ ides in reducing infant mortality r@@ ates, a black baby still faces nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life as compared to a white baby.
New York C@@ it@@ y's not excep@@ tion@@ al.
These statistics are parall@@ eled by statistics found across the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are 1.5 million missing black men across the country.
They no@@ ted that more than one out of every six black men who today should be between the ages of 25 and 5@@ 4 years have disappeared from daily life, lost either to prison or prema@@ ture death.
There is great in@@ justice in the daily and dis@@ proportion@@ ate violence faced by young black men, the focus of recent protests under the ban@@ ner #@@ Black@@ Liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter.
But we have to remember that endur@@ ing and dispar@@ ate rates and the occurr@@ ence and outcome of common medical conditions - heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV - diseases that may kill slowly and quiet@@ ly and take even more black lives prema@@ tu@@ rel@@ y.
As the #@@ Black@@ Liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter movement un@@ fol@@ ded, I felt frustrated and angry that the medical community has been re@@ luct@@ ant to even use the word "@@ rac@@ ism@@ " in our research and our work.
You've probably felt something every time I've said it.
Our medical students held di@@ e-@@ ins in their white co@@ ats, but the medical community has largely stood by passi@@ vely as ongoing discrimin@@ ation continues to affect the disease profile and mortal@@ ity.
And I worry that the trend towards personalized and precis@@ ion medicine, looking for biological or genetic targets to better tail@@ or treatment, may in@@ adver@@ tent@@ ly cause us to lose sight of the big picture, that it is the daily context, where a person lives, grow@@ s, works, lo@@ ves, that most importantly determines population health, and for too many of us, poor health.
As health professionals in our daily work, whether in the clinic or doing research, we are witness to great in@@ justic@@ e: the homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice because he has more pressing prioriti@@ es; the trans@@ gender youth who is contempl@@ ating suicide because our society is just so har@@ sh@@ ; the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible for the poor health of her child.
Our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and advocate for change.
Righ@@ t@@ fully or not, our societal position gives our voices great credi@@ bil@@ ity, and we shouldn't waste that.
I regret not speaking up in Zimbab@@ we, and I've promised myself that as New York C@@ it@@ y's Health Com@@ mission@@ er, I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and r@@ ally support for health equ@@ ity.
I will speak out against rac@@ ism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you speak out against sex@@ ism or any other form of inequality.
It's time for us to rise up and collectively speak up about structural inequality.
We don't have to have all the answers to call for change.
We just need cour@@ age.
The health of our patients, the health of us all, depends on it.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When your job h@@ ing@@ es on how well you talk to people, you learn a lot about how to have conversations - and that most of us don't conver@@ se very well. Cel@@ este He@@ ad@@ le@@ e has worked as a radio host for decades, and she knows the ingredients of a great convers@@ ation: Hon@@ est@@ y, brev@@ ity, clar@@ ity and a healthy amount of listening. In this ins@@ ight@@ ful talk, she shares 10 useful rules for having better convers@@ ations. "G@@ o out, talk to people, listen to people@@ ," she say@@ s. "@@ And, most importantly, be prepared to be amaz@@ ed."
Cel@@ este He@@ ad@@ le@@ e: 10 ways to have a better conversation.
All right, I want to see a show of hand@@ s: how many of you have un@@ fri@@ ended someone on Facebook because they said something off@@ ensive about politics or religion, child@@ care, food@@ ?
And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them?
You know, it used to be that in order to have a pol@@ ite conversation, we just had to follow the advice of Henry Hig@@ g@@ ins in "My F@@ air Lad@@ y@@ ": S@@ tic@@ k to the weather and your health.
But these days, with climate change and anti-@@ v@@ ax@@ x@@ ing, those subjects - are not safe either.
So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to devol@@ ve into an argument@@ , where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passion@@ ately for it and against it, it's not normal.
Pe@@ w Research did a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polariz@@ ed, we are more divid@@ ed, than we ever have been in history.
We're less likely to compromis@@ e, which means we're not listening to each other.
And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe.
Again, that means we're not listening to each other.
A conversation requires a balance between talking and listen@@ ing, and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.
Now, part of that is due to technology.
The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly.
According to Pe@@ w Resear@@ ch, about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred tex@@ ts a day.
And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face.
There's this great piece in The Atlan@@ tic.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Bar@@ n@@ well.
And he gave his kids a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using not@@ es.
And he said this: "I came to realiz@@ e@@ ..."
"I came to realize that convers@@ ational compe@@ ten@@ ce might be the single most over@@ looked skill we fail to teach@@ .
Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through scre@@ ens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to h@@ one their inter@@ personal communications skills.
It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselv@@ es: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain coher@@ ent, confident convers@@ ation@@ ?"
Now, I make my living talking to people@@ : Nobel Prize win@@ ners, truck driver@@ s, billion@@ air@@ es, kindergar@@ ten teachers, heads of state, plum@@ ber@@ s.
I talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like.
I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level.
But I still have a great conversation with them.
So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics to discuss in adv@@ ance, look, no@@ d and smile to show that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard or summar@@ ize it.
So I want you to forget all of that.
It is cr@@ ap.
There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention.
Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional intervie@@ wer that I do in regular life.
So, I'm going to teach you how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you learn how to be better convers@@ ation@@ al@@ ists.
L@@ earn to have a conversation without was@@ ting your time, without getting bor@@ ed, and, please God, without off@@ ending anybody.
We've all had really great convers@@ ations.
We've had them before. We know what it's like.
The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspi@@ red, or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understo@@ od.
There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that.
So I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honest@@ ly, if you just choose one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better convers@@ ations.
Number one: Don't mul@@ tit@@ ask.
And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tab@@ let or your car keys or whatever is in your hand.
I mean, be present.
Be in that moment.
Don't think about your argument you had with your bos@@ s.
Don't think about what you're going to have for din@@ ner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it and half out of it.
Number two: Don't pon@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate.
If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pus@@ h@@ back or growth, write a blog@@ .
Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow p@@ und@@ its on my show@@ : Because they're really bor@@ ing.
If they're conserv@@ ative, they're going to hate Obama and food stam@@ ps and abor@@ tion.
If they're liber@@ al, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Ch@@ ene@@ y.
T@@ ot@@ ally predic@@ table.
And you don't want to be like that.
You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn.
The fam@@ ed therap@@ ist M. Scott P@@ eck said that true listening requires a setting aside of on@@ es@@ el@@ f.
And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opin@@ ion.
He said that sensing this accept@@ ance, and more and more likely to open up the inner rec@@ esses of his or her mind to the listen@@ er.
Again, assume that you have something to learn.
Bill N@@ ye@@ : "@@ Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don@@ '@@ t."
I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something.
Number thre@@ e: Use open-@@ ended questions.
In this case, take a cu@@ e from journal@@ ists.
Star@@ t your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.
If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out.
If I ask you, "W@@ ere you terri@@ fi@@ ed@@ ?"
You're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is "@@ terri@@ fi@@ ed@@ ," and the answer is "Yes, I was@@ " or "No, I was@@ n@@ '@@ t."
"W@@ ere you angr@@ y?" "Yes, I was very angr@@ y."
Let them describe it. They're the ones that know.
Try asking them things like, "What was that like@@ ?"
"How did that feel@@ ?"
Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get a much more interesting response.
Number four@@ : Go with the flow@@ .
That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind.
We've heard interviews often in which a gu@@ est is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of no@@ where, or it's already been answer@@ ed.
That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that.
And we do the exact same thing.
We're sitting there having a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time that we met Hu@@ gh Jack@@ man in a coffee sho@@ p.
And we stop listening.
Stor@@ ies and ideas are going to come to you.
You need to let them come and let them go.
Number fi@@ ve: If you don't know, say that you don't know.
Now, people on the radio, especially on N@@ P@@ R, are much more aware that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure.
Do that. Er@@ r on the side of cau@@ tion.
Talk should not be cheap.
Number six@@ : Don't equ@@ ate your experience with the@@ ir@@ s.
If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family mem@@ ber.
If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job.
It's not the same. It is never the same.
All experiences are individual.
And, more importantly, it is not about you.
You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffer@@ ed.
Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his I@@ Q was, and he said, "I have no idea. People who br@@ a@@ g about their I@@ Q@@ s are los@@ er@@ s."
Con@@ vers@@ ations are not a promo@@ tional opportunity.
Number seven@@ : Try not to repeat yourself.
It's con@@ descend@@ ing, and it's really bor@@ ing, and we tend to do it a lot.
Especi@@ ally in work conversations or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep re@@ phras@@ ing it over and over.
Don't do that.
Number eigh@@ t: Sta@@ y out of the we@@ eds.
Frank@@ ly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dat@@ es, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind.
They don't care. What they care about is you.
They care about what you're like, what you have in common.
So forget the deta@@ ils. Le@@ ave them out.
Number n@@ ine@@ : This is not the last one, but it is the most important one.
L@@ ist@@ en.
I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop@@ .
Budd@@ ha said, and I'm par@@ aph@@ ras@@ ing, "If your mouth is open, you're not lear@@ n@@ ing."
And Cal@@ vin Co@@ ol@@ idge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job@@ ."
Why do we not listen to each other@@ ?
Number one, we'd rather talk.
When I'm talking, I'm in control.
I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in.
I'm the center of attention.
I can bol@@ ster my own identity.
But there's another reason@@ : We get distrac@@ ted.
The average person talks at about 2@@ 25 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute.
So our minds are filling in those other 2@@ 75 words.
And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation.
You're just two people sh@@ ou@@ ting out barely related sentences in the same place.
You have to listen to one another.
Stephen Co@@ vey said it very beauti@@ fully.
He said, "@@ Most of us don't listen with the int@@ ent to understand.

TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How much do you know about intellectual dis@@ abil@@ iti@@ es? Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s cham@@ pi@@ on and amb@@ ass@@ ador Matthew Willi@@ ams is proof that athle@@ tic competition and the camar@@ ader@@ ie it fos@@ ters can transform lives, both on and off the field. Toge@@ ther with his fellow ath@@ let@@ es, he invi@@ tes you to join him at the next meet - and challenges you to walk away with your heart un@@ changed.
Matthew William@@ s: Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s let me be myself - a cham@@ p@@ ion.
Hell@@ o.
My name is Matthew William@@ s, and I am a cham@@ p@@ ion.
I have won med@@ als in three different sports and national games in Canada, compe@@ ted at the international level in basketball and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train five days a week for basketball and speed sk@@ ating, work with top quality co@@ aches and mental performance consul@@ tant@@ s to be at my best in my sport@@ .
By the way, all that is through Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s.
Does that change the way you think of me and my accomplish@@ ment@@ s?
The world does not see all people like me as champion@@ s.
Not long ago, people like me were sh@@ un@@ ned and hidden away.
There has been lots of change since Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s began in 1968, but in too many cases, people with intellectual dis@@ abilities are invisible to the wider population.
People use the r@@ -@@ word in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter.
That's the word "@@ retar@@ d" or "@@ retar@@ ded@@ " used in a der@@ og@@ atory man@@ ner.
They're not thinking about how much it hur@@ ts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case.
I am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual dis@@ abil@@ ities, or, too often, how they don't see them at all.
Did you know the World G@@ ames happened this year@@ ?
I was one of over 6,@@ 500 athletes with intellectual dis@@ abilities from 16@@ 5 countries who compe@@ ted in L@@ A.
There was over 6@@ 2,000 spec@@ t@@ ators watching opening ceremon@@ ies, and there was live cover@@ age on T@@ S@@ N and ES@@ P@@ N.
Did you even know that happened?
What do you think of when you see someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to look at us as equal@@ s.
Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s trans@@ forms the self-@@ identity of athletes with intellectual dis@@ abilities and the percep@@ tions of everyone watch@@ ing.
For those of you who aren't familiar, Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s is for athletes with intellectual dis@@ abilities.
Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s is separate from the Par@@ al@@ ym@@ pic@@ s and Olympic@@ s.
We offer high-@@ quality, year round sports programs for people with intellectual dis@@ abilities that changes lives and percep@@ tions.
This movement has changed my life and those of so many others.
And it has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual dis@@ abilities.
I was born with epilep@@ sy and an intellectual dis@@ ability.
Gro@@ wing up, I played h@@ oc@@ key until I was 12 years old.
The older I got, the more I felt it was harder to keep up with everyone else, and I was angry and frustr@@ ated.
For a while, I did not play any sport@@ s, didn't have many friends and felt left out and s@@ ad.
There was a time when people with intellectual dis@@ abilities were hidden away from society.
No one thought they could participate in sport@@ s, let alone be a valu@@ ed member of society.
In the 196@@ 0s, Dr. Frank Hay@@ den, a scientist at the University of Toron@@ to, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fit@@ ness levels of children with intellectual dis@@ abilities.
Using rigor@@ ous scientific research, Dr. Hay@@ den and other researchers that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fit@@ ness levels to suffer@@ .
Lots of people doub@@ ted that people with intellectual dis@@ abilities could benefit from fit@@ ness programs and sports competition opportunities.
But pione@@ ers like Dr. Hay@@ den and E@@ un@@ ice Kennedy Sh@@ river, the founder of Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s, persever@@ ed, and Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s athletes have proved them right four and a half million times over.
Before I joined Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s, I was nervous because I was young, sh@@ y, not confident and didn't have many friends.
When I got there, though, everyone was very encour@@ aging, suppor@@ tive, and let me be myself without being judg@@ ed.
Now, I am a basketball player and speed sk@@ ater who has compe@@ ted at prov@@ inci@@ al, national games, and this year made it all the way to the World Sum@@ mer G@@ ames in L@@ A, where I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team to compete at World Gam@@ es.
I am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe, and I've heard so many similar stories.
Being Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s athletes rest@@ ores our pride and dign@@ ity.
Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s also addr@@ esses critical health needs.
Stu@@ dies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual dis@@ abilities die 13 years younger than men wi@@ thou@@ t, and women with intellectual dis@@ abilities die 20 years younger than women wi@@ thou@@ t.
Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport@@ .
Also, our co@@ aches teach us about nutrition and health.
Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or access@@ ing health care.
At the 20@@ 15 World Sum@@ mer Gam@@ es, my Te@@ am Canada team@@ mates and I played the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team went to the World G@@ ames Heal@@ thy Ath@@ le@@ te scre@@ en@@ ing, where seven of 10 members were given hearing a@@ ids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time.
The change in them was amazing.
They were more excited, happy and confid@@ ent, because their co@@ ach could voc@@ ally communicate with them.
And they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basket@@ ball, the sounds of the whist@@ le and the che@@ ering f@@ ans in the stands - sounds that we take for gran@@ ted.
Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s is transforming more than just the athle@@ te in their sport@@ .
Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s is transforming their lives off the field.
This year, research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the US don't know a single person with an intellectual dis@@ ability, and the 44 percent of Americans who don't have personal contact with intellectual dis@@ abilities are significantly less accepting and positive.
Then there's the r@@ -@@ word, prov@@ ing that people with intellectual dis@@ abilities are still invisible to far too many people.
People use it as a cas@@ ual term or an insul@@ t.
It was t@@ wee@@ ted more than nine million times last year, and it is deeply hur@@ tful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet.
People don't think it's insul@@ ting, but it is.
As my fellow athle@@ te and global mess@@ eng@@ er John Franklin Steph@@ ens wrote in an open letter to a political pun@@ di@@ t who used the r@@ -@@ word as an insul@@ t, "Come join us someday at Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s.
See if you walk away with your heart un@@ chang@@ ed."
This year, at the 20@@ 15 World Sum@@ mer Gam@@ es, people lined up for hours to get into the final night of power@@ lif@@ ting competition.
So it was standing room only when my team@@ mate Jack@@ ie B@@ arret@@ t, the New@@ found@@ land Mo@@ os@@ e, dead@@ lifted 6@@ 55 pounds and lifted 6@@ 11 pounds in the squ@@ at - setting huge new records for Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s.
Jack@@ ie is a record hol@@ der among all power@@ lif@@ ters in New@@ found@@ land - not just Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s, all power@@ lif@@ ters.
Jack@@ ie was a huge star in L@@ A, and ES@@ P@@ N li@@ ve-@@ t@@ wee@@ ted his recor@@ d-@@ breaking lif@@ ts and were wo@@ wed by his performance.
Fifty years ago, few imagined individuals with intellectual dis@@ abilities could do anything like that.
This year, 60,000 spec@@ t@@ ators filled the famous L@@ A Mem@@ orial Col@@ ise@@ um to watch the opening ceremon@@ ies of World G@@ ames and che@@ er athletes from 16@@ 5 countries around the world.
F@@ ar from being hidden away, we were che@@ ered and celebr@@ ated.
Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves.
Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s teaches the world that people with intellectual dis@@ abilities deserve respect and inclus@@ ion.
Now, I have dreams and achiev@@ ements in my sport@@ , great co@@ ach@@ es, respect and dign@@ ity, better health, and I am pursuing a career as a personal train@@ er.
I am no longer hid@@ den, bul@@ lied and I am here doing a TED Tal@@ k.
The world is a different place because of Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s, but there is still farther to go.
So the next time you see someone with an intellectual dis@@ ability, I hope you will see their ability.
The next time someone uses the r@@ -@@ word near you, I hope you will tell them how much it hur@@ ts.
I hope you will think about getting involved with Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s.
I would like to leave you with one final thought.
Nelson Mandela said, "S@@ port@@ s has the power to change the world."
Spe@@ cial Olympic@@ s is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to be confid@@ ent, meet friends, not be jud@@ ged and get to feel like and be champion@@ s.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: When Ebola broke out in March 2014, Par@@ d@@ is Sab@@ et@@ i and her team got to work sequencing the vir@@ us@@ 's genome, learning how it mu@@ tated and spre@@ ad. Sab@@ et@@ i immediately released her research online, so virus track@@ ers and scientists from around the world could join in the urgent figh@@ t. In this talk, she shows how open cooperation was key to hal@@ ting the virus ... and to attac@@ king the next one to come along. "We had to work open@@ ly, we had to share and we had to work together@@ ," Sab@@ et@@ i say@@ s. "@@ Let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wr@@ ought by one virus, but illumin@@ ated by billions of hearts and minds working in un@@ ity."
Par@@ d@@ is Sab@@ eti@@ : How we'll fight the next deadly virus.
You may never have heard of K@@ ene@@ ma, Sierra Le@@ one or A@@ rua, Nigeria.
But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.
In hospitals there, there's a community of nur@@ ses, physicians and scientists that have been quiet@@ ly batt@@ ling one of the dead@@ li@@ est threats to humanity for year@@ s: L@@ ass@@ a virus.
L@@ ass@@ a virus is a lot like E@@ bola.
It can cause a severe fe@@ ver and can often be fat@@ al.
But these individuals, they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities, and by doing so, protect us all.
But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them on one of my first vis@@ its out there many years ago was that they start each morning - these challeng@@ ing, extraordinary days on the front lines - by sing@@ ing.
They gather together, and they show their jo@@ y.
They show their spir@@ it.
And over the years, from year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me, I get to gather with them and I sing and we write and we love it, because it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together@@ ; we're bon@@ ded through a shared humanity.
And that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important, even essenti@@ al, as things begin to change.
And that changed a great deal in March of 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declar@@ ed in Gu@@ ine@@ a.
This is the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Le@@ one and Liber@@ ia.
And it was frighten@@ ing, frighten@@ ing for us all.
We had actually suspec@@ ted for some time that L@@ ass@@ a and Ebola were more widespread than thought, and we thought it could one day come to K@@ ene@@ ma.
And so members of my team immediately went out and joined Dr. Hum@@ ar@@ r Khan and his team there, and we set up diagnos@@ tics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Le@@ one.
We'd already set up this kind of capacity for L@@ ass@@ a virus, we knew how to do it, the team is out@@ stand@@ ing.
We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for E@@ bola.
And unfortunately, that day cam@@ e.
On May 2@@ 3, 2014, a woman checked into the matern@@ ity ward at the hospital, and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confir@@ med case of Ebola in Sierra Le@@ one.
This was an excep@@ tional work that was done.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact trac@@ ing to follow what was going on.
It coul@@ d@@ 've stopped something.
But by the time that day came, the outbreak had already been breeding for months.
With hundreds of cases, it had already eclip@@ sed all previous out@@ break@@ s.
And it came into Sierra Le@@ one not as that singular case, but as a tid@@ al wav@@ e.
We had to work with the international community, with the Min@@ istry of Heal@@ th, with K@@ ene@@ ma, to begin to deal with the cases, as the next week brought 3@@ 1, then 9@@ 2, then 14@@ 7 cases - all coming to K@@ ene@@ ma, one of the only places in Sierra Le@@ one that could deal with this.
And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could, trying to help the individuals, trying to get attention, but we also did one other simple thing.
From that speci@@ men that we take from a patient's blood to detect E@@ bola, we can dis@@ card it, obvi@@ ously.
The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and de@@ activate it, so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean, and that's what we did.
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.
And we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day, and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
This is the blue@@ print - the genome of a virus is the blue@@ print.
We all have one.
It says everything that makes up us, and it tells us so much information.
The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful.
We could actually take these 99 different vir@@ uses, look at them and compare them, and we could see, actually, compared to three genomes that had been previously published from Gu@@ ine@@ a, we could show that the outbreak emerged in Gu@@ ine@@ a months before, once into the human population, and from there had been transmit@@ ting from human to human.
Now, that's incredibly important when you're trying to figure out how to interven@@ e, but the important thing is contact trac@@ ing.
We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans, it was mut@@ ating.
And each of those mutations are so important, because the diagnos@@ tics, the vaccin@@ es, the therap@@ ies that we're using, are all based on that genome sequ@@ ence, fundamentally - that's what drives it.
And so global health experts would need to respon@@ d, would have to develop@@ , to re@@ calibr@@ ate everything that they were doing.
But the way that science works, the position I was in at that point is, I had the data, and I could have worked in a sil@@ o for many, many months, analyzed the data carefully, slowly, submit@@ ted the paper for public@@ ation, gone through a few back@@ -and-@@ for@@ th@@ s, and then finally when the paper came out, might release that data.
That's the way the status quo works.
Well, that was not going to work at this point, right?
We had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help, lots of help.
So the first thing we did is, as soon as the sequ@@ ences came off the machines, we published it to the web.
We just released it to the whole world and said, "H@@ el@@ p us."
And help cam@@ e.
Before we knew it, we were being contacted from people all over, surprised to see the data out there and releas@@ ed.
Some of the greatest viral track@@ ers in the world were suddenly part of our community.
We were working together in this virtual way, shar@@ ing, regular call@@ s, communic@@ ations, trying to follow the virus minute by minute, to see ways that we could stop it.
And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that.
Every@@ body, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally, was reaching out to learn, to participa@@ te, to eng@@ age.
Everybody wants to play a part.
The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing, and the Internet connects us all.
And could you imagine that instead of being frighten@@ ed of each other, that we all just said, "Let's do this.
Let's work together, and let's make this happen@@ ."
But the problem is that the data that all of us are using, Goog@@ ling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do.
And so many opportunities get missed when that happens.
So in the early part of the epidemic from K@@ ene@@ ma, we'd had 10@@ 6 clinical records from patients, and we once again made that publicly available to the world.
And in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 10@@ 6 recor@@ ds, we could train computers to predict the pro@@ g@@ nos@@ is for Ebola patients to near 100 percent accur@@ acy.
And we made an app that could release that, to make that available to health@@ -@@ care workers in the field.
But 10@@ 6 is just not enough to make it powerful, to valid@@ ate it.
So we were waiting for more data to release that.
And the data has still not come.
We are still wait@@ ing, twe@@ aking away, in sil@@ os rather than working together.
And this just - we can't accept that.
Right? You@@ , all of you, cannot accept that.
It's our lives on the line.
And in fact, actually, many lives were los@@ t, many health@@ -@@ care workers, including beloved colleagues of mine, five colleagu@@ es: M@@ bal@@ u F@@ on@@ ni@@ e, Alex Mo@@ ig@@ bo@@ i, Dr. Hum@@ ar@@ r Kh@@ an, Alice Ko@@ vo@@ ma and Moham@@ ed Ful@@ la@@ h.
These are just five of many health@@ -@@ care workers at Ken@@ ema and beyond that died while the world waited and while we all worked, quiet@@ ly and separ@@ ately.
See, E@@ bola, like all threats to humanity, it's fuel@@ ed by mis@@ trust and distrac@@ tion and divis@@ ion.
When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves, the virus thri@@ ves.
But unlike all threats to humanity, Ebola is one where we're actually all the same.
We're all in this fight together.
Ebola on one person's door@@ step could soon be on our@@ s.
And so in this place with the same vulner@@ abil@@ ities, the same streng@@ th@@ s, the same fear@@ s, the same hop@@ es, I hope that we work together with jo@@ y.
A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Le@@ one, and she discovered that the word "K@@ ene@@ ma@@ ," the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Le@@ one, is named after the Men@@ de word for "@@ clear like a river, trans@@ lu@@ cent and open to the public gaz@@ e."
That was really profound for us, because without knowing it, we'd always felt that in order to honor the individuals in Ken@@ ema where we worked, we had to work open@@ ly, we had to share and we had to work together.
And we have to do that.
We all have to demand that of ourselves and others - to be open to each other when an outbreak happens, to fight in this fight together.
Because this is not the first outbreak of E@@ bola, it will not be the last, and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait, like L@@ ass@@ a virus and others.
And the next time this happens, it could happen in a city of milli@@ ons, it could start there.
It could be something that's transmitted through the air.
It could even be dissemin@@ ated inten@@ tion@@ ally.
And I know that that is frighten@@ ing, I understand that, but I know also, and this experience shows us, that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing, to win this and have the upper hand over vir@@ uses.
But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with jo@@ y.
So for Dr. Khan and for all of those who sacrific@@ ed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always, let us be in this fight with them al@@ ways.
And let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wr@@ ought by one virus, but illumin@@ ated by billions of hearts and minds working in un@@ ity.
Thank you.
