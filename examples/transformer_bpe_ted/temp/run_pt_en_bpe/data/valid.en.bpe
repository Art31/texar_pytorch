TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: At TED@@ 2009, Al Gore presents up@@ dated slides from around the globe to make the case that worrying climate trends are even worse than scientists predic@@ ted, and to make clear his st@@ ance on "@@ clean co@@ al."
Al Gor@@ e: What comes after An In@@ convenient Tru@@ th?
Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states, has sh@@ run@@ k by 40 percent.
But this underst@@ ates the serious@@ ness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thick@@ ness of the ice.
The arc@@ tic ice cap is, in a sense, the beating heart of the global climate system.
It exp@@ ands in winter and contrac@@ ts in summer.
The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast-@@ forward of what's happened over the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is marked in red.
As you see, it exp@@ ands to the dark blue - that's the annual ice in winter@@ , and it contrac@@ ts in summer.
The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older, you can see is almost like blood, sp@@ illing out of the body here.
In 25 years it's gone from this, to this.
This is a problem because the warming he@@ ats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Oce@@ an, where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which, when it th@@ aw@@ s, is turned into methane by microb@@ es.
Com@@ par@@ ed to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, that amount could double if we cross this tip@@ ping point.
Al@@ ready in some sh@@ allow la@@ kes in Alask@@ a, methane is actively bub@@ bling up out of the water.
Professor K@@ ate@@ y Walter from the University of Alask@@ a went out with another team to another sh@@ allow lake last winter@@ .
Video: Who@@ a! Al Gor@@ e: She's okay. The question is whether we will be.
And one reason is, this enormous heat sink he@@ ats up Green@@ land from the nor@@ th.
This is an annual melting river.
But the volumes are much larger than ever.
This is the K@@ ang@@ er@@ lus@@ su@@ a@@ q River in sou@@ thwest Green@@ land.
If you want to know how sea level ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea.
These flows are increasing very rapid@@ ly.
At the other end of the planet, Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet.
Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance.
And west Antarctica cro@@ pped up on top some under-@@ sea is@@ lands, is particularly rapid in its mel@@ ting.
That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Green@@ land.
In the Himalay@@ as, the third largest mass of ice: at the top you see new la@@ kes, which a few years ago were glaci@@ ers.
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow@@ .
In the An@@ des, this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city.
The flows have increas@@ ed.
But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water.
In California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snow@@ pac@@ k.
This is hitting the reser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s.
And the predic@@ tions, as you've read, are serious.
This dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fir@@ es.
And the disas@@ ters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate.
Four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 7@@ 5.
This is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern.
If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing.
In the last five years we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours - 25 million tons every day to the oceans.
Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific@@ , from the Americ@@ as, extend@@ ing w@@ est@@ ward, and on either side of the Indian sub@@ contin@@ ent, where there is a radical deple@@ tion of oxygen in the oceans.
The biggest single cause of global warming, along with deforest@@ ation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels.
O@@ il is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem.
The United States is one of the two largest emit@@ ters, along with China.
And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants.
But we're beginning to see a sea change.
Here are the ones that have been cancel@@ led in the last few years with some green alternatives propos@@ ed.
Ho@@ we@@ ver there is a political battle in our country.
And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calend@@ ar year promoting clean coal, which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on.
That image reminded me of something.
Around Christ@@ mas, in my home in Tennes@@ see, a billion gallons of coal s@@ lu@@ d@@ ge was sp@@ il@@ led.
You probably saw it on the news.
This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America.
This happened around Christ@@ mas.
One of the coal industr@@ y's ads around Christmas was this one.
Video: ♪@@ ♫ F@@ ros@@ ty the coal man is a jol@@ ly, happy soul.
He's abundant here in America, and he helps our economy grow.
F@@ ros@@ ty the coal man is getting clean@@ er every@@ day.
He's affordable and ador@@ able, and workers keep their pa@@ y.
Al Gor@@ e: This is the source of much of the coal in West Virgin@@ ia.
The largest mountain@@ top min@@ er is the head of M@@ asse@@ y Co@@ al.
Video: Don B@@ lan@@ k@@ en@@ ship@@ : Let me be clear about it. Al G@@ ore, Nancy P@@ el@@ os@@ i, Harry Re@@ id, they don't know what they're talking about.
Al Gor@@ e: So the Al@@ li@@ ance for Climate Pro@@ tec@@ tion has launched two campa@@ ign@@ s.
This is one of them, part of one of them.
Video: Ac@@ tor@@ : At CO@@ AL@@ erg@@ y we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business.
That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about coal.
The fact is, coal isn't dir@@ ty.
We think it's clean - smells good, too.
So don't worry about climate change.
Le@@ ave that up to us.
Video: Ac@@ tor@@ : C@@ lean coal - you've heard a lot about it.
So let's take a tour of this state@@ -of-the-@@ art clean coal facil@@ ity.
Amaz@@ ing@@ ! The machinery is kind of lou@@ d.
But that's the sound of clean coal technology.
And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming, the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything.
Take a good long loo@@ k: this is today's clean coal technology.
Al Gor@@ e: Finally, the positive alternative mes@@ hes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge.
Video: Narrator: America is in crisis - the economy, national security, the climate crisis.
The thread that links them all@@ : our addic@@ tion to carbon based fuel@@ s, like dirty coal and foreign oil.
But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this m@@ ess.
Re@@ power America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years.
A plan to put America back to work, make us more sec@@ ure, and help stop global warming.
Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems.
Re@@ power America. F@@ ind out more.
Al Gor@@ e: This is the last one.
Video: Narrator: It's about re@@ power@@ ing America.
One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet.
Man: Fu@@ ture@@ 's over here. Win@@ d, sun, a new energy gr@@ id.
Man #@@ 2: New investments to create high-@@ paying jobs.
Narrator: Re@@ power America. It's time to get real.
Al Gor@@ e: There is an old African pro@@ ver@@ b that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone.
If you want to go far, go together@@ ."
We need to go far, quickly.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In this short talk from TED U 2009, Brian Co@@ x shares what's new with the CE@@ R@@ N super@@ col@@ lid@@ er. He covers the re@@ pairs now under@@ way and what the future holds for the largest science experiment ever attemp@@ ted.
Brian Co@@ x@@ : What went wrong at the LH@@ C.
Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LH@@ C.
And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked.
So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there, the LH@@ C is the largest scientific experiment ever attemp@@ ted - 27 kilometers in circum@@ fer@@ ence.
Its job is to re@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billion@@ th of a second after the universe began@@ , up to 600 million times a second.
It's nothing if not ambi@@ ti@@ ous.
This is the machine below Gen@@ ev@@ a.
We take the pictures of those mini-@@ Big Bang@@ s inside detec@@ tors.
This is the one I work on. It's called the AT@@ L@@ A@@ S detector - 44 meters wide, 22 meters in diame@@ ter.
S@@ pec@@ tac@@ ular picture here of AT@@ L@@ A@@ S under construction so you can see the scale.
On the 10@@ th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time.
And this picture was taken by AT@@ L@@ A@@ S.
It caused immense celebr@@ ation in the control room.
It's a picture of the first be@@ am particle going all the way around the LH@@ C, col@@ lid@@ ing with a piece of the LH@@ C deliber@@ ately, and sho@@ wer@@ ing particles into the detec@@ tor.
In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10@@ th we knew the machine worked, which is a great trium@@ ph@@ .
I don't know whether this got the biggest che@@ er, or this, when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that.
It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact.
About a week later we had a problem with the machine, related actually to these bits of wire here - these gold wir@@ es.
Those wires carry 13 thousand am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power.
Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say, "No they don't. They're small wir@@ es."
They can do that because when they are very cold they are what's called super@@ conduc@@ ting wi@@ re.
So at minus 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees, col@@ der than the space between the stars, those wires can take that curr@@ ent.
In one of the join@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 magne@@ ts in LH@@ C, there was a manufacturing defec@@ t.
So the wire he@@ ated up sligh@@ tly, and its 13@@ ,000 am@@ ps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now that's more impress@@ ive when you consider those magne@@ ts weigh over 20 ton@@ s, and they moved about a foot.
So we dam@@ aged about 50 of the magne@@ ts.
We had to take them out, which we did.
We re@@ condition@@ ed them all, fixed them.
They're all on their way back underground now.
By the end of March the LH@@ C will be int@@ act again.
We will switch it on, and we expect to take data in June or Jul@@ y, and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are.
Now of course, in a way those accidents re@@ ign@@ ite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refu@@ te.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we're over@@ reach@@ ing, is the value of things like the LH@@ C.
I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y Dav@@ y, who, I suspec@@ t, when def@@ ending his prote@@ ge@@ 's us@@ eless experiments - his protege was Michael Far@@ ad@@ ay - said this, "@@ Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultima@@ te, that there are no myster@@ ies in nature, that our trium@@ ph@@ s are comple@@ te, and that there are no new worlds to con@@ quer@@ ."
Thank you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: MIT gr@@ ad student David M@@ err@@ ill demos S@@ if@@ tables - cook@@ i@@ e-@@ siz@@ ed, computer@@ ized tiles you can stack and shu@@ ff@@ le in your hands. These future@@ -@@ toys can do math, play music, and talk to their friends, too. Is this the next thing in hand@@ s-@@ on lear@@ n@@ ing?
David M@@ err@@ ill@@ : To@@ y tiles that talk to each other.
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid, playing with bloc@@ ks.
As you figured out how to reach out and gras@@ p, pick them up and move them around, you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipul@@ ating spatial relationships.
S@@ pati@@ al reason@@ ing is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, as a computer scientist inspired by this util@@ ity of our interactions with physical objects - along with my advis@@ er Pat@@ ti@@ e, and my collabor@@ ator Je@@ ev@@ an Kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i - I started to wonder - what if when we used a computer, instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital finger@@ tip moving around a flat desk@@ top, what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physic@@ ally.
Ar@@ ranging it the way we wan@@ ted?
This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer, by building S@@ if@@ tab@@ les.
In a nut@@ sh@@ ell, a S@@ if@@ table is an interactive computer the size of a cook@@ ie.
They're able to be moved around by hand, they can sense each other, they can sense their motion, and they have a screen and a wireless radi@@ o.
Most importantly, they're physic@@ al, so like the bloc@@ ks, you can move them just by reaching out and gras@@ ping.
And S@@ if@@ tables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipul@@ ating digital information.
And as these tools become more physic@@ al, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction st@@ yl@@ es.
So, I'm going to start with some simple examples.
This S@@ if@@ table is con@@ figured to show video, and if I til@@ t it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way@@ ; if I til@@ t it the other way it rol@@ ls it backwards.
And these interactive portra@@ its are aware of each other.
So if I put them next to each other, they get intereste@@ d.
If they get surr@@ oun@@ ded, they notice that too, they might get a little fl@@ us@@ ter@@ ed.
And they can also sense their motion and til@@ t.
One of the interesting implications on interac@@ tion, we started to realiz@@ e, was that we could use everyday gest@@ ures on data, like pouring a color the way we might pour a liqu@@ id.
So in this case, we've got three S@@ if@@ tables con@@ figured to be paint buck@@ ets and I can use them to pour color into that central one, where they get mix@@ ed.
If we o@@ vers@@ hoo@@ t, we can pour a little bit back.
There are also some neat possibilities for education, like language, math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly, and view the results immediately.
So here I'm - This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.
Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mas@@ h@@ -up between Scr@@ ab@@ ble and B@@ og@@ g@@ le.
Basically, in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each S@@ if@@ table, and as you try to make words it chec@@ ks against a diction@@ ary.
Then, after about 30 seconds, it res@@ hu@@ f@@ fl@@ es, and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.
Thank you.
So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab, and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.
They really loved it.
And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instruc@@ tions.
All you have to say is, "M@@ ake word@@ s," and they know exactly what to do.
So here's another few people trying it out.
That's our youngest be@@ ta test@@ er, down there on the right.
Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the S@@ if@@ tables up.
So to him, they were just bloc@@ ks.
Now, this is an interactive cartoon applic@@ ation.
And we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners.
And this is Fel@@ ix, actually.
And he can bring new characters into the scen@@ e, just by lif@@ ting the S@@ if@@ tables off the table that have that character shown on them.
Here, he's bringing the sun out.
Video: The sun is ris@@ ing.
David M@@ err@@ ill@@ : Now he's brought a trac@@ tor into the scen@@ e.
Video: The orange trac@@ tor.
Good job@@ ! Yeah@@ !
D@@ M: So by shaking the S@@ if@@ tables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact - Video: Wo@@ of@@ !
D@@ M: invent@@ ing his own narr@@ ative.
Video: Hel@@ lo@@ !
D@@ M: It's an open-@@ ended story, and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds.
Video: F@@ ly away, cat@@ .
D@@ M: So, the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently, in which S@@ if@@ tables act as sounds like lead@@ , bas@@ s and dr@@ um@@ s.
Each of these has four different vari@@ ations, you get to choose which one you want to use.
And you can injec@@ t these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.
And you injec@@ t it by just bum@@ ping up the sound S@@ if@@ table against a sequence S@@ if@@ table.
There are effects that you can control live, like rever@@ b and fil@@ ter.
You attach it to a particular sound and then til@@ t to adjust it.
And then, overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequ@@ ence.
So let's have a look.
Video: D@@ M: We'll start by putting a lead into two sequence S@@ if@@ tab@@ les, arr@@ ange them into a seri@@ es, extend it, add a little more lead@@ .
Now I put a bas@@ s line in.
Video: D@@ M: Now I'll put some per@@ cus@@ sion in.
Video: D@@ M: And now I'll attach the filter to the dr@@ um@@ s, so I can control the effect live.
Video: D@@ M: I can speed up the whole sequence by til@@ ting the tempo one way or the other.
Video: D@@ M: And now I'll attach the filter to the bas@@ s for some more expression.
Video: D@@ M: I can re@@ arr@@ ange the sequence while it play@@ s.
So I don't have to plan it out in adv@@ ance, but I can improvis@@ e, making it longer or shorter as I go.
And now, finally, I can f@@ ade the whole sequence out using the volume S@@ if@@ table, til@@ ted to the left.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my passion is for making new human-@@ computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.
And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space, and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laborator@@ y.
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cus@@ p of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms.
Thank you very much.
I look forward to talking with all of you.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Elizabeth Gil@@ bert mus@@ es on the impossible things we expect from artists and geni@@ uses - and shares the radical idea that, instead of the rare person "@@ be@@ ing" a geni@@ us, all of us "@@ hav@@ e" a geni@@ us. It's a funny, personal and surprisingly moving talk.
Elizabeth Gil@@ ber@@ t: Your el@@ us@@ ive creative geni@@ us.
I am a writ@@ er.
W@@ r@@ iting books is my profess@@ ion but it's more than that, of course.
It is also my great lifel@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation.
And I don't expect that that's ever going to change.
But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career, which has caused me to have to re@@ calibr@@ ate my whole relationship with this work.
And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book, this me@@ mo@@ ir called "E@@ at, Pra@@ y, Lo@@ ve" which, decid@@ edly unlike any of my previous books, went out in the world for some reason, and became this big, mega-@@ sens@@ ation, international best@@ sell@@ er thing.
The result of which is that everywhere I go now, people treat me like I'm do@@ ome@@ d.
Ser@@ i@@ ously - do@@ ome@@ d, do@@ o@@ med@@ !
Like, they come up to me now, all worri@@ ed, and they say, "@@ Ar@@ en't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that?
Ar@@ en't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all, ever again@@ ?"
So that's re@@ assur@@ ing, you know.
But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I was a teenag@@ er, when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer, I was met with this same sort of fe@@ ar-@@ based reac@@ tion.
And people would say, "@@ Ar@@ en't you afraid you're never going to have any success@@ ?
Ar@@ en't you afraid the humili@@ ation of rejec@@ tion will kill you?
Ar@@ en't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and no@@ thing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scr@@ ap he@@ ap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bit@@ ter ash of fail@@ ure@@ ?"
Like that, you know.
The answer - the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes."
Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.
And I always have been.
And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides that people can't even guess at, like sea@@ we@@ ed and other things that are scar@@ y.
But, when it comes to writing, the thing that I've been sort of thinking about l@@ ately, and wondering about l@@ ately, is why?
You know, is it ration@@ al?
Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.
And what is it specifically about creative vent@@ ures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don't do, you know?
Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?
"That chemic@@ al-@@ engineering bloc@@ k, John, how@@ 's it go@@ ing?"
It just didn't come up like that, you know?
But to be fa@@ ir, chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcohol@@ ic man@@ ic@@ -@@ depress@@ iv@@ es.
We writ@@ ers, we kind of do have that reput@@ ation, and not just writ@@ ers, but creative people across all gen@@ r@@ es, it seem@@ s, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unst@@ able.
And all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death count in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands, you know?
And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really und@@ one by their gif@@ ts, you know.
Norman M@@ ail@@ er, just before he died, last intervie@@ w, he said, "@@ Every one of my books has killed me a little mor@@ e."
An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work.
But we don't even bl@@ ink when we hear somebody say this, because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely intern@@ alized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that arti@@ str@@ y, in the end, will always ultimately lead to angu@@ ish.
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that ide@@ a?
Are you comfortable with that?
Because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know - I'm not at all comfortable with that assump@@ tion.
I think it's odi@@ ous.
And I also think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see it perpetu@@ ated into the next century.
I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live.
And I definitely know that, in my case - in my situation - it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of le@@ aking down that dark path of assump@@ tion, particularly given the circumst@@ ance that I'm in right now in my career.
Which is - you know, like check it out, I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old.
I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me.
And it's exce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish success of my last book, right?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly, because we're all sort of friends here now - it's exce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.
So Jes@@ us, what a though@@ t@@ !
That's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning, and I don't want to go there.
I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love.
And so, the question be@@ comes, how@@ ?
And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflec@@ tion, that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing, is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construc@@ t, right?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.
And, as I've been looking, over the last year, for models for how to do that, I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity.
And that search has led me to ancient Gre@@ ece and ancient Ro@@ me.
So stay with me, because it does circle around and back.
But, ancient Gre@@ ece and ancient Rome - people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then, OK?
People believed that creativity was this div@@ ine attend@@ ant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and un@@ know@@ able source, for distant and un@@ know@@ able reasons.
The Gree@@ ks famously called these div@@ ine attend@@ ant spir@@ its of creativity "@@ da@@ em@@ on@@ s."
S@@ ocr@@ ates, fam@@ ously, believed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spoke wisdom to him from af@@ ar.
The Roman@@ s had the same idea, but they called that sort of dis@@ embodied creative spirit a geni@@ us.
Which is great, because the Roman@@ s did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual.
They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical div@@ ine enti@@ ty, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist@@ 's studi@@ o, kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the house el@@ f, and who would come out and sort of invis@@ ib@@ ly ass@@ ist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work.
So brilliant - there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about - that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.
And everyone knew that this is how it function@@ ed, right?
So the ancient artist was protected from certain things, like, for example, too much narcis@@ sis@@ m, right?
If your work was brilli@@ ant, you couldn't take all the credit for it, everybody knew that you had this dis@@ embodied genius who had helped you.
If your work bombe@@ d, not entirely your faul@@ t, you know?
Everyone knew your genius was kind of lam@@ e.
And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time.
And then the Ren@@ aiss@@ ance came and everything changed, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was, let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and myster@@ ies, and there's no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures who take dict@@ ation from the div@@ ine.
And it's the beginning of rational human@@ ism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual.
And for the first time in history, you start to hear people re@@ ferring to this or that artist as being a geni@@ us, rather than having a geni@@ us.
And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge err@@ or.
You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vess@@ el, you know, like the fon@@ t and the essence and the source of all div@@ ine, creative, un@@ know@@ able, etern@@ al mystery is just a sm@@ idge too much responsibility to put on one frag@@ i@@ le, human psych@@ e.
It's like asking somebody to swal@@ low the sun.
It just completely war@@ ps and distor@@ ts eg@@ os, and it creates all these un@@ manag@@ e@@ able expectations about performance.
And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years.
And, if this is true, and I think it is true, the question be@@ comes, what now?
Can we do this different@@ ly?
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative myster@@ y.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just er@@ ase 500 years of rational human@@ istic thought in one 18 minute speech.
And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspic@@ ions about the notion of, basically, fa@@ iri@@ es who follow people around rub@@ bing fair@@ y ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff.
I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this.
But the question that I kind of want to pose is - you know, why not?
Why not think about it this way?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter mad@@ den@@ ing ca@@ pr@@ ici@@ ous@@ ness of the creative process.
A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something - which is to say basically everyone here -- knows does not always behave ration@@ ally.
And, in fact, can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ anor@@ mal.
Where I met the extraordinary American poet R@@ uth St@@ one, who's now in her 90@@ s, but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virgin@@ ia, she would be out working in the fiel@@ ds, and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape.
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air.
And it would come barrel@@ ing down at her over the landscape.
And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet.
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point, and that was to, in her words, "@@ run like hell@@ ."
And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chas@@ ed by this po@@ em, and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her, she could collect it and grab it on the page.
And other times she wouldn't be fast enough, so she'd be running and run@@ ning, and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barre@@ l through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape, looking, as she put it "@@ for another po@@ et@@ ."
And then there were these times - this is the piece I never forgot - she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?
So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her, and she grab@@ s a pencil just as it's going through her, and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it.
She would catch the poem by its tail, and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was trans@@ cri@@ bing on the page.
And in these inst@@ ances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and int@@ act but back@@ wards, from the last word to the first.
So when I heard that I was like - that's un@@ can@@ n@@ y, that's exactly what my creative process is like.
That's not at all what my creative process is - I'm not the pipel@@ ine@@ !
I'm a mu@@ le, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day, and swe@@ at and labor and barre@@ l through it really awk@@ ward@@ ly.
But even I, in my mul@@ ish@@ ness, even I have brus@@ hed up against that thing, at times.
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too.
You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honest@@ ly cannot identi@@ f@@ y.
And what is that thing?
And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds, but, in fact, might actually keep us san@@ e?
And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Wa@@ its, who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assign@@ ment.
And we were talking about this, and you know, T@@ om, for most of his life, he was pretty much the embodi@@ ment of the tor@@ mented contemporary modern artist, trying to control and manage and domin@@ ate these sort of un@@ control@@ l@@ able creative impul@@ ses that were totally intern@@ aliz@@ ed.
But then he got older, he got cal@@ mer, and one day he was driving down the free@@ way in Los Angeles, and this is when it all changed for him.
And he's spe@@ eding along, and all of a sudden he hear@@ s this little frag@@ ment of mel@@ ody, that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, el@@ us@@ ive and tant@@ aliz@@ ing, and he wants it, it's gorge@@ ous, and he long@@ s for it, but he has no way to get it.
He doesn't have a piece of paper, or a pen@@ cil, or a tape recor@@ der.
So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like, "I'm going to lose this thing, and I'll be be haun@@ ted by this song forever.
I'm not good enough, and I can't do it."
And instead of pan@@ ick@@ ing, he just stop@@ ped.
He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely no@@ vel.
He just looked up at the sky, and he said, "@@ Excuse me, can you not see that I'm dri@@ v@@ ing?"
"Do I look like I can write down a song right now?
If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportun@@ e moment when I can take care of you.
Other@@ wise, go bother somebody else today.
Go bother Leon@@ ard Coh@@ en@@ ."
And his whole work process changed after that.
Not the work, the work was still of@@ t@@ enti@@ mes as dark as ever.
But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the geni@@ e, the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from, and realized that this didn't have to be this intern@@ aliz@@ ed, tor@@ mented thing.
It could be this peculi@@ ar, won@@ dr@@ ous, bizarre collabor@@ ation, kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing that was not quite T@@ om.
When I heard that story, it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too, and this idea already saved me once.
It saved me when I was in the middle of writing "E@@ at, Pra@@ y, Lo@@ ve@@ ," and I fell into one of those sort of p@@ its of des@@ pair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disas@@ ter, the worst book ever writ@@ ten.
Not just bad, but the worst book ever writ@@ ten.
And I started to think I should just dum@@ p this project.
But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it.
So I just lifted my face up from the manuscrip@@ t and I direc@@ ted my comments to an empty corner of the room.
And I said al@@ ou@@ d, "L@@ is@@ ten you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my faul@@ t, right?
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this.
If you want it to be better, you've got to show up and do your part of the deal.
But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it.
I'm going to keep writing any@@ way because that's my job.
And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job@@ ."
Because - Because in the end it's like this, OK - centuries ago in the deser@@ ts of North Africa, people used to gather for these mo@@ on@@ light d@@ ances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours, until da@@ wn.
They were always magnific@@ ent, because the dan@@ cers were professionals and they were terri@@ fic@@ , right?
But every once in a while, very rar@@ ely, something would happen, and one of these perfor@@ mers would actually become transcend@@ ent.
And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this.
It was like time would stop, and the danc@@ er would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before, but everything would al@@ ig@@ n.
And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human.
He would be lit from within@@ , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divin@@ ity.
And when this happened, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.
They would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant, "Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, God, God, God@@ ."
That's God, you know.
Curi@@ ous historical foot@@ no@@ te: when the Mo@@ ors inv@@ aded southern S@@ pain, they took this cus@@ tom with them and the pronunci@@ ation changed over the centuries from "Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h, Al@@ la@@ h@@ ," to "O@@ l@@ é, ol@@ é, ol@@ é@@ ," which you still hear in bull@@ figh@@ ts and in flam@@ en@@ co danc@@ es.
In S@@ pain, when a per@@ former has done something impossible and mag@@ ic, "Al@@ la@@ h, ol@@ é, ol@@ é, Al@@ la@@ h, magnific@@ ent, br@@ avo@@ ," in@@ compreh@@ ensi@@ ble, there it is - a glimpse of God.
Which is great, because we need that.
But, the tricky bit comes the next morning, for the danc@@ er himself, when he wa@@ kes up and discover@@ s that it's Tues@@ day at 11 a.@@ m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God.
He's just an aging mortal with really bad kne@@ es, and maybe he's never going to asc@@ end to that height again.
And maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant God's name again as he spin@@ s, and what is he then to do with the rest of his life?
This is hard.
This is one of the most painful reconcili@@ ations to make in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of angu@@ ish if you never happened to believe, in the first place, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you.
But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimagin@@ able source for some ex@@ quis@@ ite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished, with somebody else.
And, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything.
This is how I've started to think, and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published, as the danger@@ ously, frighten@@ ingly over-@@ anticipa@@ ted follow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish success.
And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psy@@ ched out about that is don't be afr@@ aid.
Don't be da@@ un@@ ted. Just do your job.
Contin@@ ue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be.
If your job is to dance, do your dance.
If the div@@ ine, cock@@ eyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be glimp@@ sed, for just one moment through your effor@@ ts, then "O@@ lé@@ !"
And if not, do your dance any@@ how.
And "O@@ lé@@ !" to you, noneth@@ eless.
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it.
"O@@ lé@@ !" to you, noneth@@ eless, just for having the sheer human love and st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up.
Thank you.
Thank you.

TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: "Can we create new life out of our digital univer@@ se@@ ?" Craig V@@ enter as@@ ks. His answer is "@@ y@@ es" - and pretty soon. He walks through his latest research and promises that we'll soon be able to build and boo@@ t up a synthetic chromos@@ o@@ me.
Craig Vent@@ er: On the ver@@ ge of creating synthetic life.
You know, I've talked about some of these projects before - about the human genome and what that might mean, and discovering new sets of genes.
We're actually starting at a new poin@@ t: we've been digitiz@@ ing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthes@@ izing life.
So, we've always been trying to ask big questions.
"What is life@@ ?" is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels.
We've tried various approach@@ es, par@@ ing it down to mini@@ mal compon@@ ents.
We've been digitiz@@ ing it now for almost 20 year@@ s; when we sequ@@ enced the human genome, it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer.
Now we're trying to ask, "Can we re@@ generate life or can we create new life out of this digital univer@@ se@@ ?"
This is the map of a small organis@@ m, My@@ co@@ plasma gen@@ itali@@ um, that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-@@ replicate in the laborator@@ y, and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome.
We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here.
When we look at its metabolic map, it's relatively simple compared to ours - trust me, this is simple - but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time, it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell.
So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthes@@ ize this chromos@@ ome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions.
And so we started down the road of@@ : can we synthes@@ ize a chromos@@ ome@@ ?
Can chemistry perm@@ it making these really large molecules where we've never been befor@@ e?
And if we do, can we boo@@ t up a chromos@@ ome@@ ?
A chromos@@ o@@ me, by the way, is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical material.
So, our pace of digitiz@@ ing life has been increasing at an exponential pac@@ e.
Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increas@@ ing, and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.
We started this over 15 years ago.
It took several st@@ ages, in fact, starting with a bio@@ ethical review before we did the first experiments.
But it turns out synthes@@ izing DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA - 30 to 50 letters in length - and it's a de@@ generate process, so the longer you make the piece, the more errors there are.
So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the err@@ ors.
And this was our first attemp@@ t, starting with the digital information of the genome of ph@@ i X@@ 17@@ 4.
It's a small virus that kills bacteria.
We designed the pieces, went through our error correc@@ tion and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 let@@ ters.
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria, and the bacteria started to read this genetic code, made the viral particles.
The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli@@ .
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model.
They laugh@@ ed more than you guys are. And so, we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system.
But we wanted to go much lar@@ ger@@ : we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromos@@ ome - it's over 5@@ 80,000 letters of genetic code - so we thought we'd build them in cas@@ set@@ tes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cas@@ set@@ tes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are.
Design is critic@@ al, and if you're starting with digital information in the computer, that digital information has to be really accur@@ ate.
When we first sequ@@ enced this genome in 1995, the standard of accur@@ acy was one error per 10,000 base pair@@ s.
We actually found, on res@@ equ@@ encing it, 30 err@@ or@@ s; had we used that original sequ@@ ence, it never would have been able to be boo@@ ted up.
Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ lap with all the other 50-@@ letter pieces to build smaller sub@@ units we have to design so they can go together.
We design unique elements into this.
You may have read that we put water@@ marks in.
Think of this: we have a four-@@ letter genetic code - A, C, G and T.
Tri@@ ple@@ ts of those letters code for roughly 20 am@@ ino acid@@ s, such that there's a single letter design@@ ation for each of the am@@ ino acid@@ s.
So we can use the genetic code to write out words, sent@@ ences, thoughts.
I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ally, all we did was auto@@ graph it.
Some people were disap@@ pointed there was not poe@@ try.
We designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enzy@@ mes@@ ; there are enzy@@ mes that repair them and put them together.
And we started making pieces, starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 let@@ ters, put those together to make 24@@ ,000-@@ letter pieces, then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,000.
At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute.
We're trying to get to the point of automa@@ tion.
So, this looks like a basketball play@@ off.
When we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pair@@ s, they won't any longer grow read@@ ily in E. col@@ i - it exhaus@@ ts all the modern tools of molecular biology - and so we turned to other mechan@@ ism@@ s.
We knew there's a mechanism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together.
Here's an example of it: there's an organism called De@@ ino@@ coc@@ cus radi@@ od@@ ur@@ ans that can take three millions rad@@ s of radiation.
You can see in the top pan@@ el, its chromos@@ ome just gets blown apart.
Tw@@ el@@ ve to 24 hours later, it put it back together exactly as it was before.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be totally des@@ ic@@ cate@@ d; they can live in a vacu@@ um.
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space, move around, find a new aque@@ ous environment.
In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there.
Here's an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these process@@ es, actually just using ye@@ ast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in@@ ; ye@@ ast puts them together automa@@ tically.
This is not an electron micro@@ graph@@ ; this is just a regular photo@@ micro@@ graph.
It's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microsco@@ pe.
These are pictures over about a six-@@ second period.
So, this is the public@@ ation we had just a short while ago.
This is over 5@@ 80,000 letters of genetic co@@ de@@ ; it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure.
It's over 300 million molecular weight.
If we printed it out at a 10 fon@@ t with no spac@@ ing, it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code.
Well, how do we boo@@ t up a chromos@@ ome@@ ? How do we activate this?
Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple@@ ; it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.
It's also simpler when you go into eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes like ourselv@@ es: you can just pop out the nucle@@ us and pop in another one, and that's what you've all heard about with clon@@ ing.
With bacteria and Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a, the chromos@@ ome is integrated into the cell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromos@@ ome from one cell to another and activate it.
We puri@@ fied a chromos@@ ome from one microbial species - rough@@ ly, these two are as distant as human and mice - we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromos@@ o@@ me, we dig@@ ested it with enzy@@ mes to kill all the prote@@ ins, and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell - and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here.
The new chromos@@ ome went into the cell.
In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went, but we tried to design the process a little bit further.
This is a major mechanism of evolution right here.
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromos@@ ome or a third one from somewhere, adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species.
So, people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology.
There are enzy@@ mes called restric@@ tion enzy@@ mes that actually dig@@ est DNA.
The chromos@@ ome that was in the cell doesn't have on@@ e; the chromos@@ ome we put in does.
It got expressed and it recognized the other chromos@@ ome as foreign material, che@@ wed it up, and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromos@@ o@@ me.
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it.
And with a very short period of time, all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins changed, the membran@@ es chang@@ ed; when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in.
So, this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y, but we can, by moving the software of DNA around, change things quite dramatic@@ ally.
Now I've argu@@ ed, this is not gen@@ es@@ is; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution.
And I've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the Cam@@ bri@@ an explos@@ ion, where there's massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design.
Why do this?
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.
We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years.
To put it in context for my@@ self@@ : I was born in 194@@ 6.
There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 194@@ 6@@ ; within 40 years, there@@ 'll be four.
We have trouble feed@@ ing, providing fres@@ h, clean water, medic@@ ines, fuel for the six and a half billion.
It's going to be a stretch to do it for n@@ ine.
We use over five billion tons of coal, 30 billi@@ on-@@ plus barrel@@ s of oil - that's a hundred million barrel@@ s a day.
When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that, it's going to be a huge challenge.
Then of course, there's all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere.
We now, from our discovery around the world, have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think of these as the design components of the future.
The electronics industry only had a dozen or so compon@@ ents, and look at the diversity that came out of that.
We're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have techni@@ ques, because of these rapid methods of synthes@@ is, to do what we're calling combin@@ atori@@ al genom@@ ics.
We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosom@@ es a day.
When you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optim@@ ize processes to produce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produce pharmaceu@@ tic@@ als, new vaccin@@ es, we can just with a small team, do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science.
And it's just standard selec@@ tion: we can select for vi@@ ability, chemical or fuel production, vaccine production, etc.
This is a screen snap@@ shot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer.
You know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like@@ : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like.
We're focusing on now four@@ th-@@ generation fuels.
You've seen recently, corn to eth@@ anol is just a bad experiment.
We have second@@ - and thir@@ d-@@ generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar, to much hig@@ her@@ -@@ value fuels like oc@@ tan@@ e or different types of but@@ an@@ ol.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and lim@@ iting its avail@@ ability is if we start with CO2 as its feed@@ stoc@@ k, and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road.
And we think we'll have the first four@@ th-@@ generation fuels in about 18 months.
Sun@@ light and CO2 is one method ...
But in our discovery around the world, we have all kinds of other meth@@ ods.
This is an organism we described in 199@@ 6.
It lives in the deep ocean, about a mile and a half deep, almost at bo@@ il@@ ing-@@ water temperatur@@ es.
It takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source.
We're looking to see if we can take captured CO2, which can easily be pi@@ ped to sites, convert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process.
So, in a short period of time, we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of "What is life@@ ?"
We tr@@ ul@@ y, you know, have modest goals of replacing the whole petr@@ ol@@ -@@ chemical industry - Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? - become a major source of energy ...
But also, we're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccin@@ es.
You've seen this year with flu@@ ; we're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccin@@ e.
I think that can be changed by building combin@@ atori@@ al vaccines in adv@@ ance.
Here's what the future may begin to look like with changing, now, the evolutionary tree, spe@@ eding up evolution with synthetic bacteria, Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a and, eventually, eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es.
We're a ways away from improving people@@ : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Bla@@ ise A@@ gu@@ era y Ar@@ cas leads a d@@ azz@@ ling demo of Photos@@ yn@@ th, software that could transform the way we look at digital images. Using still photos cul@@ led from the Web, Photos@@ yn@@ th builds breath@@ taking dream@@ s@@ cap@@ es and lets us navigate them.
Bla@@ ise Ag@@ ü@@ era y Ar@@ cas@@ : How Pho@@ to@@ S@@ yn@@ th can connect the world's images.
What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some found@@ ational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an ac@@ quisi@@ tion almost exactly a year ago. This is Se@@ adr@@ ag@@ on, and it's an environment in which you can either loc@@ ally or remo@@ tely interact with vast amounts of visual data.
We're looking at many, many gig@@ abytes of digital photos here and kind of seam@@ lessly and continu@@ ously zo@@ om@@ ing in, pan@@ ning through it, re@@ arr@@ anging it in any way we want.
And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the images are.
Most of them are ordinary digital camera pho@@ tos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congr@@ ess, and it's in the 300 meg@@ ap@@ ix@@ el range.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pix@@ els on your screen at any given moment.
It's also very flexible architecture.
This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-@@ image data.
This is "B@@ le@@ ak Hou@@ se@@ " by D@@ ick@@ ens. Every column is a chap@@ ter.
To prove to you that it's really tex@@ t, and not an image, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real representation of the text@@ ; it's not a picture.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-@@ book.
I wouldn't recommend it.
This is a more realistic case, an issue of The Guardi@@ an.
Every large image is the beginning of a sec@@ tion.
And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-@@ scale kind of medium.
We've done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardi@@ an.
We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution - much higher than in an ordinary ad - and we've embedded extra content.
If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even technical specific@@ ations.
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real est@@ ate.
We hope that this means no more pop@@ -@@ ups and other rub@@ b@@ ish like that - shouldn't be necessary.
Of course, mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this.
And this one I really won't spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well.
But those are all the roads in the U.S.
Super@@ imposed on top of a NASA ge@@ os@@ pati@@ al image.
So let's pull up, now, something else.
This is actually live on the Web now@@ ; you can go check it out.
This is a project called Photos@@ yn@@ th, which marri@@ es two different technologies.
One of them is Se@@ adr@@ ag@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer-@@ vision research done by No@@ ah S@@ n@@ avel@@ y, a graduate student at the University of Washington, co-@@ advis@@ ed by Steve Se@@ it@@ z at U.@@ W.
And Rick S@@ zel@@ is@@ ki at Microsoft Resear@@ ch. A very nice collabor@@ ation.
And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Se@@ adr@@ ag@@ on.
You can see that when we do these sorts of view@@ s, where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-@@ resolution experience.
But the spatial arrang@@ ement of the images here is actually meaning@@ ful.
The computer vision algorithms have regis@@ tered these images together so that they cor@@ respond to the real space in which these shots - all taken near Gr@@ ass@@ i La@@ kes in the Canadian Rock@@ ies - all these shots were tak@@ en. So you see elements here of stabil@@ ized sl@@ ide@@ -@@ show or panor@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing, and these things have all been related spati@@ ally.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments.
Some are much more spati@@ al.
I would like to jump straight to one of No@@ ah@@ 's original dat@@ a-@@ sets - this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer - to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photos@@ yn@@ th technology, It's not necessarily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environments we've put up on the website.
We had to worry about the lawyers and so on.
This is a re@@ construction of No@@ tre D@@ ame Ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al that was done entirely comput@@ ation@@ ally from images scr@@ a@@ ped from Flick@@ r.
You just type No@@ tre D@@ ame into Flick@@ r, and you get some pictures of guys in T-@@ shir@@ ts, and of the campus and so on.
And each of these orange con@@ es represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model.
And so these are all Flickr images, and they've all been related spati@@ ally in this way.
We can just navigate in this very simple way.
You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsof@@ t.
It's very grati@@ fying to have this kind of rece@@ ption here.
I guess you can see this is lots of different types of camer@@ as: it's everything from cell@@ -@@ phone cameras to professional S@@ L@@ R@@ s, quite a large number of them, sti@@ t@@ ched together in this environment.
If I can find some of the sort of weird ones - So many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces, and so on.
Some@@ where in here there is actually a series of photographs - here we go.
This is actually a poster of No@@ tre D@@ ame that regis@@ tered correc@@ tly.
We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment.
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment.
This is now taking data from everybody - from the entire collective memory, visu@@ ally, of what the Earth looks like - and link all of that together.
Those photos become link@@ ed, and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts.
You have a model that emerg@@ es of the entire Earth.
Think of this as the long tail to Stephen L@@ aw@@ l@@ er's Virtual Earth work.
And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it, and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it.
Their own photos are getting tagged with me@@ ta-@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed.
If somebody bo@@ thered to tag all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are, then my photo of No@@ tre D@@ ame Ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al suddenly gets en@@ ric@@ hed with all of that data, and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space, into that me@@ ta-@@ ver@@ se, using everybody else's pho@@ tos, and do a kind of a cross-@@ mod@@ al and cross-@@ user social experience that way.
And of course, a by-@@ product of all of that is immen@@ sely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collected not just from over@@ head f@@ lights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory.
Thank you so much.
Chris Anderson: Do I understand this right? What your software is going to al@@ low, is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together@@ ?
B@@ A@@ A: Yes. What this is really doing is discover@@ ing, creating hyper@@ lin@@ ks, if you will, between images.
It's doing that based on the content inside the images.
And that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the seman@@ tic information a lot of images have.
Like when you do a web search for images, you type in phras@@ es, and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of.
What if that picture links to all of your pic@@ tur@@ es?
The amount of seman@@ tic inter@@ connection and rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really hu@@ ge.
It's a classic network effect.
CA: Tr@@ uly incredible. Congr@@ atul@@ ations.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: With stunning photos and stories, National Geographic Explor@@ er W@@ ade Dav@@ is celebr@@ ates the extraordinary diversity of the world's indigenous cultures, which are disappear@@ ing from the planet at an alarm@@ ing rate.
W@@ ade Dav@@ is: Dre@@ ams from endangered cultur@@ es.
You know, one of the intense pleas@@ ures of travel and one of the del@@ ights of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past in the wind, touch it in stones pol@@ ished by rain, taste it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants.
Just to know that J@@ agu@@ ar sham@@ ans still journey beyond the Milky W@@ ay, or the my@@ ths of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still reson@@ ate with meaning, or that in the Himalay@@ a, the Budd@@ hist@@ s still pursue the breath of the D@@ har@@ ma, is to really remember the central revel@@ ation of anthrop@@ ology, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense, but is just one model of reality.
The consequence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our lin@@ e@@ age made, al@@ be@@ it success@@ fully, many generations ago.
And of course, we all share the same adap@@ tive imper@@ atives.
We're all born. We all bring our children into the world.
We go through initi@@ ation rit@@ es.
We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separation of death, so it shouldn't surprise us that we all s@@ ing, we all dance, we all have art.
But what's interesting is the unique cad@@ ence of the song, the rhythm of the dance in every culture.
And whether it is the Pen@@ an in the forests of Bor@@ ne@@ o, or the Vo@@ od@@ oo a@@ col@@ y@@ tes in Haiti, or the warri@@ ors in the K@@ ais@@ ut desert of Northern Kenya, the Cur@@ and@@ ero in the mountains of the An@@ des, or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ ai in the middle of the Sahara - this is incident@@ ally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago - or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the slo@@ pes of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma.
Ever@@ est, the god@@ des@@ s mother of the world.
All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being, other ways of thinking, other ways of orient@@ ing yourself in the Earth.
And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only fill you with hope.
Now, together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envel@@ ops the planet, and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bios@@ p@@ here.
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ nos@@ phere, and you might define the eth@@ nos@@ phere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myth@@ s, ideas, inspir@@ ations, intui@@ tions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.
The eth@@ nos@@ phere is humanit@@ y's great leg@@ acy.
It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonish@@ ingly in@@ quisi@@ tive species.
And just as the bios@@ phere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded, so too is the eth@@ nos@@ phere - and, if anything, at a far greater rate.
No biolog@@ ists, for example, would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brin@@ k of extinction because it simply is not true, and yet that - the most apoc@@ al@@ yp@@ tic scenario in the realm of biological diversity - scar@@ c@@ ely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity.
And the great indic@@ ator of that, of course, is language loss.
When each of you in this room were born, there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a body of vocabul@@ ary or a set of gram@@ ma@@ tical rules.
A language is a flash of the human spir@@ it.
It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world.
Every language is an old-@@ growth forest of the mind, a water@@ sh@@ ed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monter@@ ey, fully half are no longer being whis@@ per@@ ed into the ears of children.
They're no longer being taught to babies, which means, effec@@ tively, unless something changes, they're already dead.
What could be more lonely than to be envel@@ oped in sil@@ ence, to be the last of your people to speak your language, to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the childr@@ en?
And yet, that dre@@ ad@@ ful fate is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks, some el@@ der dies and carries with him into the grave the last syl@@ lab@@ les of an ancient ton@@ gue.
And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one langu@@ ag@@ e?" And I say, "@@ Gre@@ at, let's make that language Yor@@ ub@@ a. Let's make it Cant@@ on@@ ese.
Let's make it Ko@@ gi@@ ."
And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language.
And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ nos@@ phere, a brief journey through the eth@@ nos@@ phere, to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.
Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say "@@ different ways of be@@ ing," I really do mean different ways of being.
T@@ ake, for example, this child of a Bar@@ as@@ ana in the Nor@@ thwest Amazon, the people of the an@@ acon@@ da who believe that myth@@ olog@@ ically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred sn@@ ak@@ es.
Now, this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heav@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depen@@ d.
They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called "@@ lingu@@ istic ex@@ og@@ amy@@ :@@ " you must marry someone who speaks a different language.
And this is all rooted in the myth@@ ological past, yet the curious thing is in these long houses, where there are six or seven languages spoken because of inter@@ marri@@ age, you never hear anyone practicing a language.
They simply listen and then begin to speak.
Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with, the Wa@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ as@@ tern E@@ cu@@ ador, an astonishing people first contacted peac@@ eful@@ ly in 195@@ 8.
In 195@@ 7, five mission@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a critical mistake.
They dropped from the air 8 x 10 gl@@ oss@@ y photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gest@@ ures, for@@ getting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives.
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the fig@@ ure, found nothing, and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the dev@@ il, so they spe@@ ared the five mission@@ aries to death.
But the Wa@@ or@@ ani didn't just spe@@ ar out@@ sider@@ s.
They spe@@ ared each other.
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ aring each other.
We trac@@ ed gene@@ alo@@ gi@@ es back eight generations, and we found two inst@@ ances of natural death and when we press@@ ured the people a little bit about it, they admit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lows had gotten so old that he died getting old, so we spe@@ ared him anyway. But at the same time they had a pers@@ pic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was astonish@@ ing.
Their hun@@ ters could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind.
In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of Du@@ vali@@ er's strength and Ton@@ ton Ma@@ co@@ ut@@ es, and secur@@ ing the poison used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es.
In order to make sense out of sens@@ ation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of V@@ od@@ oun@@ . And Vo@@ od@@ oo is not a black magic cul@@ t.
On the contr@@ ary, it's a complex metap@@ h@@ ys@@ ical world@@ view.
It's interesting.
If I asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world, what would you say?
Christi@@ an@@ ity, Isl@@ am, Buddh@@ ism, Jud@@ ais@@ m, whatever.
There's always one continent left out, the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious belief@@ s. Well, of course, they did and Vo@@ od@@ oo is simply the dis@@ til@@ l@@ ation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the slavery era.
But, what makes Vo@@ od@@ oo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead.
So, the living give birth to the spir@@ its.
The spir@@ its can be inv@@ o@@ ked from beneath the Great Wat@@ er, responding to the rhythm of the dance to moment@@ arily dis@@ place the soul of the living, so that for that brief shining moment, the a@@ col@@ y@@ te becomes the g@@ od.
That's why the Vo@@ od@@ oo@@ ists like to say that "You white people go to church and speak about God.
We dance in the tem@@ ple and become God@@ ."
And because you are poss@@ esse@@ d, you are taken by the spirit - how can you be har@@ med@@ ?
So you see these astonishing demonstr@@ ation@@ s: Vo@@ od@@ oo a@@ col@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling burning emb@@ ers with im@@ pun@@ ity, a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when cataly@@ zed in the state of extreme excit@@ ation.
Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with, the most extraordinary are the K@@ og@@ i of the Sierra Nev@@ ada de Santa Mar@@ ta in northern Colom@@ bia.
D@@ esc@@ end@@ ants of the ancient T@@ air@@ ona civilization which once carpe@@ ted the Caribbe@@ an coastal plain of Colom@@ bia, in the wake of the con@@ quest@@ , these people re@@ treated into an isolated volcanic massi@@ f that so@@ ars above the Caribbe@@ an coastal pl@@ ain.
In a blood@@ st@@ ained contin@@ ent, these people alone were never con@@ quer@@ ed by the Span@@ ish.
To this day, they remain ru@@ led by a ritual pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the training for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood is rather extraordinary.
The young a@@ col@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four, sequ@@ ester@@ ed in a shado@@ w@@ y world of darkness in stone hut@@ s at the base of glaci@@ ers for 18 year@@ s: two nine-@@ year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gest@@ ation they spend in their natural mother's w@@ om@@ b@@ ; now they are metaphor@@ ically in the w@@ om@@ b of the great mother.
And for this entire time, they are in@@ cultur@@ ated into the values of their society, values that maintain the pro@@ position that their pray@@ ers and their pray@@ ers alone maintain the cosmic - or we might say the ecological - balance.
And at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation, one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18, they see a sun@@ ris@@ e. And in that cryst@@ al moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to ba@@ the the slo@@ pes of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape, suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is af@@ fir@@ med in stunning gl@@ or@@ y. And the pri@@ est steps back.
And says, "You see? It's really as I've told you.
It is that beautiful. It is yours to protec@@ t."
They call themselves the "@@ el@@ der brother@@ s" and they say we, who are the younger brother@@ s, are the ones responsible for destroying the world.
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.
Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape, we either inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the "@@ no@@ ble sav@@ age@@ ," which is an idea rac@@ ist in its simplic@@ ity, or altern@@ ati@@ vely, we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ ore@@ au and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.
Well, indigenous people are neither senti@@ mental nor weak@@ ened by nostal@@ gia.
There's not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ arial sw@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ illing winds of Tibe@@ t, but they have, neverth@@ eless, through time and ritu@@ al, for@@ ged a traditional my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consciously close to it, but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intui@@ tion: the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breath@@ ed into being by human consciousness.
Now, what does that mean?
It means that a young kid from the An@@ des who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Ap@@ u spirit that will direct his or her destin@@ y will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be min@@ ed.
Whether it's the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pile of ore is irre@@ levant@@ .
What's interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world.
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut@@ .
That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those forests were the abo@@ de of Hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the Cro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ ak of He@@ av@@ en and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spir@@ its that d@@ wel@@ led at the north end of the world, spir@@ its they would have to engage during their Ham@@ at@@ sa initi@@ ation.
Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different real@@ ities, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discover@@ ies. Take this plant here.
It's a photograph I took in the Nor@@ thwest Amazon just last Apr@@ il.
This is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca, which many of you have heard about, the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sham@@ an's reperto@@ ire@@ .
What makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the sheer pharma@@ colog@@ ical potential of this prepar@@ ation, but the elabor@@ ation of it. It's made really of two different sourc@@ es: on the one hand, this wo@@ ody li@@ ana which has in it a series of be@@ ta-@@ car@@ bol@@ ines, har@@ mine, har@@ mal@@ ine, mil@@ dly hallucin@@ ogen@@ ic - to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue haz@@ y smoke dri@@ ft across your consciousness - but it's mixed with the leaves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the coffee family.
Cal@@ led Psy@@ cho@@ tr@@ ia vir@@ id@@ is.
This plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines, very close to brain seroton@@ in, di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine, 5@@ -@@ meth@@ oxy@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine.
If you've ever seen the Y@@ anom@@ ami blowing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their nos@@ es, that substance they make from a different set of species also contains meth@@ oxy@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine.
To have that pow@@ der blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le barre@@ l lined with bar@@ o@@ que paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. It doesn't create the distor@@ tion of real@@ ity; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality.
In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Sh@@ ul@@ tes - who is a man who spar@@ ked the psych@@ ed@@ el@@ ic era with his discovery of the magic mush@@ rooms in Mexico in the 1930@@ s - I used to argue that you couldn't classi@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as hallucin@@ ogen@@ ic because by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucin@@ ation. But the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally.
Because they're den@@ ature@@ d by an enzy@@ me found naturally in the human gut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine oxid@@ as@@ e.
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in conjun@@ c@@ tion with some other chemical that den@@ atures the MA@@ O.
Now, the fascinating things are that the be@@ ta-@@ car@@ bol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are MA@@ O inh@@ ib@@ it@@ ors of the precise sort necessary to potenti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine. So you ask yourself a question.
Ho@@ w, in a fl@@ ora of 80,000 species of vas@@ cular plants, do these people find these two morph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ related plants that when combined in this way, created a kind of bi@@ och@@ em@@ ical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the part@@ s?
Well, we use that great e@@ up@@ hemis@@ m, "@@ trial and err@@ or@@ ," which is exposed to be mean@@ ingl@@ ess.
But you ask the Indi@@ ans, and they say, "The plants talk to us."
Well, what does that mean?
This tri@@ be, the C@@ of@@ an, has 17 vari@@ e@@ ties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca, all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest, all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species.
And then you ask them how they establish their tax@@ on@@ omy and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants.
I mean, don't you know any@@ thing@@ ?" And I said, "No."
Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 vari@@ e@@ ties in the night of a full moon, and it s@@ ings to you in a different key.
Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting stam@@ ens. Now - - the problem - the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ thetic with the p@@ light of indigenous people view them as qu@@ aint and color@@ ful but somehow reduced to the marg@@ ins of history as the real world, meaning our world, moves on.
Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now, is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innov@@ ations, but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively end@@ or@@ sed or passi@@ vely accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.
All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology itself.
The Siou@@ x Indians did not stop being Siou@@ x when they gave up the bow and arro@@ w any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and bu@@ gg@@ y.
It's not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integr@@ ity of the eth@@ nos@@ p@@ here. It is power, the crude face of domin@@ ation.
Wher@@ ever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destin@@ ed to f@@ ade a@@ way@@ ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to: whether it's the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous deforestation in the homel@@ and of the Pen@@ an - a no@@ mad@@ ic people from Sou@@ theast Asia, from Sar@@ awa@@ k - a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago.
And now have all been reduced to serv@@ itude and prostitu@@ tion on the banks of the ri@@ vers, where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the sil@@ t that seems to be carrying half of Bor@@ ne@@ o away to the South China Se@@ a, where the Japanese fre@@ igh@@ ters hang light in the horiz@@ on ready to fill their holds with raw log@@ s ri@@ pped from the forest - or, in the case of the Y@@ anom@@ ami.
It's the disease enti@@ ties that have come in, in the wake of the discovery of gol@@ d.
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibe@@ t, where I'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political domin@@ ation.
You know, genocid@@ e, the physical extinction of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned, but eth@@ n@@ ocid@@ e, the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned, it's univers@@ ally, in many quar@@ ters, celebrated as part of a development strategy.
And you cannot understand the pain of Ti@@ bet until you move through it at the ground level.
I once travel@@ led 6,000 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in Western China over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ as@@ tern Ti@@ bet to L@@ has@@ a with a young colleagu@@ e, and it was only when I got to L@@ has@@ a that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about: 6,000 sacred mon@@ uments tor@@ n apart to dust and ash@@ es, 1.2 million people killed by the cad@@ res during the Cul@@ tural Revolution.
This young man's father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the Pan@@ ch@@ en L@@ ama.
That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invas@@ ion.
His uncle f@@ led with His Hol@@ iness in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to Nep@@ al.
His mother was incarcer@@ ated for the crime of being wealth@@ y.
He was smu@@ gg@@ led into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn't bear to be without him.
The sister who had done that brave de@@ ed was put into an education cam@@ p.
One day she in@@ adver@@ tent@@ ly stepped on an ar@@ mb@@ and of Ma@@ o, and for that trans@@ gress@@ ion, she was given seven years of hard labor.
The pain of Ti@@ bet can be impossible to be@@ ar, but the re@@ dem@@ p@@ tive spirit of the people is something to be@@ hold.
And in the end, then, it really comes down to a cho@@ ice: do we want to live in a mon@@ och@@ ro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embrace a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of divers@@ ity?
Margaret Me@@ ad, the great anthrop@@ ologist, said, before she died, that her greatest fear was that as we drif@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly amor@@ ph@@ ous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow mod@@ ality of thought, but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities.
And it's hum@@ bling to remember that our species has, perhaps, been around for [@@ 1@@ 50@@ ,000@@ ] years.
The Ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic Revolution - which gave us agriculture, at which time we succ@@ um@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed; the poetry of the sham@@ an was dis@@ placed by the pr@@ ose of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od@@ ; we created hierarchy speci@@ alization sur@@ plus - is only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old.
Now, that sh@@ allow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the en@@ su@@ ing millen@@ nia.
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different vo@@ ices.
And it's within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are@@ : a fully conscious species, fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peoples and all gar@@ d@@ ens find a way to flour@@ ish. And there are great moments of optim@@ ism.
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of B@@ af@@ f@@ in Island when I went nar@@ wh@@ al hunting with some In@@ u@@ it people, and this man, O@@ lay@@ u@@ k, told me a marvel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father.
The Canadian government has not always been kind to the In@@ u@@ it people, and during the 1950@@ s, to establish our sovere@@ ign@@ ty, we forced them into settle@@ ments.
This old man's grandfather refused to go.
The family, fear@@ ful for his life, took away all of his weapons, all of his tools.
Now, you must understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fear the col@@ d; they took advantage of it.
The run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were originally made of fish wrapped in car@@ ib@@ ou hid@@ e.
So, this man's grandfather was not intimid@@ ated by the Arctic night or the b@@ liz@@ z@@ ard that was blow@@ ing.
He simply sli@@ pped outside, pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin trou@@ ser@@ s and defe@@ ca@@ ted into his hand. And as the fec@@ es began to freez@@ e, he shaped it into the form of a bl@@ ade.
He put a spray of sal@@ iva on the edge of the sh@@ it knife and as it finally fro@@ ze sol@@ id, he but@@ ch@@ ered a dog with it.
He skin@@ ned the dog and improvis@@ ed a har@@ ness, took the rib@@ ca@@ ge of the dog and improvis@@ ed a sle@@ d, har@@ nessed up an adjac@@ ent dog, and disappeared over the ice flo@@ es, sh@@ it knife in bel@@ t.
Talk about getting by with nothing. And this, in many ways - - is a symbol of the resilience of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all indigenous people around the world.
The Canadian government in A@@ pri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the In@@ u@@ it an area of land larger than California and Texas put together.
It's our new homel@@ and. It's called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut.
It's an independent territor@@ y. They control all min@@ eral resources.
An amazing example of how a nation-@@ state can seek res@@ titu@@ tion with its people.
And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet, to realize that they're not remote at all.
They're homel@@ ands of some@@ body.
They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of the naked geo@@ graphy of hope.
So, what we're trying to do at the National Geograph@@ ic, finally, is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.
We think that po@@ le@@ mic@@ s - - we think that po@@ le@@ mic@@ s are not persuas@@ ive, but we think that storytelling can change the world, and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month.
15@@ 6 nations carry our television channel@@ .
Our magaz@@ ines are read by milli@@ ons.
And what we're doing is a series of journe@@ ys to the eth@@ nos@@ phere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away d@@ azz@@ led by what they have seen, and hope@@ fully, therefore, embrace gradu@@ ally, one by one, the central revel@@ ation of anthrop@@ olog@@ y: that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live in a truly multicul@@ tur@@ al, plur@@ alistic world.
Where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being.
Thank you very much.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Psy@@ ch@@ ologist B@@ arry Schwar@@ tz takes aim at a central ten@@ et of western socie@@ ti@@ es: freedom of choice. In Schwar@@ tz@@ 's estima@@ tion, choice has made us not fre@@ er but more paraly@@ z@@ ed, not happier but more dis@@ satis@@ fied.
B@@ arry Schwar@@ t@@ z: The paradox of choice.
I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that I hope will reson@@ ate with other things you've already heard, and I'll try to make some connections myself, in case you missed them.
But I want to start with what I call the "@@ official dog@@ ma@@ ."
The official dog@@ ma of what?
The official dog@@ ma of all Western industrial societies.
And the official dog@@ ma runs like this: if we are interested in maxim@@ izing the welfare of our citizens, the way to do that is to maxim@@ ize individual freedom.
The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good, valu@@ able, worth@@ while, essential to being human.
And because if people have freedom, then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maxim@@ ize our wel@@ far@@ e, and no one has to decide on our be@@ half.
The way to maxim@@ ize freedom is to maxim@@ ize choice.
The more choice people have, the more freedom they have, and the more freedom they have, the more welfare they have.
This, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it.
And it's also deeply embedded in our lives.
I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us.
This is my super@@ market. Not such a big one.
I want to say just a word about sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ing.
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings in my super@@ market, if you don't count the 10 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ gin ol@@ ive o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic vin@@ eg@@ ars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings, in the off-@@ chance that none of the 17@@ 5 the store has on offer suit you.
So this is what the super@@ market is like.
And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stere@@ o system - speak@@ ers, CD play@@ er, tape play@@ er, tun@@ er, ampli@@ fi@@ er - and in this one single consumer electronics store, there are that many stere@@ o systems.
We can construct six@@ -and-@@ a-@@ half-@@ million different stere@@ o systems out of the components that are on offer in one store.
You've got to admit that's a lot of choice.
In other doma@@ ins - the world of communic@@ ations.
There was a time, when I was a boy, when you could get any kind of telephone service you wan@@ ted, as long as it came from M@@ a B@@ ell.
You r@@ ented your phone. You didn't buy it.
One consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never bro@@ ke.
And those days are gone.
We now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones, especially in the world of cell phones.
These are cell phones of the future.
My favorite is the middle one - the MP@@ 3 play@@ er, nose hair tr@@ im@@ mer, and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ lé@@ e tor@@ ch.
And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet, you can rest as@@ sured that one day soon, you will.
And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question.
And do you know what the answer to this question now is?
The answer is "@@ no@@ ."
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.
So, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things, the same explosion of choice is true.
Health care. It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B.
A has these benef@@ its, and these ris@@ ks.
B has these benef@@ its, and these ris@@ ks. What do you want to do?"
And you say, "D@@ oc@@ , what should I do?"
And the do@@ c says, "A has these benefits and ris@@ ks, and B has these benefits and ris@@ ks.
What do you want to do?"
And you say, "If you were me, Doc@@ , what would you do?"
And the do@@ c says, "But I'm not you."
And the result is - we call it "@@ patient autonom@@ y," which makes it sound like a good thing, but it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something - namely, the doctor - to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions - namely, the patient.
There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me, which, if you think about it, makes no sense at all, since we can't buy them.
Why do they market to us if we can't buy them?
The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescrip@@ tions to be changed.
Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice, as this slide is meant to indic@@ ate.
We don't inher@@ it an identi@@ ty@@ ; we get to invent it.
And we get to re-@@ invent ourselves as often as we like.
And that means that every day, when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
With respect to marriage and family, there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could, and then you started having kids as soon as you could.
The only real choice was who, not when, and not what you did after.
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays, everything is very much up for grab@@ s.
I teach wonder@@ fully intelligent students, and I ass@@ ign 20 percent less work than I used to.
And it's not because they're less smart, and it's not because they're less di@@ lig@@ ent.
It's because they are pre@@ occupi@@ ed, asking themselves, "S@@ h@@ ould I get married or not? Should I get married now?
Should I get married lat@@ er? Should I have kids first, or a career first@@ ?"
All of these are consuming questions.
And they're going to answer these questions, whether or not it means not doing all the work I ass@@ ign and not getting a good grade in my cour@@ ses.
And indeed they shoul@@ d. These are important questions to answer.
Wor@@ k - we are bl@@ esse@@ d, as Carl was pointing out, with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet - except the Rand@@ ol@@ ph Ho@@ tel@@ .
There is one corner, by the way, that I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the Wi@@ F@@ i actually works.
I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it.
So what this means, this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work, is that we have to make a decision, again and again and again, about whether we should or shouldn't be working.
We can go to watch our kid play soc@@ cer, and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p, and our Black@@ berry on our other hi@@ p, and our laptop, pres@@ uma@@ bly, on our lap@@ s.
And even if they're all shut off, every minute that we're watching our kid mutil@@ ate a soccer game, we are also asking ourselves, "S@@ h@@ ould I answer this cell phone call@@ ?
Should I respond to this ema@@ il@@ ? Should I dr@@ aft this let@@ ter@@ ?"
And even if the answer to the question is "@@ no@@ ," it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid@@ 's soccer game very different than it would@@ 've been.
So everywhere we look, big things and small things, material things and lifestyle things, life is a matter of choice.
And the world we used to live in looked like this.
That is to say, there were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choice.
And the world we now live in looks like this. [@@ The Ten Com@@ mand@@ ments D@@ Y@@ I K@@ it@@ ] And the question is, is this good news, or bad new@@ s?
And the answer is, "@@ y@@ es."
We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.
All of this choice has two effects, two negative effects on people.
One effect, paradox@@ ically, is that it produces paralys@@ is, rather than liber@@ ation.
With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all.
I'll give you one very dramatic example of this: a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plan@@ s.
A colleague of mine got access to investment records from V@@ angu@@ ard, the gig@@ antic mutu@@ al-@@ fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different work@@ places.
And what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tual funds the employ@@ er offer@@ ed, rate of participation went down two percent.
You offer 50 funds - 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five. Why?
Because with 50 funds to choose from, it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choos@@ e, that you'll just put it off until tomorrow.
And then tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and of course tomorrow never com@@ es.
Under@@ stand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don't have enough money put away, it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the employ@@ er.
By not particip@@ ating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employ@@ er, who would happily match their contribu@@ tion.
So paralys@@ is is a consequence of having too many choices.
And I think it makes the world look like this.
You really want to get the decision right if it's for all etern@@ ity, right?
You don't want to pick the wrong mu@@ tual fund@@ , or the wrong sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ing.
So that's one effect. The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralys@@ is and make a choice, we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from.
And there are several reasons for this.
One of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings to choose from, if you buy one, and it's not perfect - and what sal@@ ad dr@@ essing is? - it's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is this imagined alternative induc@@ es you to regret the decision you made, and this regret sub@@ trac@@ ts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made.
Even if it was a good decision.
The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disap@@ pointing about the option that you chos@@ e.
Second, what economists call "@@ opportunity cost@@ s."
Dan Gil@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to.
Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consid@@ er, it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you rejec@@ t that make you less satis@@ fied with the alternative that you've chos@@ en.
Here's an example. [@@ I can't stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 8@@ 5@@ th street@@ ] Sor@@ ry if you're not New York@@ ers.
Here's what you're supposed to be thinking.
Here's this couple on the Ham@@ pt@@ ons.
Very expensive real est@@ ate.
Gor@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach. Be@@ auti@@ ful day. They have it all to themselves.
What could be better?
"Well, damn it@@ ," this guy is thinking, "It's Aug@@ us@@ t. Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.
I could be parking right in front of my build@@ ing."
And he spends two weeks n@@ ag@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity, day after day, to have a great parking space.
Op@@ portun@@ ity costs sub@@ tract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choos@@ e, even when what we choose is terri@@ fic@@ .
And the more options there are to consid@@ er, the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs.
Here's another example.
Now this cartoon makes a lot of points.
It makes points about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things slow@@ ly.
But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing, you're choosing not to do other things that may have lots of attractive featur@@ es, and it's going to make what you're doing less attrac@@ tive.
Thir@@ d: escal@@ ation of expect@@ ations.
This hit me when I went to replace my je@@ ans.
I wear jeans almost all the time.
There was a time when jeans came in one flav@@ or, and you bought them, and they fit like cr@@ ap, they were incredibly uncomfort@@ able, if you wore them and washed them enough times, they started to feel OK.
I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones, and I said, "I want a pair of je@@ ans. Here's my siz@@ e."
And the sho@@ p@@ keep@@ er said, "Do you want sli@@ m f@@ it, easy f@@ it, relax@@ ed f@@ it?
You want button fly or z@@ ip@@ per fl@@ y? You want st@@ one@@ washed or acid@@ -@@ was@@ h@@ ed?
Do you want them distr@@ esse@@ d?
You want boo@@ t cut, ta@@ per@@ ed, bl@@ ah bl@@ ah@@ ." On and on he w@@ ent.
My ja@@ w drop@@ ped. And after I recover@@ ed, I said, "I want the kind that used to be the only kin@@ d."
He had no idea what that was, so I spent an hour trying on all these damn je@@ ans, and I walked out of the store - truth@@ ! - with the best-@@ fit@@ ting jeans I had ever had. I did better.
All this choice made it possible for me to do better.
But - I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself.
The reason I felt worse is that, with all of these options available, my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up.
I had very low, no particular expectations when they only came in one flav@@ or.
When they came in 100 flav@@ ors, damn it, one of them shoul@@ d@@ 've been perfect.
And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect.
And so I compared what I got to what I expec@@ ted, and what I got was disap@@ pointing in comparison to what I expected.
Ad@@ ding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be.
And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results, even when they're good results.
Nobody in the world of marketing knows this.
Because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about.
The truth is more like this.
[@@ Everything was better back when everything was wor@@ se@@ ] The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse, it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise.
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays, the world we live in - we af@@ flu@@ ent, industri@@ alized citizens, with perfec@@ tion the expect@@ ation - the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be.
You will never be pleas@@ antly surprised because your expect@@ ations, my expect@@ ations, have gone through the ro@@ of.
The secret to happiness - this is what you all came for - the secret to happiness is low expect@@ ations.
I want to say - just a little autobio@@ graph@@ ical moment - that I actually am married to a wife, and she's really quite wonderful.
I couldn't have done better.
But sett@@ ling isn't always such a bad thing.
Fin@@ ally - One consequence of buying a bad@@ -@@ fit@@ ting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied, and you ask why, who's responsi@@ ble, the answer is clear@@ : the world is responsi@@ ble.
What could you do?
When there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of jeans available, and you buy one that is disap@@ poin@@ ting, and you ask why, who's responsi@@ ble@@ ?
It is equally clear that the answer to the question is "@@ you."
You could have done better.
With a hundred different kinds of jeans on dis@@ play, there is no excuse for failure.
And so when people make decisions, and even though the results of the decisions are good, they blame themselves.
Clin@@ ical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation.
I believe a significant - not the only, but a significant - contrib@@ utor to this explosion of depression, and also suic@@ ide, is that people have experiences that are disap@@ pointing because their standards are so high, and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves, they think they're at faul@@ t.
And so the net result is that we do better in general, objec@@ tively, and we feel worse.
So let me remind you.
This is the official dog@@ ma, the one that we all take to be true, and it's all fal@@ se. It is not true.
There's no question that some choice is better than n@@ one, but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice.
There's some magical amoun@@ t. I don't know what it is.
I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our wel@@ far@@ e.
Now, as a policy matter - I'm almost done - as a policy matter, the thing to think about is this: what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material af@@ flu@@ ence.
There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choice.
Their problem is that they have too little.
So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of moder@@ n, af@@ flu@@ ent, Western societies.
And what is so frustr@@ ating and in@@ furi@@ ating is this: Steve L@@ evit@@ t talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficul@@ t-@@ to-@@ install child seats don't help.
What I'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices - it's not simply that they don't help.
They actually hur@@ t.
They actually make us worse off.
If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options, not only would those people's lives be impro@@ ved, but ours would be improved also, which is what economists call a "Par@@ e@@ to-@@ improving mo@@ ve."
In@@ come re@@ distribution will make everyone better off - not just poor people - because of how all this exc@@ ess choice pl@@ agu@@ es us.
So to conclu@@ de. [@@ You can be anything you want to be - no limit@@ s] You're supposed to read this carto@@ on, and, being a sophisticated person, say, "A@@ h! What does this fish know?
You know, nothing is possible in this fish@@ bow@@ l@@ ."
Im@@ pover@@ ished imagination, a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world - and that's the way I read it at first.
The more I thought about it, however, the more I came to the view that this fish knows something.
Because the truth of the matter is that if you shat@@ ter the fish@@ bowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom. You have paralys@@ is.
If you shat@@ ter this fish@@ bowl so that everything is possible, you decrease satisfac@@ tion.
You increase paralys@@ is, and you decrease satisfac@@ tion.
Everybody needs a fish@@ bow@@ l.
This one is almost certainly too limited - perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us.
But the absence of some metaphor@@ ical fish@@ bowl is a recipe for miser@@ y, and, I suspec@@ t, disaster.
Thank you very much.
S@@ aj@@ ay Sam@@ u@@ el: How college loans exploit students for profit.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: "@@ Once upon a time in Americ@@ a," says professor S@@ aj@@ ay Sam@@ u@@ el, "@@ going to college did not mean gradu@@ ating with deb@@ t." Today, higher education has become a consumer product - costs have sky@@ roc@@ ke@@ ted, s@@ add@@ ling students with a combined debt of over $@@ 1 trilli@@ on, while universities and loan companies make massive prof@@ its. Samuel propos@@ es a radical solu@@ tion: link tu@@ ition costs to a degre@@ e's expected ear@@ n@@ ings, so that students can make informed decisions about their future, restore their love of learning and contribute to the world in a meaningful way.
Today 40 million Americans are in@@ deb@@ ted for their pass@@ age to the new economy.
Too poor to pay their way through college, they now owe lend@@ ers more than one trillion US dollars.
They do find what jobs they can get to pay off a debt that is sec@@ ured on their person.
In America, even a bank@@ rup@@ t gam@@ bl@@ er gets a second chance.
But it is nearly impossible for an American to get dis@@ charged their student loan deb@@ ts.
Once upon a time in America, going to college did not mean gradu@@ ating with deb@@ t.
My friend Paul@@ 's father graduated from Color@@ ado State University on the G@@ I B@@ ill.
For his generation, higher education was free or almost free, because it was thought of as a public good.
Not anymore.
When Paul also graduated from Color@@ ado State University, he paid for his English degree by working part@@ -@@ time.
30 years ago, higher education tu@@ ition was afford@@ able, reason@@ able, and what deb@@ ts you accumul@@ ated, you paid off by gradu@@ ation date.
Not anymore.
Paul@@ 's daughter followed in his foot@@ steps, but with one differ@@ ence: when she graduated five years ago, it was with a wh@@ op@@ ping deb@@ t.
Stud@@ ents like Kate have to take on a loan because the cost of higher education has become un@@ affordable for many if not most American families.
But so what?
Get@@ ting into debt to buy an expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off with the increased income that you earned from it.
But that's where the rubber meets the road.
Even a college gr@@ ad earned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 201@@ 3.
So ...
Tu@@ ition costs up, public funding down, family in@@ comes dimin@@ ished, personal in@@ comes wea@@ k.
Is it any wonder that more than a quarter of those who must cannot make their student loan pay@@ ment@@ s?
The worst of times can be the best of times, because certain truths flash up in ways that you can't ignor@@ e.
I want to speak of three of them today.
1.2 trillion dollars of deb@@ ts for diplo@@ mas make it abund@@ antly obvious that higher education is a consumer product you can bu@@ y.
All of us talk about education just as the economists do now, as an investment that you make to improve the human stock by training them for work.
As an investment you make to sort and classi@@ fy people so that employ@@ ers can hire them more easily.
The U.S. News &amp; World Re@@ port ran@@ ks colleg@@ es just as the consumer report rates washing machines.
The language is pe@@ pper@@ ed with bar@@ bar@@ ism@@ s.
Te@@ acher@@ s are called "@@ service provid@@ er@@ s," students are called "@@ consum@@ er@@ s."
Soci@@ ology and Shakespeare and soccer and science, all of these are "@@ cont@@ ent@@ ."
Stud@@ ent debt is prof@@ it@@ able.
Only not on you.
Your debt fat@@ tens the profit of the student loan industry.
The two 8@@ 00-@@ pound gor@@ ill@@ as of which - Sal@@ lie Ma@@ e and N@@ avi@@ ent - posted last year a combined profit of 1.2 billion dollars.
And just like home mortg@@ ages, student loans can be b@@ und@@ led and pack@@ aged and slic@@ ed and dic@@ ed, and sold on Wall Street.
And colleg@@ es and universities that invest in these se@@ curi@@ tiz@@ ed loans profit tw@@ ice.
Once from your tu@@ i@@ tion, and then again from the interest on deb@@ t.
With all that money to be made, are we surprised that some in the higher education business have begun to engage in false advertis@@ ing, in ba@@ it and switch ...
In explo@@ iting the very ignorance that they pretend to educa@@ te?
Thir@@ d: diplo@@ mas are a br@@ and.
Many years ago my teacher wrote, "When students are treated as consum@@ ers, they're made prisoners of addic@@ tion and en@@ v@@ y."
Just as consumers can be sold and res@@ old up@@ grad@@ ed versions of an iPhone, so also people can be sold more and more education.
College is the new high school, we already say that.
But why stop there?
People can be up@@ sold on certific@@ ations and re@@ certific@@ ations, mas@@ ter's degrees, doctor@@ al degrees.
High@@ er education is also marke@@ ted as a status object.
Bu@@ y a degre@@ e, much like you do a L@@ ex@@ us of a Louis V@@ u@@ it@@ ton bag@@ , to distinguish yourself from others.
So you can be the object of en@@ vy of others.
Di@@ plo@@ mas are a br@@ and.
But these truths are often times hidden by a very nois@@ y sales pit@@ ch. There is not a day that goes by "A college degree is absolutely essential to get on that up escal@@ ator to a middle-@@ class life."
And the usual evidence offered is the college premi@@ um: a college gr@@ ad who makes on average 56 percent more than a high school grad@@ .
Let's look at that number more carefully, because on the face of it, it seems to beli@@ e the stories we all hear about college grad@@ s working as bar@@ istas and cas@@ hi@@ ers.
Of 100 people who en@@ roll in any form of post-@@ secondary education, 45 do not complete it in a ti@@ mely fash@@ ion, for a number of reasons, including financi@@ al.
Of the 55 that do gradu@@ ate, two will remain unemploy@@ ed, and another 18 are under@@ employ@@ ed.
So, college grad@@ s earn more than high school grad@@ s, but does it pay for the ex@@ orbit@@ ant tu@@ ition and the lost w@@ ages while at colle@@ ge?
Now even economists admit going to college pays off for only those who complete it.
But that's only because high school w@@ ages have been cut to the bone, for decades now.
For decades, workers with a high school degree have been deni@@ ed a fair share of what they have produc@@ ed.
And had they received as they should have, then going to college would have been a bad investment for many.
College premi@@ um@@ ?
I think it's a high school dis@@ coun@@ t.
Two out of three people who en@@ roll are not going to find an adequ@@ ate job.
And the future, for them, doesn't look particularly promising - in fact, it's down@@ right ble@@ ak.
And it is they who are going to suffer the most pun@@ ishing forms of student deb@@ t.
And it is they, curi@@ ously and sad@@ ly, who are marke@@ ted most lou@@ dly about this college premi@@ um thing.
That's not just cy@@ n@@ ical marketing, that's cru@@ el.
So what do we do?
What if students and parents treated higher education as a consumer produc@@ t?
Everybody else seems to.
Then, like any other consumer product, you would demand to know what you're paying for.
When you buy medic@@ ines, you get a list of side effects.
When you buy a higher educational product, you should have a warning label that allows consumers to choos@@ e, make informed choices.
When you buy a car, it tells you how many miles per gall@@ on to expect.
Who knows what to expect from a degree say, in Canadian Stu@@ di@@ es.
There is such a thing, by the way.
What if there was an app for that?
One that linked up the cost of a major to the expected income.
Let's call it In@@ com@@ e-@@ Bas@@ ed Tu@@ ition or IB@@ T.
One of you make this.
Dis@@ cover your reality.
There are three advant@@ ages, three benefits to In@@ com@@ e-@@ Bas@@ ed Tu@@ i@@ tion.
Any user can figure out how much money he or she will make from a given college and maj@@ or.
Such informed users are unlikely to fall victim to the h@@ uck@@ ster@@ 's plo@@ y, to the sales pit@@ ch.
But also to choose wis@@ ely.
Why would anybody pay more for college than let's say, 15 percent of the additional income they ear@@ n@@ ?
There's a second benefit to In@@ com@@ e-@@ Bas@@ ed Tu@@ i@@ tion.
By t@@ ying the cost to the income, college adminis@@ trat@@ ors would be forced to manage costs better, to find innovative ways to do so.
For instance, all of you students here pay roughly the same tu@@ ition for every maj@@ or.
That is manifest@@ ly un@@ fa@@ ir, and should change.
An engineering student uses more resources and facilities and labs and facul@@ ty than a philosophy student.
But the philosophy student, as a consequ@@ ence, is subsid@@ izing the engineering student.
Who then, by the way, goes on and ear@@ ns more money.
Why should two people buy the same product, pay the same, but one person receive half or a third of the service.
In fact, college grad@@ s, some major@@ s, pay 25 percent of their income servic@@ ing their student deb@@ t, while others pay five percent.
That kind if in@@ equ@@ ity would end when maj@@ ors are pric@@ ed more correc@@ tly.
Now of course, all this data - and one of you is going to do this, right?
All this data has to be well desig@@ ned, maybe audi@@ ted by public accounting fir@@ ms to avoid statistical lies.
We know about statistics, right?
But be that as it ma@@ y, the third and biggest benefit of In@@ com@@ e-@@ Bas@@ ed Tu@@ i@@ tion, is it would free Americans from the fear and the fact of financial ru@@ in because they bought a defec@@ tive product.
Per@@ hap@@ s, in time, young and old Americans may re@@ discover@@ , as the gentleman said earlier, their curios@@ ity, their love of learning - begin to study what they love, follow their passion ...
Get@@ ting stimul@@ ated by their intelligence, follow paths of in@@ quir@@ y that they really want to.
After all, it was Eric and Kev@@ in, two years ago, just exactly these kinds of young men, who pro@@ mp@@ ted me and worked with me, and still do, in the study of in@@ deb@@ ted students in America.
Thank you for your attention.
Jam@@ ila Ra@@ q@@ ib@@ : The secret to effective nonviolent resistance.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We're not going to end violence by telling people that it's mor@@ ally wrong, says Jam@@ ila Ra@@ q@@ ib@@ , executive director of the Albert Einstein Institu@@ tion. Instead, we must find alternative ways to conduct conflict that are equally powerful and effective. Ra@@ q@@ i@@ b promo@@ tes nonviolent resistance to people living under ty@@ ran@@ ny - and there's a lot more to it than street protest@@ s. She shares encouraging examples of creative strategies that have led to change around the world and a message of hope for a future without armed conflict. "The greatest hope for humanity lies not in con@@ dem@@ ning violence but in making violence obsole@@ te@@ ," Ra@@ q@@ i@@ b say@@ s.
War has been a part of my life since I can remem@@ ber.
I was born in Afghanistan, just six months after the Sovi@@ ets invad@@ ed, and even though I was too young to understand what was happening, I had a deep sense of the suffering and the fear around me.
Those early experiences had a major impact on how I now think about war and conflict.
I learned that when people have a fundamental issue at st@@ ake, for most of them, giving in is not an option.
For these types conflicts - when people's rights are viol@@ ated, when their countries are occupi@@ ed, when they're op@@ pressed and humili@@ ated - they need a powerful way to resist and to fight back.
Which means that no matter how destructive and terrible violence is, if people see it as their only choice, they will use it.
Most of us are concerned with the level of violence in the world.
But we're not going to end war by telling people that violence is mor@@ ally wrong.
Instead, we must offer them a tool that's at least as powerful and as effective as violence.
This is the work I do.
For the past 13 years, I've been teaching people in some of the most difficult situations around the world how they can use nonviolent struggle to conduct conflict.
Most people associate this type of action with Gandhi and Martin Luther K@@ ing.
But people have been using nonviolent action for thousands of years.
In fact, most of the rights that we have today in this country - as women, as minor@@ ities, as workers, as people of different sexual orient@@ ations and citizens concerned with the environment - these rights weren't handed to us.
They were won by people who fought for them and who sacrific@@ ed for them.
But because we haven't learned from this history, nonviolent struggle as a technique is widely mis@@ understo@@ od.
I met recently with a group of Ethiop@@ ian activ@@ ists, and they told me something that I hear a lot.
They said they'd already tried nonviolent action, and it hadn't worked.
Y@@ ears ago they held a protest@@ .
The government arrested everyone, and that was the end of that.
The idea that nonviolent struggle is equivalent to street protests is a real problem.
Because although protests can be a great way to show that people want change, on their own, they don't actually create change - at least change that is fundamental.
Power@@ ful oppon@@ ents are not going to give people what they want just because they asked nic@@ ely ...
Or even not so nic@@ ely.
N@@ on@@ violent struggle works by destroying an oppon@@ ent, not physic@@ ally, but by identi@@ fying the institutions that an oppon@@ ent needs to survive, and then den@@ ying them those sources of power.
N@@ on@@ violent activists can neutr@@ alize the military by causing soldiers to defec@@ t.
They can disrup@@ t the economy through strikes and boy@@ cot@@ ts.
And they can challenge government propaganda by creating alternative media.
There are a variety of methods that can be used to do this.
My colleague and ment@@ or, Gene Shar@@ p, has identified 19@@ 8 methods of nonviolent action.
And protest is only one.
Let me give you a recent example.
Until a few months ago, Guatem@@ ala was ru@@ led by corrup@@ t former military officials with ties to organized crime.
People were generally aware of this, but most of them felt power@@ less to do anything about it - until one group of citizens, just 12 regular people, put out a call on Facebook to their friends to meet in the central pl@@ az@@ a, holding signs with a mess@@ age: "R@@ en@@ un@@ cia Y@@ A@@ " - res@@ ign already.
To their surprise, 30,000 people showed up.
They stayed there for months as protests spread throughout the country.
At one point, the organiz@@ ers delivered hundreds of eggs to various government buildings with a mess@@ age: "If you don't have the hu@@ ev@@ os" - the balls - "@@ to stop corrup@@ t candid@@ ates from running for office, you can borrow our@@ s."
President Mol@@ ina responded by vo@@ wing that he would never step down.
And the activists realized that they couldn't just keep protest@@ ing and ask the president to res@@ ig@@ n.
They needed to leave him no choice.
So they organized a general str@@ ike, in which people throughout the country refused to work.
In Guatem@@ ala City alone, over 400 businesses and schools shut their do@@ ors.
Meanwhile, farmers throughout the country bloc@@ ked major road@@ s.
Within five days, the presid@@ ent, along with dozens of other government offici@@ als, res@@ igned already.
I've been great@@ ly inspired by the creativity and br@@ aver@@ y of people using nonviolent action in nearly every country in the world.
For example, recently a group of activists in Uganda released a cr@@ ate of pig@@ s in the streets.
You can see here that the police are confused about what to do with them.
The pig@@ s were painted the color of the rul@@ ing party.
One pig was even wearing a h@@ at, a h@@ at that people recogn@@ iz@@ ed.
Ac@@ tiv@@ ists around the world are getting better at grab@@ bing head@@ lines, but these isolated actions do very little if they're not part of a larger strategy.
A general wouldn't march his troops into battle unless he had a plan to win the war.
Yet this is how most of the world's nonviolent movements oper@@ ate.
N@@ on@@ violent struggle is just as complex as military war@@ far@@ e, if not more.
Its participants must be well-@@ trained and have clear objec@@ tives, and its leaders must have a strategy of how to achieve those objec@@ tiv@@ es.
The technique of war has been developed over thousands of years with massive resources and some of our best minds dedicated to understanding and improving how it works.
Meanwhile, nonviolent struggle is rarely systematically studi@@ ed, and even though the number is grow@@ ing, there are still only a few dozen people in the world who are teaching it.
This is dangerous, because we now know that our old approaches of dealing with conflict are not adequ@@ ate for the new challenges that we're fac@@ ing.
The US government recently admit@@ ted that it's in a st@@ ale@@ mate in its war against IS@@ I@@ S.
But what most people don't know is that people have stood up to IS@@ I@@ S using nonviolent action.
When IS@@ I@@ S captured Mos@@ u@@ l in June 2014, they announced that they were putting in place a new public school curricul@@ um, based on their own extremis@@ t ide@@ ology.
But on the first day of school, not a single child showed up.
Par@@ ents simply refused to send them.
They told journalists they would rather ho@@ mes@@ cho@@ ol their children than to have them brain@@ was@@ h@@ ed.
This is an example of just one act of de@@ fi@@ ance in just one city.
But what if it was coordin@@ ated with the dozens of other acts of nonviolent resistance that have taken place against IS@@ IS@@ ?
What if the parent@@ s' boy@@ cot@@ t was part of a larger strategy to identify and cut off the resources that IS@@ I@@ S needs to function@@ ; the skilled labor needed to produce food@@ ; the engineers needed to extract and re@@ fine oil@@ ; the media infrastructure and communications networks and transportation systems, and the local businesses that IS@@ I@@ S reli@@ es on?
It may be difficult to imagine defe@@ ating IS@@ I@@ S with action that is non@@ viol@@ ent.
But it's time we challenge the way we think about conflict and the choices we have in facing it.
Here's an idea worth spread@@ ing: let's learn more about where nonviolent action has worked and how we can make it more powerful, just like we do with other systems and technologies that are constantly being refin@@ ed to better meet human needs.
It may be that we can improve nonviolent action to a point where it is increasingly used in place of war.
Viol@@ ence as a tool of conflict could then be abandoned in the same way that bo@@ ws and arro@@ ws were, because we have replaced them with weapons that are more effective.
With human innovation, we can make nonviolent struggle more powerful than the new@@ est and latest technologies of war.
The greatest hope for humanity lies not in con@@ dem@@ ning violence but in making violence obsole@@ te.
Thank you.
Tr@@ ist@@ an Harr@@ is: How better tech could protect us from distrac@@ tion.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How often does technology interrup@@ t us from what we really mean to be doing? At work and at play, we spend a start@@ ling amount of time distrac@@ ted by p@@ ings and pop@@ -@@ ups - instead of helping us spend our time well, it often feels like our tech is stealing it away from us. Design think@@ er Tr@@ ist@@ an Harr@@ is offers though@@ tful new ideas for technology that creates more meaningful interaction. He ask@@ s: "What does the future of technology look like when you're designing for the deepest human valu@@ es?"
What does it mean to spend our time well@@ ?
I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to spend my time.
Probably too much - I probably obs@@ ess over it.
My friends think I do.
But I feel like I kind of have to, because these days, it feels like little bits of my time kind of sli@@ p away from me, and when that happens, it feels like parts of my life are sli@@ pping away.
Speci@@ fic@@ ally, it feels like little bits of my time get sli@@ pped away to various things like this, like technology - I check things.
I'll give you an example.
If this email shows up - how many of you have gotten an email like this, right?
I've been tagged in a pho@@ to.
When this appear@@ s, I can't help but click on it right now.
Right? Because, like, what if it's a bad pho@@ to?
So I have to click it right now.
But I'm not just going to click "@@ See photo@@ ," what I'm actually going to do is spend the next 20 minutes.
But the worst part is that I know this is what's going to happen, and even knowing that's what's going to happen doesn't stop me from doing it again the next time.
Or I find myself in a situation like this, where I check my email and I pull down to refres@@ h, But the thing is that 60 seconds later, I'll pull down to refres@@ h again.
Why am I doing this?
This doesn't make any sense.
But I'll give you a hin@@ t why this is happening.
What do you think makes more money in the United States than movies, game parks and baseball combin@@ ed?
S@@ lot machines.
How can s@@ lot machines make all this money when we play with such small amounts of money@@ ?
We play with co@@ ins.
How is this possible?
Well, the thing is ...
My phone is a s@@ lot machine.
Every time I check my phone, I'm playing the s@@ lot machine to see, What am I going to get?
Every time I check my email, I'm playing the s@@ lot machine, saying, "What am I going to get@@ ?"
Every time I scr@@ oll a news fe@@ ed, I'm playing the s@@ lot machine to see, what am I going to get next?
And the thing is that, again, knowing exactly how this works - and I'm a designer, I know exactly how the psychology of this works, I know exactly what's going on - but it doesn't leave me with any choice, I still just get suc@@ ked into it.
So what are we going to do?
Because it leaves us with this all-@@ or-@@ nothing relationship with technology, right?
You're either on, and you're connected and distrac@@ ted all the time, or you're off, but then you're wondering, am I missing something important?
In other words, you're either distrac@@ ted or you have fear of missing out.
Right?
So we need to restore choice.
We want to have a relationship with technology that gives us back choice about how we spend time with it, and we're going to need help from designers, because knowing this stuff doesn't help.
We're going to need design help.
So what would that look like?
So let's take an example that we all fac@@ e: chat - text mess@@ aging.
So let's say there's two people.
N@@ anc@@ y's on the left and she's working on a document@@ , and John@@ 's on the right.
And John suddenly remember@@ s, "I need to ask Nancy for that document before I for@@ get@@ ."
So when he sends her that message, it blow@@ s away her attention.
That's what we're doing all the time, bull@@ doz@@ ing each other's attention, left and right.
And there's serious cost to this, because every time we interrup@@ t each other, it takes us about 23 minutes, on average, to re@@ focus our attention.
We actually cycle through two different projects before we come back to the original thing we were doing.
This is Gl@@ oria Mark@@ 's research combined with Microsoft research, that showed this.
And her research also shows that it actually trains bad habit@@ s.
The more interrup@@ tions we get extern@@ ally, it's condition@@ ing and training us to interrup@@ t ourselves.
We actually self-@@ interrup@@ t every three-@@ and-@@ a-half minutes.
This is crazy.
So how do we fix this?
Because Nancy and John are in this all-@@ or-@@ nothing relationship.
Nancy might want to dis@@ connec@@ t, but then she'd be worri@@ ed: What if I'm missing something important?
Design can fix this problem.
Let's say you have Nancy again on the left, John on the right.
And John remember@@ s, "I need to send Nancy that document@@ ."
Except this time, Nancy can mark that she's foc@@ used.
Let's say she drag@@ s a slid@@ er and says, "I want to be focused for 30 minut@@ es," so - b@@ am - she's foc@@ used.
Now when John wants to message her, he can get the thought off of his mind - because he has a need, he has this thought, and he needs to dum@@ p it out before he for@@ get@@ s.
Except this time, it holds the messages so that Nancy can still focus, but John can get the thought off of his mind.
But this only works if one last thing is true, which is that Nancy needs to know that if something is truly important, John can still interrup@@ t.
But instead of having constant accid@@ ental or mind@@ less interrup@@ tions, we're now only creating conscious interrup@@ tions, So we're doing two things here.
We're creating a new choice for both Nancy and John, But there's a second, subtle thing we're doing here, too.
And it's that we're changing the question we're answer@@ ing.
Instead of the goal of chat be@@ ing: "Let's design it so it's easy to send a mess@@ ag@@ e" - that's the goal of ch@@ at, it should be really easy to send a message to someone - we change the goal to something deeper and a human value, which is: "Let's create the highest possible quality communication in a relationship between two people.
So we up@@ grad@@ ed the goal.
Now, do designers actually care about this?
Do we want to have conversations about what these deeper human goals are?
Well, I'll tell you one story.
A little over a year ago, I got to help organize a meeting between some of technolog@@ y's leading designers and Th@@ ich N@@ h@@ at H@@ anh@@ .
Th@@ ich N@@ h@@ at Han@@ h is an international spok@@ esper@@ son for mind@@ fulness medit@@ ation.
And it was the most amazing meeting.
You have to imagine - picture a room - on one side of the room, you have a bunch of tech gee@@ k@@ s; on the other side of the room, you have a bunch of long brown rob@@ es, s@@ hav@@ ed heads, Buddhist mon@@ ks.
And the questions were about the deepest human values, like what does the future of technology look like when you're designing for the deepest questions and the deepest human valu@@ es?
And our conversation cent@@ ered on listening more deeply to what those values might be.
He jo@@ ked in our conversation that what if, instead of a spell chec@@ k, you had a compassion chec@@ k, meaning, you might highlight a word that might be accident@@ ally ab@@ ras@@ ive - perceived as ab@@ ras@@ ive by someone else.
So does this kind of conversation happen in the real world, not just in these design meet@@ ing@@ s?
Well, the answer is yes, and one of my favori@@ tes is Cou@@ ch@@ surf@@ ing.
If you didn't know, Cou@@ ch@@ surf@@ ing is a website that matches people who are looking for a place to stay with a free cou@@ ch, from someone who's trying to offer it.
So, great service - what would their design goal be?
What are you designing for if you work at Cou@@ ch@@ sur@@ fing@@ ?
Well, you would think it's to match gu@@ ests with hos@@ ts.
Right?
That's a pretty good goal.
But that would kind of be like our goal with mess@@ aging before, where we're just trying to deliver a message.
So what's the dee@@ per, human go@@ al?
Well, they set their goal as the need to create l@@ ast@@ ing, positive experiences and relationships between people who've never met before.
And the most amazing thing about this was in 2007, they introduced a way to measure this, which is incredible.
I'll tell you how it works.
For every design goal you have, you have to have a correspon@@ ding measure@@ ment to know how you're doing - a way of measuring success. So what they do is, let's say you take two people who meet up, and they take the number of days those two people spent together, and then they estimate how many hours were in those days - how many hours did those two people spend together@@ ?
And then after they spend that time together, they ask both of them@@ : How positive was your experi@@ ence?
Did you have a good experience with this person that you met@@ ?
And they sub@@ tract from those positive hours the amount of time people spent on the website, because that's a cost to people's lives.
Why should we value that as success@@ ?
And what you were left with is something they refer to as "@@ net orchestr@@ ated con@@ vivi@@ al@@ it@@ y," or, really, just a net "@@ Good Tim@@ es" created.
The net hours that would have never exis@@ ted, had Cou@@ ch@@ surf@@ ing not exis@@ ted.
Can you imagine how inspiring it would be to come to work every day and measure your success in the actual net new contribution of hours in people's lives that are positive, that would have never existed if you didn't do what you were about to do at work today?
Can you imagine a whole world that worked this way?
Can you imagine a social network that - let's say you care about cook@@ ing, and it measured its success in terms of cooking nights organized and the cooking articles that you were glad you read, and sub@@ trac@@ ted from that the articles you weren't glad you read or the time you spent scr@@ ol@@ ling that you didn't like?
Imagine a professional social network that, instead of measuring its success in terms of connections created or messages sent@@ , instead measured its success in terms of the job offers that people got that they were excited to get.
And sub@@ trac@@ ted the amount of time people spent on the website.
Or imagine dating services, like maybe T@@ ind@@ er or something, where instead of measuring the number of swi@@ pes left and right people did, which is how they measure success today, instead measured the deep, roman@@ tic, fulfilling connections people created.
Whatever that was for them, by the way.
But can you imagine a whole world that worked this way, that was helping you spend your time well@@ ?
Now to do this you also need a new system, because you're probably thinking, today's Internet economy - today's economy in general - is measured in time sp@@ ent.
The more users you have, the more usage you have, the more time people spen@@ d, that's how we measure success.
But we've solved this problem before.
We solved it with organ@@ ic, when we said we need to value things a different way.
We said this is a different kind of food.
So we can't compare it just based on pric@@ e; this is a different category of food.
We solved it with Le@@ ed Cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation, where we said this is a different kind of building that stood for different values of environmental sustain@@ ability.
What if we had something like that for technolog@@ y?
What if we had something whose entire purpose and goal was to help create net new positive contribu@@ tions to human life?
And what if we could value it a different way, so it would actually work?
Imagine you gave this different premi@@ um shelf space on app stor@@ es.
Imagine you had web brow@@ ser@@ s that helped route you to these kinds of design products.
Can you imagine how exciting it would be to live and create that world?
We can create this world today.
Comp@@ any leaders, all you have to do - only you can prioriti@@ ze a new metr@@ ic, which is your metric for net positive contribution to human life.
And have an honest conversation about that.
Maybe you're not doing so well to start with, but let's start that conversation.
Desig@@ ners, you can redefine success@@ ; you can redefine design.
Ar@@ gu@@ ably, you have more power than many people in your organization to create the choices that all of us live by.
Maybe like in medicine, where we have a Hi@@ pp@@ ocr@@ atic o@@ ath to recognize the responsibility and this higher value that we have to treat patients.
What if designers had something like that, in terms of this new kind of design@@ ?
And users, for all of us - we can demand technology that works this way.
Now it may seem hard, but McDonald's didn't have sal@@ ads until the consumer demand was there.
Wal@@ mart didn't have organic food until the consumer demand was there.
We have to demand this new kind of technology.
And we can do that.
And doing that would amount to shifting from a world that's driven and run entirely on time sp@@ ent, to world that's driven by time well sp@@ ent.
I want to live in this world, and I want this conversation to happen.
Let's start that conversation now.
Thank you.
Se@@ ema B@@ ans@@ al: How to fix a broken education system ... without any more money.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Se@@ ema B@@ ans@@ al for@@ ged a path to public education reform for 15,000 schools in Har@@ y@@ ana, India, by setting an ambitious go@@ al: by 2020, 80 percent of children should have grad@@ e-@@ level knowledge. She's looking to meet this goal by seeking re@@ forms that will work in every school without additional resources. B@@ ans@@ al and her team have found success using creative, straight@@ forward techniques such as communicating with teachers using SMS group ch@@ ats, and they have already measur@@ ably improved learning and engagement in Har@@ y@@ an@@ a's schools.
So we all have our own bi@@ as@@ es.
For example, some of us tend to think that it's very difficult to transform failing government systems.
When we think of government systems, we tend to think that they're arch@@ a@@ ic, set in their ways, and perhaps, the leadership is just too bureaucr@@ atic to be able to change things.
Well, today, I want to challenge that theory.
I want to tell you a story of a very large government system that has not only put itself on the path of reform but has also shown fairly spectacular results in less than three years.
This is what a classroom in a public school in India looks like.
There are 1 million such schools in India.
And even for me, who's lived in India all her life, walking into one of these schools is fairly heart@@ break@@ ing.
By the time kids are 11, 50 percent of them have fallen so far behind in their education that they have no hope to recover@@ .
11@@ -@@ year-olds cannot do simple addition, they cannot construct a gram@@ ma@@ tically correct sentence.
These are things that you and I would expect an 8@@ -year-old to be able to do.
By the time kids are 13 or 14, they tend to drop out of schools.
In India, public schools not only offer free education - they offer free text@@ books, free work@@ books, free me@@ als, sometimes even cash scholar@@ ships.
And yet, 40 percent of the parents today are choosing to pull their children out of public schools and pay out of their pockets to put them in private schools.
As a comparis@@ on, in a far richer country, the U@@ S, that number is only 10 percent.
That's a huge statement on how broken the Indian public education system is.
So it was with that background that I got a call in the summer of 201@@ 3 from an absolutely brilliant lady called Sur@@ ina Raj@@ an.
She was, at that time, the head of the Department of School Educa@@ tion in a state called Har@@ y@@ ana in India.
So she said to us, "Look, I've been heading this department for the last two years.
I've tried a number of things, and nothing seems to work.
Can you possibly help@@ ?"
Let me describe Har@@ y@@ ana a little bit to you.
Har@@ y@@ ana is a state which has 30 million people.
It has 15,000 public schools and 2 million plus children in those public schools.
So basically, with that phone call, I promised to help a state and system which was as large as that of Peru or Canada transform itself.
As I started this project, I was very pain@@ fully aware of two things.
One, that I had never done anything like this before.
And two, many others had, perhaps without too much success.
As my colleagues and I looked across the country and across the world, we couldn't find another example that we could just pick up and replicate in Har@@ y@@ ana.
We knew that we had to craft our own journey.
But anyway, we jumped right in and as we jumped in, all sorts of ideas started flying at us.
People said, "Let's change the way we recru@@ it teachers, let's hire new principal@@ s and train them and send them on international learning tour@@ s, let's put technology inside class@@ room@@ s."
By the end of week one, we had 50 ideas on the table, all amazing, all sounded right.
There was no way we were going to be able to implement 50 things.
So I said, "H@@ ang on, stop.
Let's first at least decide what is it we're trying to achie@@ ve."
So with a lot of push and pull and debate, Har@@ y@@ ana set itself a goal which sa@@ id: by 2020, we want 80 percent of our children to be at grad@@ e-@@ level knowledge.
Now the specific@@ s of the goal don't matter here, but what matters is how specific the goal is.
Because it really allowed us to take all those ideas which were being thrown at us and say which ones we were going to imple@@ ment.
Does this idea support this go@@ al? If yes, let's keep it.
But if it doesn't or we're not sure, then let's put it as@@ ide.
As simple as it sounds, having a very specific goal right up front has really allowed us to be very sharp and focused in our transformation journey.
And looking back over the last two and a half years, that has been a huge positive for us.
So we had the goal, and now we needed to figure out what are the issues, what is broken.
Before we went into schools, a lot of people told us that education quality is poor because either the teachers are laz@@ y, they don't come into schools, or they're in@@ cap@@ able, they actually don't know how to teach@@ .
Well, when we went inside schools, we found something completely different.
On most days, most teachers were actually inside schools.
And when you spoke with them, you realized they were perfectly capable of teaching elementary class@@ es.
But they were not teach@@ ing.
I went to a school where the teachers were getting the construction of a classroom and a toilet super@@ vis@@ ed.
I went to another school where two of the teachers had gone to a nearby bank branch to depos@@ it scholar@@ ship money into kid@@ s' accoun@@ ts.
At lunch@@ time, most teachers were spending all of their time getting the mid@@ day meal cook@@ ing, super@@ vis@@ ed and served to the students.
So we asked the teachers, "What's going on, why are you not teach@@ ing?"
And they said, "This is what's expected of us.
When a super@@ vis@@ or comes to visit us, these are exactly the things that he chec@@ ks.
Has the toilet been made, has the meal been ser@@ ved.
When my principal goes to a meeting at head@@ quar@@ ters, these are exactly the things which are discus@@ se@@ d."
You see, what had happened was, over the last two decades, India had been fighting the challenge of acc@@ ess, having enough schools, and enrol@@ l@@ ment, bringing children into the schools.
So the government launched a whole host of programs to address these challenges, and the teachers became the implic@@ it execut@@ ors of these programs.
Not explicit@@ ly, but implic@@ it@@ ly.
And now, what was actually needed was not to actually train teachers further or to monitor their attend@@ ance but to tell them that what is most important is for them to go back inside class@@ rooms and teach@@ .
They needed to be monitor@@ ed and measured and awar@@ ded on the quality of teaching and not on all sorts of other things.
So as we went through the education system, as we del@@ ved into it dee@@ per, we found a few such core root causes which were determin@@ ing, which were shaping how people behav@@ ed in the system.
And we realized that unless we change those specific things, we could do a number of other things.
We could train@@ , we could put technology into schools, but the system wouldn't change.
And addressing these non-@@ obvious core issues became a key part of the program.
So, we had the goal and we had the issues, and now we needed to figure out what the solutions were.
We obviously did not want to re@@ create the whe@@ el, so we said, "Let's look around and see what we can fin@@ d."
And we found these beautiful, small pilot experiments all over the country and all over the world.
S@@ mall things being done by NG@@ Os, being done by found@@ ations.
But what was also interesting was that none of them actually scal@@ ed.
All of them were limited to 50, 100 or 500 schools.
And here, we were looking for a solution for 15,000 schools.
So we looked into why, if these things actually work, why don't they actually scal@@ e?
What happens is that when a typical NG@@ O comes in, they not only bring in their expertise but they also bring in additional resources.
So they might bring in money, they might bring in people, they might bring in technology.
And in the 50 or 100 schools that they actually operate in, those additional resources actually create a difference.
But now imagine that the head of this NG@@ O goes to the head of the School Educa@@ tion Department and says, "Hey, now let's do this for 15,000 school@@ s."
Where is that guy or girl going to find the money to actually scale this up to 15,000 school@@ s?
He doesn't have the additional money, he doesn't have the resources.
And h@@ ence, innovations don't scale.
So right at the beginning of the project, what we said was, "Wh@@ ate@@ ver we have to do has to be scal@@ able, it has to work in all 15,000 school@@ s."
And h@@ ence, it has to work within the existing bud@@ gets and resources that the state actually has.
Mu@@ ch easier said than done.
I think this was definitely the point in time when my team hated me.
We spent a lot of long hours in office, in caf@@ és, sometimes even in bar@@ s, scrat@@ ching out heads and saying, "Where are the solutions, how are we going to solve this problem@@ ?"
In the end, I think we did find solutions to many of the issues.
I'll give you an example.
In the context of effective learning, one of the things people talk about is hand@@ s-@@ on learning.
Children shouldn't memor@@ ize things from books, they should do activi@@ ties, and that's a more effective way to learn.
Which basically means giving students things like be@@ ads, learning rod@@ s, ab@@ ac@@ uses.
But we did not have the bud@@ gets to give that to 15,000 schools, 2 million children.
We needed another solution.
We couldn't think of anything.
One day, one of our team members went to a school and saw a teacher pick up sticks and stones from the garden outside and take them into the classroom and give them to the students.
That was a huge e@@ ure@@ ka moment for us.
So what happens now in the text@@ books in Har@@ y@@ ana is that after every concept, we have a little box which are instructions for the teachers which say, "To teach this concept, here's an activity that you can do.
And by the way, in order to actually do this activity, here are things that you can use from your immediate environment, whether it be the garden outside or the classroom inside, which can be used as learning a@@ ids for kid@@ s."
And we see teachers all over Har@@ y@@ ana using lots of innovative things to be able to teach students.
So in this way, whatever we desig@@ ned, we were actually able to implement it across all 15,000 schools from day one.
Now, this brings me to my last point.
How do you implement something across 15,000 schools and 100,000 teacher@@ s?
The department used to have a process which is very interesting.
I like to call it "The Ch@@ ain of Hope@@ ."
They would write a letter from the head@@ quarters and send it to the next level, which was the district offic@@ es.
They would hope that in each of these district offic@@ es, an officer would get the let@@ ter, would open it, read it and then forward it to the next level, which was the block offic@@ es.
And then you would hope that at the block office, somebody else got the let@@ ter, opened it, read it and forwar@@ ded it eventually to the 15,000 principal@@ s.
And then one would hope that the principal@@ s got the let@@ ter, received it, understood it and started implement@@ ing it.
It was a little bit ridicul@@ ous.
Now, we knew technology was the answer, but we also knew that most of these schools don't have a computer or email.
However, what the teachers do have are smart@@ phones.
They're constantly on S@@ MS, on Facebook and on Wh@@ at@@ s@@ Ap@@ p.
So what now happens in Har@@ y@@ ana is, all principal@@ s and teachers are divided into hundreds of Wh@@ at@@ s@@ Ap@@ p groups and any@@ time something needs to be communic@@ ated, it's just posted across all Wh@@ at@@ s@@ Ap@@ p groups.
It spreads like wild@@ fire.
You can immediately check who has received it, who has read it.
Te@@ acher@@ s can ask clari@@ fication questions instantane@@ ously.
And what's interesting is, it's not just the head@@ quarters who are answering these questions.
Another teacher from a completely different part of the state will stand up and answer the question.
Every@@ body's acting as everybody's peer group, and things are getting imple@@ mente@@ d.
So today, when you go to a school in Har@@ y@@ ana, things look different.
The teachers are back inside class@@ rooms, they're teach@@ ing.
Of@@ ten with innovative techni@@ ques.
When a super@@ vis@@ or comes to visit the classroom, he or she not only chec@@ ks the construction of the toilet but also what is the quality of teach@@ ing.
Once a quar@@ ter, all students across the state are ass@@ essed on their learning outcomes and schools which are doing well are rewar@@ ded.
And schools which are not doing so well find themselves having difficult convers@@ ations.
Of course, they also get additional support to be able to do better in the future.
In the context of education, it's very difficult to see results quickly.
When people talk about system@@ ic, large-scale change, they talk about periods of 7 years and 10 years.
But not in Har@@ y@@ ana.
In the last one year, there have been three independent studies, all measuring student learning outcom@@ es, which indicate that something fundamental, something unique is happening in Har@@ y@@ ana.
L@@ earning levels of children have stopped declin@@ ing, and they have started going up.
Har@@ y@@ ana is one of the few states in the country which is showing an improv@@ ement, and certainly the one that is showing the fastest rate of improv@@ ement.
These are still early sign@@ s, there's a long way to go, but this gives us a lot of hope for the future.
I recently went to a school, and as I was leav@@ ing, I ran into a lad@@ y, her name was Par@@ v@@ ati@@ , she was the mother of a child, and she was smil@@ ing.
And I said, "Why are you smil@@ ing, what's going on@@ ?"
And she said, "I don't know what's going on, but what I do know is that my children are learning, they're having fun, and for the time being, I'll stop my search for a private school to send them to."
So I go back to where I star@@ te@@ d: Can government systems transform@@ ?
I certainly believe so.
I think if you give them the right lever@@ s, they can move mountain@@ s.
Thank you.
Chris Mil@@ k: The birth of virtual reality as an art form.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Chris Mil@@ k uses innovative technologies to make person@@ al, inter@@ active, human stories. Ac@@ companied by Joshua Roman on cell@@ o and Mc@@ Ken@@ z@@ ie S@@ tub@@ bert on piano, Mil@@ k traces his relationship to music and art - from the first moment he remem@@ bers putting on head@@ phones to his current work creating breakthrough virtual reality projects. V@@ R is the last medium for storytell@@ ing, he says, because it clos@@ es the gap between audience and story@@ tel@@ ler. To illustr@@ ate, he brought the TED audience together in the world's largest collective V@@ R experience. Jo@@ in them and take part in this interactive talk by getting a Google Car@@ d@@ board and down@@ lo@@ ading the experience at with@@ .@@ in@@ /@@ TED.
When I was a kid, I experienced something so powerful, I spent the rest of my life searching for it, and in all the wrong places.
What I experienced wasn't virtual reality.
It was music.
And this is where the story begin@@ s.
That's me, listening to the Beat@@ les@@ ' "@@ White Al@@ bum@@ ."
And the look on my face is the feeling that I've been searching for ever since.
Music goes straight to the emotional ve@@ in, into your blood@@ stream and right into your heart.
It dee@@ pen@@ s every experience.
F@@ ell@@ as?
This is the amazing Mc@@ Ken@@ z@@ ie S@@ tub@@ bert and Joshua Ro@@ man.
Music - Music makes everything have more emotional reson@@ ance.
Let's see how it does for this talk.
The right piece of music at the right time f@@ uses with us on a cellular level.
When I hear that one song from that one summer with that one girl, I'm instantly transported back there again.
Hey, St@@ ace@@ y.
Here's a part of the story, though, where I got a little gre@@ ed@@ y.
I thought if I added more layers on top of the music, I could make the feelings even more powerful.
So I got into direc@@ ting music videos.
This is what they looked like.
That's my brother, Jef@@ f.
Sor@@ ry about this, Jef@@ f.
Here's me, just so we're ev@@ en.
In@@ credi@@ ble mov@@ es.
S@@ hou@@ l@@ d@@ 've been a dan@@ cer.
These experiments gre@@ w, and in time, started to look more like this.
In bo@@ th, I'm searching for the same thing, though, to capture that lightning in a bott@@ le.
Ex@@ cep@@ t, I'm not.
Ad@@ ding moving pictures over the music added narrative dimen@@ sion, yes, but never quite equ@@ ated the power that just raw music had for me on its own.
This is not a great thing to realize when you've devoted your life and professional career to becoming a music video direc@@ tor.
I kept asking myself, did I take the wrong path@@ ?
So I started think@@ ing: if I could involve you, the audience, more, I might be able to make you feel something more as well.
So Aaron K@@ ob@@ lin and I began audi@@ tion@@ ing new technologies that could put more of you inside of the work, like your childhood home in "The Wil@@ der@@ ness Do@@ wn@@ town@@ ," your hand-@@ drawn portra@@ its, in "The Johnny C@@ ash Projec@@ t@@ ," and your interactive dreams in "@@ 3 Dre@@ ams of Black@@ ."
We were pushing beyond the screen, trying to connect more deeply to people's hearts and imagin@@ ations.
But it wasn't quite enough.
It still didn't have the raw experi@@ ential power of pure music for me.
So I started chasing a new technology that I only had read about in science fic@@ tion.
And after years of search@@ ing, I found a prototy@@ pe.
It was a project from N@@ on@@ ny de la Pe@@ ñ@@ a in Mark Bol@@ as@@ 's lab in US@@ C.
And when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.
I could taste the light@@ ning.
It was called virtual reality.
This was it five years ago when I ran into it.
This is what it looks like now.
I quickly started building things in this new medi@@ um, and through that process we realized some@@ thing: that V@@ R is going to play an incredibly important role in the history of medi@@ um@@ s.
In fact, it's going to be the last one.
I mean this because it's the first medium that actually makes the jump from our intern@@ alization of an author@@ 's expression of an experience, to our experiencing it fir@@ s@@ th@@ and.
You look confu@@ sed. I'll explain@@ . Don't worr@@ y.
If we go back to the origins of medi@@ um@@ s, by all best guess@@ es, it starts around a fire, with a good story.
Our cl@@ an leader is telling us about how he hun@@ ted the wo@@ ol@@ ly mammo@@ th on the t@@ und@@ ra that day.
We hear his words and translate them into our own internal truth@@ s.
The same thing happens when we look at the cave painting version of the story, the book about the mammo@@ th hun@@ t, the play, the radio broadcas@@ t, the television show or the movie.
All of these medi@@ ums require what we call "@@ suspen@@ sion of dis@@ belief@@ ," because there's a translation gap between the reality of the story and our consciousness interpre@@ ting the story into our reality.
I'm using the word "@@ conscious@@ ness@@ " as a feeling of reality that we get from our senses experiencing the world around us.
Virtual reality bridges that g@@ ap.
Now, you are on the t@@ und@@ ra hunting with the cl@@ an lead@@ er.
Or you are the cl@@ an lead@@ er.
Or maybe you're even the wo@@ ol@@ ly mammo@@ th.
So here's what special about V@@ R.
In all other medi@@ um@@ s, your consciousness interpre@@ ts the medium.
In V@@ R, your consciousness is the medium.
So the potential for V@@ R is enorm@@ ous.
But where are we now?
What is the current state of the ar@@ t?
Well, we are here.
We are the equivalent of year one of cine@@ ma.
This is the L@@ um@@ i@@ è@@ re Bro@@ thers film that al@@ leg@@ edly sent a theater full of people running for their lives as they thought a train was coming toward them.
Sim@@ il@@ ar to this early stage of this medi@@ um, in V@@ R, we also have to move past the spectac@@ le and into the storytell@@ ing.
It took this medium decades to figure out its prefer@@ red language of storytell@@ ing, in the form of a feature film.
In V@@ R today, we're more learning gram@@ mar than writing language.
We've made 15 films in the last year at our V@@ R company, V@@ r@@ se, and we've learned a few things.
We found that we have a uni@@ que, direct path into your sens@@ es, your emotions, even your body.
So let me show you some things.
For the purpose of this dem@@ o, we're going to take every direction that you could possibly look, and stretch it into this giant rectang@@ le.
OK, here we go.
So, first@@ : camera movement is tricky in V@@ R.
D@@ one wrong, it can actually make you sick.
We found if you move the camera at a constant speed in a straight line, you can actually get away with it, though.
The first day in film school, they told me you have to learn every single rule before you can break one.
We have not learned every single rule.
We've barely learned any at all, but we're already trying to break them to see what kind of creative things we can accompl@@ ish.
In this shot here, where we're moving up off the ground, I added acceler@@ ation.
I did that because I wanted to give you a physical sensation of moving up off the ground.
In V@@ R, I can give that to you.
Not surprisingly, music matters a lot in this medium as well.
It gu@@ ides us how to feel.
In this project we made with the New York Times, Z@@ ach Ric@@ h@@ ter and our friend, J@@ R, we take you up in a helicop@@ ter, and even though you're flying 2,000 feet above Manhattan, you don't feel afr@@ aid.
You feel trium@@ ph@@ ant for J@@ R@@ 's character.
The music gu@@ ides you there.
Contr@@ ary to popular belief@@ , there is composition in virtual reality, but it's completely different than in film, where you have a rectang@@ ular fr@@ ame.
Com@@ position is now where your consciousness exists and how the world moves around you.
In this film, "W@@ aves of Gr@@ ace@@ ," which was a collaboration between V@@ r@@ se, the United N@@ ations, Gab@@ o Ar@@ ora, and Im@@ ra@@ an Is@@ ma@@ il, we also see the changing role of the close-@@ up in virtual reality.
A close-@@ up in V@@ R means you're actually close up to some@@ one.
It brings that character inside of your personal space, a space that we'd usually reserve for the people that we love.
And you feel an emotional clos@@ eness to the character because of what you feel to be a physical clos@@ eness.
Direc@@ ting V@@ R is not like direc@@ ting for the rectang@@ le.
It's more of a choreo@@ graphy of the viewer@@ 's attention.
One tool we can use to guide your attention is called "@@ spati@@ alized sound@@ ."
I can put a sound anywhere in front of you, to left or right, even behind you, and when you turn your head, the sound will rotate ac@@ cor@@ d@@ ing@@ ly.
So I can use that to direct your attention to where I want you to see.
Next time you hear someone singing over your shoulder, it might be Bon@@ o.
V@@ R makes us feel like we are part of something.
For most of human history, we lived in small family un@@ its.
We started in cav@@ es, then moved to cl@@ ans and trib@@ es, then villages and town@@ s, and now we're all global citizens.
But I believe that we are still hard@@ wired to care the most about the things that are local to us.
And V@@ R makes anywhere and anyone feel local.
That's why it works as an empathy machine.
Our film "C@@ lou@@ ds Over Sid@@ ra@@ " takes you to a Sy@@ ri@@ an refugee cam@@ p, and instead of watching a story about people over there, it's now a story about us here.
But where do we go from here?
The tricky thing is that with all previous medi@@ um@@ s, the format is fixed at its birth.
Fil@@ m has been a sequence of rectang@@ les, from Mu@@ y@@ bridge and his hor@@ ses to now.
The format has never changed.
But V@@ R as a forma@@ t, as a medi@@ um, isn't complete yet.
It's not using physical cell@@ ul@@ o@@ id or paper or TV sign@@ als.
It actually emplo@@ ys what we use to make sense of the world.
We're using your senses as the pain@@ ts on the can@@ vas, but only two right now.
Eventu@@ ally, we can see if we will have all of our human senses employ@@ ed, and we will have agency to live the story in any path we choos@@ e.
And we call it virtual reality right now, but what happens when we move past simulated real@@ iti@@ es?
What do we call it then?
What if instead of verb@@ ally telling you about a dream, I could let you live inside that dream@@ ?
What if instead of just experiencing visiting some reality on Earth, you could sur@@ f gravitational waves on the edge of a black ho@@ le, or create galaxies from scrat@@ ch, or communicate with each other not using words but using our raw though@@ ts?
That's not a virtual reality anymore.
And honest@@ ly I don't know what that's cal@@ led.
But I hope you see where we're going.
But here I am, intellectu@@ alizing a medium I'm saying is experi@@ enti@@ al.
So let's experience it.
In your hands, you hopefully hold a piece of card@@ board.
Let's open the fl@@ ap.
T@@ ap on the power button to unlock the phone.
For the people watching at home, we're going to put up a card right now to show you how to download this experience on your phone yourself, and even get a Google cardboard of your own to try it with.
We played in cardboard boxes as kids, and as adults, I'm hoping we can all find a little bit of that lightning by sticking our head in one again. You're about to participate in the largest collective V@@ R viewing in history.
And in that classic old-@@ time@@ y style of yester@@ year, we're all going to watch something at the exact same time, together.
Let's hope it works.
What's the coun@@ t@@ down look like? I can't see.
Audience: ...@@ 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 Audience: J@@ R: Let me tell you how I shot the cover of the New York Times Magaz@@ ine, "@@ Wal@@ king New York@@ ."
I just got str@@ apped on outside the helicop@@ ter, and I had to be perfectly vertical so I could grab it.
And when I was perfectly above - you know, with the wind, we had to re@@ do it a few times - then I kept shoot@@ ing.
Wo@@ man's vo@@ ice: De@@ ar Lor@@ d, protect us from evil, for you are the Lor@@ d, the light.
You who gave us life took it away.
Let your will be done.
Please bring peace to the many who have lost loved ones.
Hel@@ p us to live again.
Chil@@ d's vo@@ ice: There are more kids in Z@@ a@@ at@@ ari than adults right now.
Sometimes I think we are the ones in charge.
Chris Mil@@ k: How was it?
That was a cheap way of getting you to do a standing ov@@ ation.
I just made you all stand@@ . I knew you'd applau@@ d at the end.
I believe that everyone on Earth needs to experience what you just experienc@@ ed.
That way we can collectively start to shape this, not as a tech platform but as a humanity plat@@ form.
And to that end, in November of last year, the New York Times and V@@ r@@ se made a V@@ R project called "The Dis@@ plac@@ ed."
It launched with one million Google Car@@ d@@ boards sent out to every Sunday sub@@ scri@@ ber with their news@@ paper.
But a funny thing happened that Sunday morning.
A lot of people got them that were not the intended recipi@@ ents on the ma@@ iling lab@@ el.
And we started seeing this all over In@@ st@@ agr@@ am.
Look famili@@ ar?
Music led me on a path of searching for what seemed like the un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for a very long time.
Now, millions of kids just had the same forma@@ tive experience in their childhood that I had in mine.
Only I think this one sur@@ passes it.
Let's see where this leads them.
Thank you.
Ke@@ ol@@ u Fo@@ x@@ : Why genetic research must be more diver@@ se.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Nin@@ et@@ y-@@ six percent of genome studies are based on people of European des@@ cent@@ . The rest of the world is virtually un@@ represented - and this is dangerous, says genetic@@ ist and TED Fellow Ke@@ ol@@ u Fo@@ x, because we react to drugs differently based on our genetic make@@ up. Fox is working to democr@@ ati@@ ze genome sequ@@ enc@@ ing, specifically by advoc@@ ating for indigenous populations to get involved in research, with the goal of elimin@@ ating health dispar@@ ities. "The research community needs to immer@@ se itself in indigenous cul@@ ture@@ ," he says, "@@ or die tr@@ y@@ ing."
As a little Hawai@@ i@@ an, my mom and aun@@ tie always told me stories about Kal@@ au@@ pap@@ a - the Hawai@@ ian le@@ per colony surrounded by the highest sea cliff@@ s in the world - and F@@ ather D@@ ami@@ en, the Bel@@ gian mission@@ ary who gave his life for the Hawai@@ ian community.
As a young nur@@ se, my aun@@ t trained the n@@ uns caring for the remaining le@@ pers almost a 100 years after F@@ ather D@@ ami@@ en died of le@@ pros@@ y.
I remember stories she told about traveling down swit@@ ch@@ back clif@@ f paths on a mu@@ le, while my uncle played her favorite h@@ ula songs on the u@@ k@@ ul@@ ele all the way down to Kal@@ au@@ pap@@ a.
You see, as a youn@@ g@@ ster, I was always curious about a few things.
First was why a Bel@@ gian mission@@ ary chose to live in complete isol@@ ation in Kal@@ au@@ pap@@ a, knowing he would inevitably contract le@@ pros@@ y from the community of people he s@@ ought to help.
And secon@@ dly, where did the le@@ pros@@ y bacteria come from?
And why were K@@ ā@@ nak@@ a Ma@@ ol@@ i, the indigenous people of Hawai@@ i, so sus@@ cep@@ tible to developing le@@ pros@@ y, or "@@ ma@@ i Pa@@ ke@@ ?"
This got my curious about what makes us unique as Hawai@@ ians - namely, our genetic make@@ up.
But it wasn't until high school, through the Human Geno@@ me Projec@@ t, that I realized I wasn't alone in trying to connect our unique genetic ancestr@@ y to our potential health, well@@ ness and illness.
You see, the 2.@@ 7 billi@@ on-@@ dollar project promised an era of predic@@ tive and prevent@@ ative medicine based on our unique genetic make@@ up.
So to me it always seemed obvious that in order to achieve this dream, we would need to sequence a diverse co@@ hor@@ t of people to ob@@ tain the full spectrum of human genetic variation on the planet.
That's why 10 years later, it continues to shock me, knowing that 96 percent of genome studies associ@@ ating common genetic variation with specific diseases have focused exclus@@ ively on individuals of European ancestr@@ y.
Now you don't need a Ph@@ D to see that that leaves four percent for the rest of diversity.
And in my own search@@ ing, I've discovered that far less than one percent have actually focused on indigenous communities, like myself.
So that beg@@ s the question: Who is the Human Geno@@ me Project actually for?
Just like we have different colored eyes and hair, we metabol@@ ize drugs differently based on the variation in our genom@@ es.
So how many of you would be shocked to learn that 95 percent of clinical trials have also exclus@@ ively feature@@ d individuals of European ancestr@@ y?
This bias and systematic lack of engagement of indigenous people in both clinical trials and genome studies is parti@@ ally the result of a history of distr@@ us@@ t.
For example, in 1989, researchers from Ari@@ zona State University obtain@@ ed blood samples from Arizon@@ a's Hav@@ as@@ u@@ pai tri@@ be, promising to al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate the burden of type 2 diabetes that was pl@@ agu@@ ing their community, only to turn around and use those exact same samples - without the Hav@@ as@@ u@@ pa@@ i@@ 's cons@@ ent - to study rates of schizophren@@ ia, in@@ bre@@ ed@@ ing, and challenge the Hav@@ as@@ u@@ pa@@ i@@ 's origin story.
When the Hav@@ as@@ u@@ pai found out, they su@@ ed successfully for $@@ 7@@ 00@@ ,000, and they ban@@ ned AS@@ U from conduc@@ ting research on their reserv@@ ation.
This cul@@ min@@ ated in a sort of domin@@ o effect with local tribes in the Sou@@ thwest - including the Nav@@ aj@@ o N@@ ation, one of the largest tribes in the country - putting a mor@@ atori@@ um on genetic research.
Now despite this history of distr@@ ust, I still believe that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research.
And if we don't do something soon, the gap in health dispar@@ ities is going to continue to wid@@ en.
Hawai@@ i, for example, has the longest life expectancy on average of any state in the U@@ S, yet native Hawai@@ ians like myself die a full decade before our non-@@ native counter@@ parts, because we have some of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes, obes@@ ity, and the number one and number two kill@@ ers in the U@@ S: cardiovascular disease and cancer.
So how do we ensure the populations of people that need genome sequencing the most are not the last to benef@@ it?
My vision is to make genetic research more n@@ ative, to indi@@ gen@@ ize genome sequencing technology.
Tr@@ adi@@ tion@@ ally, genomes are sequ@@ enced in labor@@ atori@@ es.
Here's an image of your classic genome sequ@@ en@@ cer.
It's hu@@ ge.
It's the size of a refriger@@ ator.
There's this obvious physical limit@@ ation.
But what if you could sequence genomes on the fl@@ y?
What if you could fit a genome sequ@@ enc@@ er in your pocket@@ ?
This nano@@ por@@ e-@@ based sequ@@ enc@@ er is one 10@@ ,000@@ th the size of your traditional genome sequ@@ en@@ cer.
It doesn't have the same physical limit@@ ations, in that it's not te@@ thered to a lab ben@@ ch with ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous cor@@ ds, large v@@ ats of chemicals or computer monitor@@ s.
It allows us to de-@@ black box genome sequencing technology development in a way that's immer@@ sive and collabor@@ ative, activ@@ ating and empowering indigenous communities ... as citizen scientists.
100 years later in Kal@@ au@@ pap@@ a, we now have the technology to sequence le@@ pros@@ y bacteria in real time, using mobile genome sequ@@ encer@@ s, remote access to the Internet and cloud comput@@ ation.
But only if that's what Hawai@@ ian people want.
In our space, on our terms.
Indi@@ Gen@@ om@@ ics is about science for the people by the people.
We'll be starting with a tribal consult@@ ation resourc@@ e, focused on educ@@ ating indigenous communities on the potential use and mis@@ use of genetic information.
E@@ vent@@ ually we'd like to have our own Indi@@ Gen@@ om@@ ics research institu@@ te to conduct our own experiments and educate the next generation of indigenous scientists.
In the end, indigenous people need to be partners in and not subjects of genetic research.
And for those on the outside, just as F@@ ather D@@ ami@@ en did, the research community needs to immer@@ se itself in indigenous culture or die tr@@ ying.
Ma@@ hal@@ o.
El@@ ise Ro@@ y: When we design for dis@@ ability, we all benef@@ it.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: "I believe that losing my hearing was one of the greatest gif@@ ts I've ever recei@@ ve@@ d@@ ," says El@@ ise Ro@@ y. As a disability rights lawyer and design think@@ er, she knows that being De@@ a@@ f gives her a unique way of experiencing and re@@ fr@@ aming the world - a perspective that could solve some of our largest problems. As she sa@@ ys: "When we design for disability first, you often stum@@ ble upon solutions that are better than those when we design for the norm@@ ."
Of laughing with my friends. I'll never forget the sound of my mother's voice right before I fell asle@@ ep.
And I'll never forget the comfor@@ ting sound of water trick@@ ling down a stream.
Imagine my fear, pure fear, when, at the age of 10, I was told I was going to lose my hear@@ ing.
And over the next five years, it progr@@ essed until I was classi@@ fied as profoundly deaf@@ .
But I believe that losing my hearing was one of the greatest gif@@ ts I've ever recei@@ ved.
You see, I get to experience the world in a unique way.
And I believe that these unique experiences that people with dis@@ abilities have is what's going to help us make and design a better world for everyone - both for people with and without dis@@ abilities.
I used to be a disability rights lawy@@ er, and I spent a lot of my time focused on enforc@@ ing the law, en@@ sur@@ ing that accommod@@ ations were made.
And then I had to quickly learn international policy, because I was asked to work on the U@@ N Con@@ v@@ ention that protec@@ ts people with dis@@ abilities.
As the leader of the NG@@ O there, I spent most of my energy trying to convince people about the capabilities of people with dis@@ abilities.
But somewhere along the way, and after many career transi@@ tions that my parents weren't so happy about - I st@@ umbled upon a solution that I believe may be an even more powerful tool to solve some of the world's greatest problems, disability or not.
And that tool is called design thinking.
Design thinking is a process for innovation and problem sol@@ ving.
There are five steps.
The first is defining the problem and understanding its constrain@@ ts.
The second is observing people in real-@@ life situations and empath@@ izing with them.
Thir@@ d, throwing out hundreds of ideas - the more the better, the wil@@ der the better.
Four@@ th, proto@@ typ@@ ing: gathering whatever you can, whatever you can find, to mimic your solution, to test it and to re@@ fine it.
And finally, implement@@ ation: en@@ sur@@ ing that the solution you came up with is sustainable.
Warren B@@ erg@@ er says that design thinking teaches us to look side@@ ways, to re@@ fr@@ ame, to refin@@ e, to experiment and, probably most importantly, ask those stupid questions.
Design think@@ ers believe that everyone is creative.
They believe in bringing people from multiple discipl@@ ines together, because they want to share multiple perspec@@ tives and bring them together and ultimately mer@@ ge them to form something new.
Design thinking is such a successful and vers@@ ati@@ le tool that it has been applied in almost every industry.
I saw the potential that it had for the issues I fac@@ ed, so I decided to go back to school and get my mas@@ ter's in social design.
This looks at how to use design to create positive change in the world.
While I was there, I fell in love with wood@@ working. But what I quickly realized was that I was missing out on something.
As you're working with a tool, right before it's about to kick back at you - which means the piece or the tool jum@@ ps back at you - it makes a sound.
And I couldn't hear this sound.
So I decided, why not try and solve it?
My solution was a pair of safety glasses that were engineered to visually al@@ ert the user to pitch changes in the tool, before the human ear could pick it up.
Why hadn't tool designers thought of this befor@@ e?
Two reason@@ s: one, I was a begin@@ ner.
I wasn't weigh@@ ed down by expertise or conventional wisdom.
The second is: I was De@@ af@@ .
My unique experience of the world helped inform my solution.
And as I went on, I kept running into more and more solutions that were originally made for people with dis@@ abil@@ ities, and that ended up being picked up, embrac@@ ed and loved by the mainstre@@ am, disability or not.
This is an O@@ X@@ O po@@ tato pe@@ el@@ er.
It was originally designed for people with ar@@ thri@@ tis, but it was so comfort@@ able, everybody loved it.
Tex@@ t mess@@ ag@@ ing: that was originally designed for people who are De@@ af@@ .
And as you know, everybody loves that, too.
I started think@@ ing: What if we changed our mind@@ se@@ t?
What if we started designing for disability first - not the norm@@ ?
As you see, when we design for disability first, we often stum@@ ble upon solutions that are not only inclus@@ ive, but also are often better than when we design for the nor@@ m.
And this exci@@ tes me, because this means that the energy it takes to accommod@@ ate someone with a disability can be lever@@ ag@@ ed, mol@@ ded and played with as a force for creativity and innovation.
This moves us from the mindset of trying to change the hearts and the defici@@ ency mindset of toler@@ ance, to becoming an al@@ chem@@ ist, the type of magici@@ an that this world so desperately needs to solve some of its greatest problems.
Now, I also believe that people with dis@@ abilities have great potential to be designers within this design@@ -@@ thinking process.
Without knowing it, from a very early age, I've been a design think@@ er, fin@@ e-@@ tun@@ ing my skills.
Design think@@ ers are, by nature, problem sol@@ vers.
So imagine listening to a conversation and only understanding 50 percent of what is said.
You can't ask them to repeat every single word.
They would just get frustrated with you.
So without even realizing it, my solution was to take the mu@@ ff@@ led sound I heard, that was the be@@ at, and turn it into a rhythm and place it with the li@@ ps I read.
Y@@ ears later, someone comm@@ ented that my writing had a rhythm to it.
Well, this is because I experience conversations as rhyth@@ ms.
I also became really, really good at fail@@ ing.
Quite liter@@ ally.
My first se@@ mes@@ ter in Span@@ ish, I got a D.
But what I learned was that when I picked myself up and changed a few things around, eventually, I succee@@ ded.
Similarly, design thinking encour@@ ages people to fail and fail often, because eventually, you will succe@@ ed.
Very few great innovations in this world have come from someone succe@@ eding on the first try.
I also experienced this lesson in sport@@ s.
I'll never forget my co@@ ach saying to my mom, "If she just didn't have her hearing loss, she would be on the national team@@ ."
But what my co@@ ach, and what I didn't even know at the time, was that my hearing loss actually helped me exce@@ l at sport@@ s.
You see, when you lose your hear@@ ing, not only do you adapt your behavior, but you also adapt your physical senses.
One example of this is that my visual attention span increas@@ ed.
Imagine a soccer play@@ er, coming down the left fl@@ an@@ k.
Imagine being go@@ al@@ kee@@ per, like I was, and the ball is coming down the left fl@@ an@@ k.
A person with normal hearing would have the visual perspective of this.
I had the benefit of a spectrum this wid@@ e.
So I picked up the players over here, that were moving about and coming down the field.
And I picked them up quick@@ er, so that if the ball was passe@@ d, I could re@@ position myself and be ready for that shot.
So as you can see, I've been a design think@@ er for nearly all my life.
My observation skills have been hon@@ ed so that I pick up on things that others would never pick up on.
My constant need to adapt has made me a great ide@@ ator and problem sol@@ ver.
And I've often had to do this within limitations and constrain@@ ts.
This is something that designers also have to deal with frequ@@ ently.
My work most recently took me to Haiti.
Design think@@ ers often seek out extreme situ@@ ations, because that often in@@ forms some of their best designs.
And Haiti - it was like a perfect stor@@ m.
I lived and worked with 300 De@@ a@@ f individuals that were rel@@ oc@@ ated after the 2010 earthqu@@ ake.
But five and a half years later, there still was no electric@@ ity; there still was no safe drinking water@@ ; there were still no job opportuni@@ ti@@ es; there was still ramp@@ ant crime, and it went un@@ pun@@ ished.
International aid organizations came one by one.
But they came with pre-@@ determined solutions.
They didn't come ready to observe and to adapt based on the commun@@ it@@ y's needs.
One organization gave them go@@ ats and chick@@ ens.
But they didn't realize that there was so much hunger in that community, that when the De@@ a@@ f went to sleep at night and couldn't hear, people broke into their yar@@ ds and their homes and st@@ ole these chick@@ ens and go@@ ats, and eventually they were all gone.
Now, if that organization had taken the time to observe De@@ a@@ f people, to observe the community, they would have realized their problem and perhaps they would have come up with a solution, something like a solar light, lighting up a secure pen to put them in at night to ensure their saf@@ ety.
You don't have to be a design think@@ er to inser@@ t the ideas I've shared with you today.
You are creative.
You are a designer - everyone is.
Let people like me help you.
Let people with dis@@ abilities help you look side@@ ways, and in the process, solve some of the greatest problems.
That's it. Thank you.
Brian L@@ it@@ t@@ le: Who are you, real@@ ly? The puzzle of personality.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What makes you, you? Psy@@ ch@@ ologists like to talk about our tra@@ its, or defined characteristics that make us who we are. But Brian Little is more interested in moments when we transcend those traits - sometimes because our culture demands it of us, and sometimes because we demand it of ourselves. Jo@@ in Little as he dissec@@ ts the surprising differences between intr@@ over@@ ts and extr@@ over@@ ts and explains why your personality may be more mal@@ le@@ able than you think.
What an intriguing group of individuals you are ...
To a psycholog@@ ist.
I've had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other.
And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, dis@@ playing psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today.
And I thought you might like to know who you are.
But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratu@@ it@@ ous and intr@@ us@@ ive, I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories, in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself.
I'm in the field of research known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger personality science which sp@@ ans the full spectr@@ um, from neurons to narr@@ atives.
And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us - each of you - is, in certain respec@@ ts, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person.
Now, already you may be saying of yourself, "I'm not intrigu@@ ing.
I am the 4@@ 6@@ th most boring person in the Western H@@ emis@@ pher@@ e."
Or you may say of yourself, "I am intrigu@@ ing, even if I am regar@@ ded by most people as a great, th@@ under@@ ing twit@@ ."
But it is your self-@@ diagnosed bor@@ ingness and your inherent "@@ twit@@ in@@ ess@@ " that makes me, as a psycholog@@ ist, really fascinated by you.
So let me explain why this is so.
One of the most influ@@ ential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it al@@ ig@@ ns you along five dimensions which are normally distribu@@ ted, and that describe univers@@ ally held aspects of difference between people.
They spell out the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m O@@ CE@@ A@@ N.
So, "O@@ " stands for "@@ open to experi@@ ence@@ ," versus those who are more clos@@ ed.
"C@@ " stands for "@@ conscienti@@ ous@@ ness@@ ," in contrast to those with a more l@@ ack@@ ad@@ ais@@ ical approach to life.
"E@@ " - "@@ extr@@ over@@ sion@@ ," in contrast to more intr@@ over@@ ted people.
"A@@ " - "@@ agre@@ e@@ able individual@@ s," in contrast to those decid@@ edly not agre@@ e@@ able.
And "N@@ " - "@@ neur@@ otic individual@@ s," in contrast to those who are more st@@ able.
All of these dimensions have implications for our well-@@ being, for how our life goes.
And so we know that, for example, openness and conscienti@@ ous@@ ness are very good predic@@ tors of life success, but the open people achieve that success through being audaci@@ ous and, occasion@@ ally, od@@ d.
The conscienti@@ ous people achieve it through sticking to dead@@ lines, to persever@@ ing, as well as having some passion.
Ex@@ tr@@ over@@ sion and agre@@ e@@ ab@@ len@@ ess are both condu@@ ci@@ ve to working well with people.
Ex@@ tr@@ over@@ ts, for example, I find intrigu@@ ing.
With my class@@ es, I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be reve@@ aling with respect to their person@@ al@@ ity: I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lic@@ k the outside of their own el@@ bo@@ w.
Did you know that?
Al@@ ready, some of you have tried to lic@@ k the outside of your own el@@ bo@@ w.
But extr@@ over@@ ts amongst you are probably those who have not only tri@@ ed, but they have successfully lic@@ ked the el@@ bow of the person sitting next to them.
Those are the extr@@ over@@ ts.
Let me deal in a bit more detail with extr@@ over@@ sion, because it's consequ@@ ential and it's intrigu@@ ing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natur@@ es.
First, our bi@@ ogen@@ ic nature - our neur@@ op@@ hy@@ si@@ ology.
Second, our soci@@ ogen@@ ic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives.
And third, what makes you individ@@ ually you - idi@@ os@@ yn@@ cr@@ atic - what I call your "@@ idi@@ ogen@@ ic@@ " nature.
Let me explain@@ .
One of the things that character@@ izes extr@@ over@@ ts is they need stimul@@ ation.
And that stimul@@ ation can be achieved by finding things that are excit@@ ing: loud nois@@ es, parties and social events here at TED - you see the extr@@ over@@ ts forming a magnetic co@@ re.
They all gather together.
And I've seen you.
The intr@@ over@@ ts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimul@@ ation - and may be mis@@ constru@@ ed as being anti@@ social, but you're not necessarily anti@@ social.
It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimul@@ ation.
Sometimes it's an internal stimul@@ ant, from your body.
C@@ af@@ fe@@ ine, for example, works much better with extr@@ over@@ ts than it does intr@@ over@@ ts.
When extr@@ over@@ ts come into the office at nine o'clock in the morning and say, "I really need a cup of coffe@@ e," they're not kid@@ ding - they really do.
In@@ tr@@ over@@ ts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in - and they've had some coffee - if those tasks are spee@@ ded, and if they're quantit@@ ative, intr@@ over@@ ts may give the appear@@ ance of not being particularly quantit@@ ative.
But it's a mis@@ constru@@ al.
So here are the consequences that are really quite intrigu@@ ing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point.
I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual inter@@ course, although I may not have time.
And so, if you would like me to - yes, you woul@@ d? OK.
There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the con@@ jug@@ al act, as broken down by mal@@ e, fem@@ ale@@ ; intr@@ over@@ t, extr@@ over@@ t.
So I ask you: How many times per minute - oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study - How many times per month do intr@@ over@@ ted men engage in the ac@@ t?
3.@@ 0.
Ex@@ tr@@ over@@ ted men@@ ? More or less@@ ?
Yes, more.
5.@@ 5 - almost twice as much.
In@@ tr@@ over@@ ted women@@ : 3.@@ 1.
Ex@@ tr@@ over@@ ted women@@ ?
Frank@@ ly, speaking as an intr@@ over@@ ted mal@@ e, which I will explain later - they are hero@@ ic.
7.@@ 5.
They not only handle all the male extr@@ over@@ ts, they pick up a few intr@@ over@@ ts as well.
We communicate differently, extr@@ over@@ ts and intr@@ over@@ ts.
Ex@@ tr@@ over@@ ts, when they interac@@ t, want to have lots of social encounter pun@@ ctu@@ ated by clos@@ eness.
They'd like to stand close for comfortable communication.
They like to have a lot of eye contac@@ t, or mu@@ tual gaz@@ e.
We found in some research that they use more diminu@@ tive terms when they meet some@@ body.
So when an extr@@ over@@ t meets a Char@@ les, it rapidly becomes "@@ Char@@ li@@ e," and then "@@ Ch@@ uck@@ ," and then "@@ Ch@@ uck@@ les Bab@@ y."
Whereas for intr@@ over@@ ts, it remains "@@ Char@@ les@@ ," until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to.
We speak differently.
Ex@@ tr@@ over@@ ts prefer black@@ -and-@@ white, concre@@ te, simple language.
In@@ tr@@ over@@ ts prefer - and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an intr@@ over@@ t as you could possibly imagine - we speak differently.
We prefer contextu@@ ally complex, conting@@ ent, we@@ as@@ el@@ -@@ word sentences - More or less.
As it were.
Not to put too fine a point upon it - like that.
When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other.
I had a consul@@ ting contract I shared with a colleague who's as different from me as two people can possibly be.
First, his name is T@@ om.
M@@ ine isn't.
Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be.
And thir@@ dly, he's as extr@@ over@@ ted a person as you could find.
I am seriously intr@@ over@@ ted.
I over@@ load so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the even@@ ing.
We had secon@@ ded to this project a fellow called Micha@@ el.
And Michael almost brought the project to a crash@@ ing hal@@ t.
So the person who secon@@ ded him asked Tom and me, "What do you make of Micha@@ el@@ ?" Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute.
He spoke in classic "@@ extr@@ over@@ t-@@ es@@ e."
And here is how extr@@ over@@ ted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accur@@ ate.
I said, "Well Michael does have a tendency at times of be@@ having in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more asser@@ tive than is normally called for@@ ."
Tom rolled his eyes and he said, "@@ Bri@@ an, that's what I sa@@ id: he's an ass@@ ho@@ le@@ !"
Now, as an intr@@ over@@ t, I might g@@ ently al@@ lu@@ de to certain "@@ as@@ sh@@ ol@@ ic@@ " qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lun@@ ge for the a-@@ word.
But the extr@@ over@@ t says, "If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one."
And we go past each other.
Now is this something that we should be he@@ ed@@ ful of@@ ?
Of course. It's important that we know this.
Is that all we are?
Are we just a bunch of tra@@ it@@ s?
No, we're not.
Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person.
How about that idi@@ os@@ yn@@ cr@@ atic you?
As Elizabeth or as Georg@@ e, you may share your extr@@ over@@ sion or your neuro@@ tic@@ ism.
But are there some distinc@@ tively Elizab@@ e@@ than features of your behavior, or Geor@@ gian of your@@ s, that make us understand you better than just a bunch of tra@@ it@@ s?
That make us love you?
Not just because you're a certain type of person.
I'm uncomfortable putting people in pige@@ on@@ hol@@ es.
I don't even think pige@@ ons belong in pige@@ on@@ hol@@ es.
So what is it that makes us different@@ ?
It's the do@@ ings that we have in our life - the personal projects.
You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here.
It relates to your kid - you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong.
Or it could be your mo@@ m.
And you'd been acting out of character.
These are free tra@@ its.
You're very agre@@ e@@ able, but you act disagre@@ e@@ ably in order to break down those barriers of administr@@ ative tor@@ por in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child.
What are these free tra@@ it@@ s?
They're where we en@@ act a script in order to advance a core project in our lives.
And they are what matters.
Don't ask people what type you are@@ ; ask them, "What are your core projects in your life@@ ?"
And we en@@ act those free tra@@ its.
I'm an intr@@ over@@ t, but I have a core project, which is to prof@@ ess.
I'm a professor.
And I ador@@ e my students, and I ador@@ e my field.
And I can't wait to tell them about what's new, what's excit@@ ing, what I can't wait to tell them about.
And so I act in an extr@@ over@@ ted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in ar@@ du@@ ous days of study.
But we need to be very careful when we act pro@@ trac@@ tedly out of character.
Sometimes we may find that we don't take care of ourselves.
I find, for example, after a period of pse@@ u@@ do-@@ extr@@ over@@ ted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own.
As Susan C@@ ain said in her "@@ Qu@@ i@@ et@@ " book, in a chapter that feature@@ d the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the sl@@ ings and arro@@ ws of outr@@ ageous extr@@ over@@ ts.
I remember one particular day when I was reti@@ red to a cub@@ ic@@ le, trying to avoid over@@ stimul@@ ation.
And a real extr@@ over@@ t came in beside me - not right in my cub@@ ic@@ le, but in the next cub@@ ic@@ le over - and I could hear various evacu@@ atory nois@@ es, which we hate - even our own, that's why we fl@@ ush during as well as after.
And then I heard this gr@@ avel@@ ly voice saying, "Hey, is that Dr. L@@ it@@ t@@ le@@ ?"
If anything is guarante@@ ed to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ate an intr@@ over@@ t for six months, it's talking on the jo@@ h@@ n.
That's where I'm going now.
Don't follow me.
Thank you.
Tom H@@ ul@@ me: What can we learn from short@@ cut@@ s?
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How do you build a product people really want@@ ? Al@@ low consumers to be a part of the process. "E@@ m@@ path@@ y for what your customers want is probably the biggest leading indic@@ ator of business success@@ ," says designer Tom H@@ ul@@ me. In this short talk, H@@ ul@@ me lays out three ins@@ ight@@ ful examples of the intersection of design and user experience, where people have developed their own desire paths out of necess@@ ity. Once you know how to spot them, you'll start notic@@ ing them everywhere.
When we're designing new products, services or businesses, the only time you'll know if they're any good, if the designs are good, is to see how they're used in the real world, in context.
I'm reminded of that every time I walk past High@@ bury Fi@@ el@@ ds in north London.
It's absolutely beautiful.
There's a big open green space.
There's Geor@@ gian buildings around the side.
But then there's this mud tra@@ p that cuts across the middle.
People clearly don't want to walk all the way around the edge.
Instead, they want to take the short@@ cut, and that short@@ cut is self-@@ rein@@ forc@@ ing.
Now, this short@@ cut is called a desire path, and it's often the path of least resistance.
I find them fascin@@ ating, because they're often the point where design and user experience diver@@ ge.
Now at this point, I should apolog@@ ize, because you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere.
But today, I'm going to pick three I find interesting and share what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services.
The first is in the capital city of Brazil - Bras@@ il@@ ia.
And it reminds me that sometimes, you have to just focus on designing for a real need at low fric@@ tion.
Now, Bras@@ il@@ ia is fascinating.
It was designed by Ni@@ e@@ me@@ y@@ er in the '50@@ s.
It was the golden age of fl@@ ying, so he laid it out like a plane, as you can see there.
S@@ ligh@@ tly worr@@ y@@ ingly, he put most of the important government buildings in the cock@@ p@@ it.
But if you zoom in, in the very center of Bras@@ il@@ ia, just where the point is there, you see it's lit@@ tered with desire path@@ s.
They're absolutely everywhere.
Now, they thought that they had future@@ -@@ pro@@ of@@ ed this design.
They thought in the future we wouldn't need to walk anywhere - we'd be able to drive - so there was little need for walk@@ ways or pav@@ em@@ ents.
But as you can see, there's a real need.
These are very dangerous desire path@@ s.
If we just pick one, in the middle, you can see it cross@@ es 15 lan@@ es of traffic@@ .
It won't surprise you guys that Bras@@ il@@ ia has five times the pedestri@@ an accident rate of your average US city.
People are res@@ ource@@ ful.
They'll always find the low-@@ fric@@ tion route to save money, save time.
Not all these desire paths are dangerous, I was reminded flying here when I was in He@@ a@@ thro@@ w.
Many of us get frustrated when we're confronted with the oblig@@ atory walk through dut@@ y-@@ free.
It was amazing to me how many people refused to take the long, me@@ and@@ ering path to the left, and just cut through to the right, cut through the desire path.
The question that's interesting is: What do designers think when they see our behavior here?
Do they think we're stupid@@ ?
Do they think we're laz@@ y?
Or do they accept that this is the only tru@@ th?
This is their product.
We're effectively co-@@ designing their product.
So our job is to design for real needs at low fric@@ tion, because if you don't, the customer will, anyway.
The second desire path I wanted to share is at the University of California.
And it reminds me that sometimes the best way to come up with a great design is just to launch it.
Now, university camp@@ uses are fantastic for spot@@ ting desire path@@ s.
I think it's because students are always late and they're pretty smart.
So they're d@@ ashing to lec@@ tures. They'll always find the short@@ cut@@ .
And the designers here knew that.
So they built the buildings and then they waited a few months for the paths to form.
They then pav@@ ed them.
In@@ credi@@ bly smart approach.
In fact, often, just launching the stra@@ w man of a service can teach you what people really want.
For example, Ay@@ r Mu@@ ir in Boston knew he wanted to open a restaur@@ ant.
But where should it be?
What should the menu be?
He launched a service, in this case a food truc@@ k, and he changed the location each day.
He'd write a different menu on the side in a whi@@ te@@ board marker to figure out what people wanted.
He now has a chain of restaur@@ ants.
So it can be incredibly efficient to launch something to spot the desire path@@ s.
The third and final desire path I wanted to share with you is the UNI@@ H.
It reminds me that the world's in flu@@ x, and we have to respond to those changes.
So as you'll guess, this is a hospital.
I've marked for you on the left the On@@ colog@@ y De@@ part@@ ment.
The patients would usually stay in the hotel@@ s down on the bottom right.
This was a patient@@ -@@ cent@@ ered organization, so they laid on cars for their patients.
But what they realized when they started offering chemotherap@@ y is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars.
They were too nau@@ se@@ ous, so they'd walk back to their hotel@@ s.
This desire path that you see diag@@ on@@ ally, forme@@ d.
The patients even called it "The Ch@@ em@@ o T@@ rail@@ ."
Now, when the hospital saw this origin@@ ally, they tried to lay tur@@ f back over it, ignore it.
But after a while, they realized it was an important need they were meeting for their patients, so they pav@@ ed it.
And I think our job is often to p@@ ave these emerging desire path@@ s.
If we look back at the one in North London again, that desire path hasn't always been there.
The reason it spr@@ ung up is people were traveling to the m@@ ighty Ar@@ sen@@ al Fo@@ ot@@ ball Clu@@ b stadi@@ um on game days, from the Under@@ ground station you see on the bottom right.
So you see the desire path.
If we just wind the clock back a few years, when the stadi@@ um was being construc@@ ted, there is no desire path.
So our job is to watch for these desire paths emerg@@ ing, and, where appropri@@ ate, p@@ ave them, as someone did here.
Someone installed a barri@@ er, people started walking across and round the bottom as you see, and they pav@@ ed it.
But I think this is a wonderful remin@@ der as well, that, actually, the world is in flu@@ x. It's constantly changing, because if you look at the top of this image, there's another desire path form@@ ing.
So these three desire paths remind me we need to design for real human needs.
I think empathy for what your customers want is probably the biggest leading indic@@ ator of business success.
Design for real needs and design them in low fric@@ tion, because if you don't offer them in low fric@@ tion, someone else will, often the custo@@ mer.
Secondly, often the best way to learn what people really want is to launch your service.
The answer is rarely inside the building.
Get out there and see what people really want.
And finally, in part because of technology, the world is incredibly flu@@ x at the moment.
It's changing const@@ ant@@ ly.
These desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever.
Our job is to pick the appropriate ones and p@@ ave over them.
Thank you very much.
W@@ anda Di@@ az Mer@@ ced@@ : How a blind astronom@@ er found a way to hear the stars.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: W@@ anda Di@@ az Mer@@ c@@ ed studies the light emit@@ ted by gam@@ ma@@ -@@ ray burst@@ s, the most energe@@ tic events in the universe. When she lost her sight and was left without a way to do her science, she had a revel@@ atory ins@@ igh@@ t: the light curves she could no longer see could be translated into sound. Through son@@ ific@@ ation, she reg@@ ained mas@@ tery over her work, and now she's advoc@@ ating for a more inclusive scientific community. "S@@ ci@@ ence is for every@@ one@@ ," she say@@ s. "It has to be available to everyone, because we are all natural explor@@ er@@ s."
Once there was a star.
Like everything else, she was bor@@ n@@ ; grew to be around 30 times the mass of our sun and lived for a very long time.
Ex@@ ac@@ tly how long, people cannot really tel@@ l.
Just like everything in life, she reached the end of her regular star days when her heart, the core of her life, exhaus@@ ted its fuel.
But that was no end.
She transformed into a super@@ nova, and in the process releasing a tremendous amount of energy, out@@ shining the rest of the galaxy and emit@@ ting, in one second, the same amount of energy our sun will release in 10 days.
And she evolved into another role in our galaxy.
Super@@ nova explos@@ ions are very extre@@ me.
But the ones that em@@ it gam@@ ma rays are even more extre@@ me.
In the process of becoming a super@@ nova, the interior of the star collap@@ ses under its own weight and it starts rot@@ ating ever faster, like an ice sk@@ ater when pulling their arms in close to their body.
In that way, it starts rot@@ ating very fast and it increas@@ es, power@@ fully, its magnetic field.
The matter around the star is dragged around, and some energy from that rot@@ ation is transferred to that matter and the magnetic field is increased even further.
In that way, our star had extra energy to out@@ shine the rest of the galaxy in brigh@@ t@@ ness and gam@@ ma ray emis@@ sion.
My star, the one in my story, became what is known as a mag@@ net@@ ar.
And just for your information, the magnetic field of a magne@@ tar is 1,000 trillion times the magnetic field of Earth.
The most energe@@ tic events ever measured by astronom@@ ers carry the name gam@@ ma@@ -@@ ray burst@@ s because we observe them as burst@@ s most or explos@@ ions, most strongly measured as gam@@ ma@@ -@@ ray light.
Our star, like the one in our story that became a mag@@ net@@ ar, is detec@@ ted as a gam@@ ma@@ -@@ ray burst during the most energe@@ tic portion of the explos@@ ion.
Yet, even though gam@@ ma@@ -@@ ray burst@@ s are the strong@@ est events ever measured by astronom@@ ers, we cannot see them with our naked eye.
We depen@@ d, we rely on other methods in order to study this gam@@ ma@@ -@@ ray light.
We cannot see them with our naked eye.
We can only see an it@@ ty bit@@ ty, tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we call visible light.
And beyond that, we rely on other meth@@ ods.
Yet as astronom@@ ers, we study a wider range of light and we depend on other methods to do that.
On the screen, it may look like this.
You're seeing a plo@@ t.
That is a light curve.
It's a plot of intensity of light over time.
It is a gam@@ ma@@ -@@ ray light curve.
S@@ igh@@ ted astronom@@ ers depend on this kind of plot in order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time.
On the left, you will be seeing the light intensity without a bur@@ st, and on the right, you will be seeing the light intensity with the burst@@ .
Ear@@ ly during my career, I could also see this kind of plo@@ t.
But then, I lost my sight.
I completely lost my sight because of extended illness, and with it, I lost the opportunity to see this plot and the opportunity to do my physics.
It was a very strong transition for me in many ways.
And profession@@ ally, it left me without a way to do my science.
I long@@ ed to access and scr@@ ut@@ in@@ ize this energe@@ tic light and figure out the astr@@ ophys@@ ical cause.
I wanted to experience the spac@@ ious wonder, the excitem@@ ent, the joy produced by the detection of such a tit@@ an@@ ic celesti@@ al event.
I thought long and hard about it, when I suddenly realized that all a light curve is, is a table of numbers converted into a visual plo@@ t.
So along with my collabor@@ ators, we worked really hard and we translated the numbers into sound.
I achieved access to the data, and today I'm able to do physics at the level of the best astronom@@ er, using sound.
And what people have been able to do, mainly visu@@ ally, for hundreds of years, now I do it using sound.
L@@ ist@@ ening to this gam@@ ma@@ -@@ ray burst that you're seeing on the - Thank you.
L@@ ist@@ ening to this burst that you're seeing on the screen brought something to the ear beyond the obvious burst@@ .
Now I'm going to play the burst for you.
It's not music, it's sound.
This is scientific data converted into sound, and it's mapped in pit@@ ch.
So listening to this brought something to the ear besides the obvious burst@@ .
When I examine the very strong low-@@ frequency regi@@ ons, or bas@@ s line - I'm zo@@ om@@ ing into the bas@@ s line now.
We no@@ ted reson@@ ances character@@ istic of electric@@ ally charged g@@ asses like the solar wind.
And I want you to hear what I heard.
You will hear it as a very fast decrease in volume.
And because you're sigh@@ ted, I'm giving you a red line indic@@ ating what intensity of light is being converted into sound.
The is fro@@ gs at home, don't pay attention to that.
I think you heard it, right?
So what we found is that the burst@@ s last long enough in order to support wave reson@@ ances, which are things caused by ex@@ changes of energy between particles that may have been excited, that depend on the volume.
You may remember that I said that the matter around the star is dragged ar@@ ound@@ ?
It transm@@ its power with frequency and field distribution determined by the dimensions.
You may remember that we were talking about a super-@@ massive star that became a very strong magnetic field mag@@ net@@ ar.
If this is the case, then out@@ flows from the explod@@ ing star may be associated with this gam@@ ma@@ -@@ ray burst@@ .
What does that mean?
That star formation may be a very important part of these supernova explos@@ ions.
L@@ ist@@ ening to this very gam@@ ma@@ -@@ ray burst brought us to the notion that the use of sound as an ad@@ jun@@ c@@ tive visual display may also support sigh@@ ted astronom@@ ers in the search for more information in the data.
Sim@@ ul@@ tane@@ ously, I worked on analyzing measurements from other telescop@@ es, and my experiments demonstrated that when you use sound as an ad@@ jun@@ c@@ tive visual dis@@ play, astronom@@ ers can find more information in this now more accessible data set.
This ability to transform data into sound gives astron@@ omy a tremendous power of transformation.
And the fact that a field that is so visual may be improved in order to include anyone with interest in understanding what lies in the heav@@ ens is a spir@@ it-@@ lif@@ ter.
When I lost my s@@ ight, I noticed that I didn't have access to the same amount and quality of information a sigh@@ ted astronom@@ er had.
It was not until we innov@@ ated with the son@@ ific@@ ation process that I reg@@ ained the hope to be a productive member of the field that I had worked so hard to be part of.
Yet, information access is not the only area in astron@@ omy where this is important.
The situation is system@@ ic and scientific fields are not keeping up.
The body is something chan@@ ge@@ able - anyone may develop a disability at any point.
Let's think about, for example, scientists that are already at the top of their care@@ ers.
What happens to them if they develop a dis@@ abil@@ ity?
Will they feel ex@@ communic@@ ated as I did@@ ?
Information access em@@ powers us to flour@@ ish.
It gives us equal opportunities to display our talents and choose what we want to do with our lives, based on interest and not based on potential barri@@ ers.
When we give people the opportunity to succeed without limit@@ s, that will lead to personal fulfil@@ l@@ ment and prosper@@ ing life.
And I think that the use of sound in astron@@ omy is helping us to achieve that and to contribute to science.
While other countries told me that the study of perception techniques in order to study astron@@ omy data is not relevant to astron@@ omy because there are no blind astronom@@ ers in the field, South Africa said, "We want people with dis@@ abilities to contribute to the fiel@@ d."
Right now, I'm working at the South African Astr@@ onom@@ ical Observ@@ ator@@ y, at the Office of Astr@@ on@@ omy for Develop@@ ment.
Ther@@ e, we are working on son@@ ific@@ ation techniques and analysis methods to impact the students of the Ath@@ l@@ one School for the B@@ lin@@ d.
These students will be learning radio astronom@@ y, and they will be learning the son@@ ific@@ ation methods in order to study astronom@@ ical events like huge ej@@ ec@@ tions of energy from the sun, known as cor@@ onal mass ej@@ ec@@ tions.
What we learn with these students - these students have multiple dis@@ abilities and co@@ ping strategies that will be accommod@@ ated - what we learn with these students will directly impact the way things are being done at the professional level.
I hum@@ bly call this development.
And this is happening right now.
I think that science is for everyone.
It belongs to the people, and it has to be available to everyone, because we are all natural explor@@ ers.
I think that if we limit people with dis@@ abilities from participating in science, we'll se@@ ver our links with history and with society.
I dream of a level scientific playing field, where people encourage respect and respect each other, where people exchange strategies and discover together.
If people with dis@@ abilities are allowed into the scientific field, an explos@@ ion, a huge tit@@ an@@ ic burst of knowledge will take place, I am sure.
That is the tit@@ an@@ ic burst@@ .
Thank you.
Thank you.
Pros@@ anta Ch@@ ak@@ rab@@ ar@@ ty@@ : Clu@@ es to pre@@ historic times, found in blind cav@@ ef@@ ish.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: TED Fellow Pros@@ anta Ch@@ ak@@ rab@@ ar@@ ty explores hidden parts of the world in search of new species of cav@@ e-@@ d@@ well@@ ing fish. These subterr@@ ane@@ an creatures have developed fascinating adapt@@ ations, and they provide biological insights into blindness as well as ge@@ ological clues about how the contin@@ ents broke apart million of years ago. Con@@ templ@@ ate deep time in this short talk.
I@@ ch@@ th@@ y@@ ology, the study of fish@@ es.
It looks like a big, boring word, but it's actually quite excit@@ ing, because ich@@ th@@ y@@ ology is the only "@@ olog@@ y" with "Y@@ OL@@ O@@ " in it.
Now, to the cool kids in the audience, you already know, Y@@ OL@@ O stands for "@@ you only live on@@ ce@@ ," and because I only have one life, I'm going to spend it doing what I always dream@@ t of do@@ ing: seeing the hidden wonders of the world and discovering new species.
And that's what I get to do.
Now, in recent years, I really focused on caves for finding new species.
And it turns out, there's lots of new cav@@ ef@@ ish species out there.
You just have to know where to look, and to maybe be a little thin@@ .
Now, cav@@ ef@@ ishes can tell me a lot about biology and ge@@ ology.
They can tell me how the land@@ masses around them have changed and moved by being stuck in these little hol@@ es, and they can tell me about the evolution of s@@ ight, by being blind.
Now, fish have eyes that are essentially the same as our@@ s.
All vertebr@@ ates do, and each time a fish species starts to adapt to this dark, cold, cave environment, over many, many generations, they lose their eyes and their ey@@ es@@ ight until the end up like an ey@@ eless cav@@ ef@@ ish like this one here.
Now, each cav@@ ef@@ ish species has evolved in a slightly different way, and each one has a unique ge@@ ological and biological story to tell us, and that's why it's so exciting when we find a new species.
So this is a new species we descri@@ bed, from southern Indi@@ ana.
We named it Am@@ bl@@ y@@ op@@ s@@ is ho@@ os@@ i@@ er@@ i, the Ho@@ os@@ ier cav@@ ef@@ ish.
Its closest relativ@@ es are cav@@ ef@@ ishes in Kent@@ uck@@ y, in the Mam@@ mo@@ th C@@ ave system.
And they start to diver@@ ge when the Oh@@ io River split them a few million years ago.
And in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blind@@ ness.
There's this gene called rh@@ od@@ op@@ s@@ in that's super-@@ critical for sight.
We have it, and these species have it too, except one species has lost all function in that gene, and the other one maintain@@ s it.
So this sets up this beautiful natural experiment where we can look at the genes behind our vision, and at the very roots of how we can see.
But the genes in these cav@@ ef@@ ishes can also tell us about deep ge@@ ological time, maybe no more so than in this species here.
This is a new species we described from Madagas@@ car that we named Ty@@ ph@@ le@@ o@@ tr@@ is mar@@ ar@@ y@@ be.
That means "@@ big sick@@ ness@@ " in Mal@@ agas@@ y, for how sick we got trying to collect this species.
Now, believe it or not, swimming around sin@@ k@@ holes full of dead things and cave full of bat po@@ op isn't the smar@@ test thing you could be doing with your life, but Y@@ OL@@ O.
Now, I love this species despite the fact that it tried to kill us, and that's because this species in Madagas@@ car, its closest relativ@@ es are 6,000 kilometers away, cav@@ ef@@ ishes in Australia.
Now, there's no way a three-@@ inch@@ -long fresh@@ water cav@@ ef@@ ish can swim across the Indian Oce@@ an, so what we found when we compared the DNA of these species is that they've been separated for more than 100 million years, or about the time that the southern contin@@ ents were last together.
So in fact, these species didn't move at all.
It's the contin@@ ents that moved them.
And so they give us, through their DNA, this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient ge@@ ological events.
Now, this species here is so new I'm not even allowed to tell you its name yet, but I can tell you it's a new species from Mexico, and it's probably already extinc@@ t.
It's probably extinct because the only known cave system it's from was destroyed when a dam was built near@@ by.
Un@@ fortunately for cav@@ ef@@ ish@@ es, their ground@@ water habitat is also our main source of drinking water.
Now, we actually don't know this speci@@ es' closest relativ@@ e, yet.
It doesn't appear to be anything else in Mexico, so maybe it's something in Cub@@ a, or Flor@@ ida, or India.
But whatever it is, it might tell us something new about the ge@@ ology of the Caribbe@@ an, or the biology of how to better diagnose certain types of blind@@ ness.
But I hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too.
And I'm going to spend my one life as an ich@@ th@@ y@@ ologist trying to discover and save these humble little blind cav@@ ef@@ ishes that can tell us so much about the ge@@ ology of the planet and the biology of how we see.
Thank you.
Julia Gal@@ ef@@ : Why you think you're right - even if you're wrong.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Per@@ spec@@ tive is everything, especially when it comes to examin@@ ing your belief@@ s. Are you a soldi@@ er, pr@@ one to def@@ ending your view@@ point at all costs - or a sco@@ ut, sp@@ ur@@ red by curios@@ ity? Julia Gal@@ ef exam@@ ines the motiv@@ ations behind these two mind@@ sets and how they shape the way we interpret information, inter@@ we@@ av@@ ed with a compelling history lesson from 19@@ th-century France. When your stead@@ fast opin@@ ions are teste@@ d, Gal@@ ef ask@@ s: "What do you most year@@ n for? Do you year@@ n to defend your own beliefs or do you year@@ n to see the world as clearly as you possibly can@@ ?"
So I'd like you to imagine for a moment that you're a soldier in the heat of batt@@ le.
Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier or a medieval arch@@ er or maybe you're a Z@@ ul@@ u warri@@ or.
Reg@@ ardless of your time and place, there are some things that are const@@ ant.
Your adr@@ enal@@ ine is elev@@ ated, and your actions are s@@ tem@@ ming from these deeply ing@@ rain@@ ed reflex@@ es, reflex@@ es rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side and to defe@@ at the enem@@ y.
So now, I'd like you to imagine playing a very different role, that of the sco@@ ut.
The sco@@ ut@@ 's job is not to attack or def@@ end.
The sco@@ ut@@ 's job is to understand.
The sco@@ ut is the one going out, mapping the terr@@ ain, identi@@ fying potential obstac@@ les.
And the sco@@ ut may hope to learn that, say, there's a bridge in a convenient location across a river.
But above all, the sco@@ ut wants to know what's really there, as accur@@ ately as possible.
And in a real, actual arm@@ y, both the soldier and the sco@@ ut are essenti@@ al.
But you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset - a metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas in our daily lives.
What I'm going to argue today is that having good judg@@ ment, making accurate predic@@ tions, making good decisions, is mostly about which mindset you're in.
To illustrate these mind@@ sets in action, I'm going to take you back to 19@@ th-century France, where this innoc@@ u@@ ous@@ -@@ looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political s@@ cand@@ als in history.
It was discovered in 18@@ 9@@ 4 by offic@@ ers in the French general staf@@ f.
It was tor@@ n up in a waste@@ paper bas@@ k@@ et, but when they piec@@ ed it back together, they discovered that someone in their ran@@ ks had been selling military secrets to Germany.
So they launched a big investig@@ ation, and their suspic@@ ions quickly conver@@ ged on this man, Alfred Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us.
He had a ster@@ ling record, no past history of wrong@@ doing, no motive as far as they could tel@@ l.
But Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us was the only Jewish officer at that r@@ ank in the arm@@ y, and unfortunately at this time, the French Army was highly anti-@@ Sem@@ i@@ tic.
They compared Dre@@ y@@ fus@@ 's hand@@ writing to that on the me@@ mo and conclu@@ ded that it was a mat@@ ch, even though outside professional hand@@ writing experts were much less confident in the similar@@ ity, but never mind that.
They went and sear@@ ched Dre@@ y@@ fus@@ 's apart@@ ment, looking for any signs of esp@@ ion@@ age.
They went through his fil@@ es, and they didn't find anything.
This just convinced them more that Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us was not only guil@@ ty, but sne@@ ak@@ y as well, because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it.
Nex@@ t, they went and looked through his personal history for any in@@ crimin@@ ating deta@@ ils.
They talked to his teachers, they found that he had studied foreign languages in school, which clearly showed a desire to conspir@@ e with foreign governments later in life.
His teachers also said that Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us was known for having a good memory, which was highly suspic@@ i@@ ous, right?
You know, because a sp@@ y has to remember a lot of things.
So the case went to trial, and Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us was found guil@@ ty.
Af@@ ter@@ wards, they took him out into this public square and ritu@@ alis@@ tically tor@@ e his in@@ sign@@ ia from his uni@@ form and broke his s@@ word in two.
This was called the De@@ grad@@ ation of Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us.
And they sent@@ enced him to life imprison@@ ment on the ap@@ tly named Dev@@ il@@ 's Island, which is this barre@@ n rock off the coast of South America.
So there he went, and there he spent his days alone, writing letters and letters to the French government beg@@ ging them to re@@ open his case so they could discover his innoc@@ ence.
But for the most part, France considered the matter clos@@ ed.
One thing that's really interesting to me about the Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us Af@@ fair is this question of why the offic@@ ers were so convinced that Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us was guil@@ ty.
I mean, you might even assume that they were setting him up, that they were inten@@ tion@@ ally fr@@ aming him.
But histori@@ ans don't think that's what happened.
As far as we can tell, the offic@@ ers genu@@ inely believed that the case against Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us was strong.
Which makes you wonder@@ : What does it say about the human mind that we can find such pal@@ try evidence to be compelling enough to convic@@ t a man?
Well, this is a case of what scientists call "@@ motivated reason@@ ing."
It's this phenomenon in which our un@@ conscious motiv@@ ations, our desire@@ s and fear@@ s, shape the way we interpret information.
Some information, some ideas, feel like our alli@@ es.
We want them to win. We want to defend them.
And other information or ideas are the enem@@ y, and we want to shoot them down.
So this is why I call motivated reason@@ ing, "@@ soldier mind@@ set@@ ."
Probably most of you have never per@@ se@@ cu@@ ted a Fren@@ ch@@ -@@ Jewish officer for high treas@@ on, I assum@@ e, but maybe you've followed sports or politics, so you might have noticed that when the refer@@ e@@ e jud@@ ges that your team committed a f@@ oul@@ , you're highly motivated to find reasons why he's wrong.
But if he jud@@ ges that the other team committed a f@@ ou@@ l - awesome@@ !
That's a good call, let's not examine it too clos@@ ely.
Or, maybe you've read an article or a study that examin@@ ed some controversial policy, like capital punish@@ ment.
And, as researchers have demonstr@@ ated, if you support capital punishment and the study shows that it's not effective, then you're highly motivated to find all the reasons why the study was poor@@ ly desig@@ ned.
But if it shows that capital punishment works, it's a good study.
And vice ver@@ sa@@ : if you don't support capital punish@@ ment, same thing.
Our judgment is strongly influ@@ enc@@ ed, un@@ consci@@ ously, by which side we want to win.
And this is ubiquit@@ ous.
This shapes how we think about our health, our relationships, how we decide how to vo@@ te, what we consider fair or eth@@ ical.
What's most scary to me about motivated reason@@ ing or soldier mind@@ set, is how un@@ conscious it is.
We can think we're being objective and fair@@ -@@ min@@ ded and still wind up ru@@ in@@ ing the life of an innocent man.
However, fortunately for Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us, his story is not over.
This is Col@@ on@@ el Pic@@ quar@@ t.
He's another high-@@ ran@@ king officer in the French Arm@@ y, and like most people, he assumed Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us was guil@@ ty.
Also like most people in the arm@@ y, he was at least cas@@ ually anti-@@ Sem@@ i@@ tic.
But at a certain point, Pic@@ quar@@ t began to suspec@@ t: "What if we're all wrong about Dre@@ y@@ fus@@ ?"
What happened was, he had discovered evidence that the sp@@ ying for Germany had continu@@ ed, even after Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us was in prison.
And he had also discovered that another officer in the army had hand@@ writing that perfectly matched the mem@@ o, much closer than Dre@@ y@@ fus@@ 's hand@@ writing.
So he brought these discoveries to his superi@@ ors, but to his dis@@ ma@@ y, they either didn't care or came up with elaborate ration@@ aliz@@ ations to explain his fin@@ d@@ ings, like, "Well, all you've really sho@@ wn, Pic@@ quar@@ t, is that there's another sp@@ y who learned how to mimic Dre@@ y@@ fus@@ 's hand@@ writing, and he picked up the tor@@ ch of sp@@ ying after Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us left.
But Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us is still guil@@ ty@@ ."
Eventu@@ ally, Pic@@ quar@@ t managed to get Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated.
But it took him 10 years, and for part of that time, he himself was in prison for the crime of dis@@ loy@@ alty to the arm@@ y.
A lot of people feel like Pic@@ quar@@ t can't really be the hero of this story because he was an anti-@@ Sem@@ ite and that's bad, which I agree with.
But personally, for me, the fact that Pic@@ quar@@ t was anti-@@ Sem@@ i@@ tic actually makes his actions more admir@@ able, because he had the same prejud@@ ices, the same reasons to be bi@@ ased as his fellow offic@@ ers, but his motivation to find the truth and up@@ hold it tr@@ um@@ ped all of that.
So to me, Pic@@ quar@@ t is a poster child for what I call "@@ sco@@ ut mind@@ set@@ ."
It's the drive not to make one idea win or another los@@ e, but just to see what's really there as honest@@ ly and accur@@ ately as you can, even if it's not pretty or convenient or pleas@@ ant.
This mindset is what I'm personally passionate about.
And I've spent the last few years examin@@ ing and trying to figure out what causes sco@@ ut mind@@ set.
Why are some people, sometimes at least, able to cut through their own prejud@@ ices and bi@@ ases and motiv@@ ations and just try to see the facts and the evidence as objec@@ tively as they can@@ ?
And the answer is emotion@@ al.
So, just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like defen@@ si@@ ven@@ ess or trib@@ alism, sco@@ ut mindset is, too.
It's just rooted in different emotions.
For example, sco@@ ut@@ s are curi@@ ous.
They're more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new information or an it@@ ch to solve a puzzle.
They're more likely to feel intrigu@@ ed when they encounter something that contradic@@ ts their expect@@ ations.
Sco@@ ut@@ s also have different values.
They're more likely to say they think it's virtu@@ ous to test your own belief@@ s, and they're less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems wea@@ k. And above all, sco@@ ut@@ s are gr@@ oun@@ ded, which means their self-@@ worth as a person isn't tied to how right or wrong they are about any particular topic@@ .
So they can believe that capital punishment works.
If studies come out showing that it does@@ n't, they can say, "H@@ u@@ h. Loo@@ ks like I might be wrong. Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid@@ ."
This clus@@ ter of traits is what researchers have found - and I've also found anec@@ dot@@ ally - predic@@ ts good judg@@ ment.
And the key take@@ away I want to leave you with about those traits is that they're primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know.
In fact, they don't cor@@ relate very much with I@@ Q at all.
They're about how you feel.
There's a quote that I keep coming back to, by S@@ ain@@ t-@@ Ex@@ up@@ ér@@ y.
He's the author of "The Little Prin@@ ce@@ ."
He said, "If you want to build a ship, don't dr@@ um up your men to collect wood and give orders and distribute the work.
Instead, teach them to year@@ n for the vast and endless se@@ a."
In other words, I cla@@ im, if we really want to improve our judgment as individuals and as societies, what we need most is not more instruc@@ tion in logic or rhetor@@ ic or probability or economics, even though those things are quite valu@@ able.
But what we most need to use those principles well is sco@@ ut mind@@ set.
We need to change the way we feel.
We need to learn how to feel proud instead of ash@@ amed when we notice we might have been wrong about something.
We need to learn how to feel intrigu@@ ed instead of defen@@ sive when we encounter some information that contradic@@ ts our belief@@ s.
So the question I want to leave you with is: What do you most year@@ n for?
Do you year@@ n to defend your own belief@@ s?
Or do you year@@ n to see the world as clearly as you possibly can@@ ?
Thank you.
John Leg@@ end@@ : "Re@@ dem@@ ption S@@ ong@@ ".
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: John Le@@ gen@@ d is on a mission to transform America's criminal justice system. Through his Free America campaig@@ n, he's encouraging rehabil@@ itation and healing in our pris@@ ons, jail@@ s and det@@ ention centers - and giving hope to those who want to create a better life after serving their time. With a spok@@ en-@@ word pre@@ lu@@ de from James C@@ av@@ it@@ t, an in@@ mate at San Qu@@ enti@@ n State Pris@@ on, Le@@ gen@@ d tre@@ ats us to his version of Bob Mar@@ le@@ y's "Re@@ dem@@ ption S@@ ong@@ ." "W@@ on@@ 't you help to sing these songs of free@@ dom@@ ?"
At Free America, we've done a listening and learning tour@@ .
We visited not only with prosec@@ ut@@ ors but with legis@@ lat@@ ors, with inmates in our state and local pris@@ ons.
We've gone to immigr@@ ation det@@ ention cent@@ ers.
We've met a lot of people.
And we've seen that re@@ dem@@ ption and transformation can happen in our pris@@ ons, our jail@@ s and our immigr@@ ation det@@ ention centers, giving hope to those who want to create a better life after serving their time.
Imagine if we also considered the front end of this prison pipel@@ ine.
What would it look like if we interven@@ ed, with rehabil@@ itation as a core value - with love and compassion as core valu@@ es?
We would have a society that is sa@@ fer, healthier and worthy of raising our children in.
I want to introduce you to James C@@ av@@ it@@ t.
James served 12 years in the San Qu@@ enti@@ n State Pris@@ on and is being released in 18 months.
Now Jam@@ es, like you and me, is more than the worst thing he's done.
He is a father, a husband, a son, a po@@ et.
He committed a cri@@ me@@ ; he's paying his deb@@ t, and working hard to build the skills to make the transition back to a productive life when he enters the civilian population again.
Now Jam@@ es, like millions of people behind bar@@ s, is an example of what happens if we believe that our fail@@ ings don't define who we are, that we are all worthy of re@@ dem@@ ption and if we support those impac@@ ted by mass incarcer@@ ation, we can all heal together.
I'd like to introduce you to James right now, and he's going to share his journey of re@@ dem@@ ption through spoken word.
James C@@ av@@ it@@ t: Than@@ ks, Joh@@ n.
TED, welcome to San Qu@@ ent@@ in.
The talent is abundant behind prison walls.
Futur@@ e software engineers, entrepreneur@@ s, craf@@ ts@@ men, musicians and artist@@ s.
This piece is inspired by all of the hard work that men and women are doing on the inside to create better lives and fu@@ tures for themselves after they serve their time.
This piece is entit@@ led, "Where I Li@@ ve."
I live in a world where most people are too afraid to go.
Sur@@ r@@ ounded by tal@@ l, concrete walls, steel bar@@ s, where raz@@ or wire have a way of cutting away at the hopes for a brigh@@ ter tomorrow.
I live in a world that kill people who kill people in order to teach people that killing people is wrong.
Imagine that.
Better yet, imagine a world where heal@@ ed people helped hurt people heal and become strong.
Maybe then we would all be sing@@ in@@ ' "Re@@ dem@@ ption S@@ ong@@ ."
I live in a world that has been called "@@ hell on Earth@@ " by those trapped inside.
But I've come to the star@@ k realization that prison - it really is what you make it.
You see, in spite of the har@@ sh@@ ness of my reality, there is a silver lin@@ ing.
I knew that my freedom was gonna come, it was just a matter of time.
And so I treated my first steps as if they were my last mi@@ le, and I realized that you don't have to be free in order to experience freedom.
And just because you're free, doesn't mean that you have freedom.
Many of us, for years, have been batt@@ ling our inner demon@@ s.
We walk around smil@@ ing when inside we're really scre@@ am@@ in@@ '@@ : free@@ dom@@ !
Don't you get it?
We're all serving time@@ ; we're just in different places.
As for me, I choose to be free from the pris@@ ons I've created.
The key@@ : forgi@@ ven@@ ess.
Ac@@ tion@@ 's my wit@@ ness.
If we want freedom, then we gotta think different.
Because freedom ...
It isn't a place.
It's a mind set@@ ting.
Thank you.

Lisa Dy@@ son: A forgotten Space Age technology could change how we grow food.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We're heading for a world population of 10 billion people - but what will we all e@@ at? Lisa Dy@@ son re@@ discovered an idea developed by NASA in the 196@@ 0s for deep-@@ space travel, and it could be a key to reinvent@@ ing how we grow food.
Imagine you are a part of a crew of astronaut@@ s traveling to Mars or some distant planet.
The travel time could take a year or even longer.
The space on board and the resources would be limi@@ ted.
So you and the crew would have to figure out how to produce food with mini@@ mal input@@ s.
What if you could bring with you just a few pack@@ ets of se@@ eds, and grow crops in a matter of hour@@ s?
And what if those crops would then make more se@@ eds, enabling you to feed the entire crew with just those few pack@@ ets of seeds for the dur@@ ation of the tri@@ p@@ ?
Well, the scientists at NASA actually figured out a way to do this.
What they came up with was actually quite interesting.
It involved micro@@ organisms, which are single-@@ cel@@ led organisms.
And they also used hydrogen from water.
The types of microbes that they used were called hydro@@ geno@@ trop@@ h@@ s, and with these hydro@@ geno@@ trop@@ h@@ s, you can create a virtu@@ ous carbon cycle that would sustain life on@@ board a spacec@@ raf@@ t.
Astr@@ on@@ aut@@ s would breathe out carbon diox@@ ide, that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes and converted into a nutri@@ ti@@ ous, carbon@@ -@@ rich cro@@ p.
The astronaut@@ s would then eat that carbon@@ -@@ rich crop and ex@@ hal@@ e the carbon out in the form of carbon diox@@ ide, which would then be captured by the microb@@ es, to create a nutri@@ tious cro@@ p, which then would be ex@@ hal@@ ed in the form of carbon dioxide by the astronaut@@ s.
So in this way, a clos@@ ed-@@ loop carbon cycle is created.
So why is this important?
We need carbon to survive as humans, and we get our carbon from food.
On a long space journey, you simply wouldn't be able to pick up any carbon along the way, so you'd have to figure out how to recy@@ cle it on board.
This is a clever solution, right?
But the thing is, that research didn't really go anywhere.
We haven't yet gone to Mars. We haven't yet gone to another planet.
And this was actually done in the '60s and '70@@ s.
So a colleague of mine, Dr. John Re@@ ed, and I, were intereste@@ d, actually, in carbon recycling here on Earth.
We wanted to come up with technical solutions to address climate change.
And we discovered this research by reading some papers published in the '60s - 196@@ 7 and later - articles about this work.
And we thought it was a really good idea.
So we said, well, Earth is actually like a spaces@@ hi@@ p.
We have limited space and limited resources, and on Earth, we really do need to figure out how to recy@@ cle our carbon better.
So we had the idea, can we take some of these NAS@@ A-@@ type ideas and apply them to our carbon problem here on Earth@@ ?
Could we cultiv@@ ate these NAS@@ A-@@ type microbes in order to make valuable products here on Earth@@ ?
We started a company to do it.
And in that company, we discovered that these hydro@@ geno@@ trop@@ h@@ s - which I'll actually call nature's super@@ charged carbon recycl@@ ers - we found that they are a powerful class of microbes that had been largely over@@ looked and underst@@ u@@ died, and that they could make some really valuable products.
So we began cultiv@@ ating these products, these microb@@ es, in our lab.
We found that we can make essential am@@ ino acid@@ s from carbon dioxide using these microb@@ es.
And we even made a prote@@ in-@@ rich meal that has an am@@ ino acid profile similar to what you might find in some animal prote@@ ins.
We began cultiv@@ ating them even further, and we found that we can make oil.
O@@ ils are used to manufacture many products.
We made an oil that was similar to a ci@@ tr@@ us oil, which can be used for fl@@ avor@@ ing and for fragr@@ ances, but it also can be used as a biodegrad@@ able clean@@ er or even as a jet fuel.
And we made an oil that's similar to palm oil.
Pal@@ m oil is used to manufacture a wide range of consumer and industrial good@@ s.
We began working with manufactur@@ ers to scale up this technology, and we're currently working with them to bring some of these products to market.
We believe this type of technology can indeed help us prof@@ it@@ ably recy@@ cle carbon dioxide into valuable products - something that's benefici@@ al for the planet but also benefici@@ al for business.
That's what we're doing today.
But tomorrow, this type of technology and using these types of microbes actually could help us do something even greater if we take it to the next level.
We believe that this type of technology can actually help us address an issue with agriculture and allow us to create a type of agriculture that's sustain@@ able, that will allow us to scale to meet the demands of tomorrow.
And why might we need a sustainable agricul@@ ture?
Well, actually, it is estimated that the population will reach about 10 billion by 2050, and we're projec@@ ting that we will need to increase food production by 70 percent.
In addition, we will need many more resources and raw materials to make consumer goods and industrial good@@ s.
So how will we scale to meet that demand@@ ?
Well, modern agriculture simply cannot sustain@@ ably scale to meet that dem@@ and.
There are a number of reasons why.
One of them is that modern agriculture is one of the largest emit@@ ters of greenhouse gas@@ es.
In fact, it em@@ its more greenhouse gases than our cars, our truc@@ ks, our planes and our trains combined.
Another reason is that modern a@@ g simply takes up a whole lot of land.
We have clear@@ ed 19@@ .@@ 4 million square miles for crops and livest@@ oc@@ k.
What does that look like?
Well, that's roughly the size of South America and Africa combined.
Let me give you a specific example.
In Indon@@ esia, an amount of vir@@ gin rainforest was clear@@ ed total@@ ing the size of approximately Irel@@ and, between 2000 and 201@@ 2.
Just think of all of the species, the diversity, that was removed in the process, whether plant life, insects or animal life.
And a natural carbon sink was also remo@@ ved.
So let me make this real for you.
This clear@@ ing happened primarily to make room for palm plant@@ ations.
And as I mentioned before, palm oil is used to manufacture many products.
In fact, it is estimated that over 50 percent of consumer products are manufac@@ tured using palm oil.
And that includes things like ice cre@@ am, cook@@ ies ...
It includes cooking o@@ ils.
It also includes deter@@ g@@ ents, lo@@ tions, so@@ ap@@ s.
You and I both probably have numerous items in our kitch@@ ens and our bathro@@ om@@ s that were manufac@@ tured using palm oil.
So you and I are direct benefici@@ aries of removed rain@@ forests.
Moder@@ n a@@ g has some problems, and we need solutions if we want to scale sustain@@ ab@@ ly.
I believe that microbes can be a part of the answer - specifically, these super@@ charged carbon recycl@@ ers.
These super@@ charged carbon recycl@@ ers, like plants, serve as the natural recycl@@ ers in their ecosystems where they thri@@ ve.
And they thri@@ ve in exotic places on Earth, like hydro@@ thermal v@@ ents and hot spr@@ ings.
In those eco@@ systems, they take carbon and recy@@ cle it into the nutrients needed for those eco@@ systems.
And they're rich in nutri@@ ents, such as o@@ ils and prote@@ ins, miner@@ als and carbo@@ hydr@@ ates.
And actually, microbes are already an integral part of our everyday lives.
If you enjoy a glass of pin@@ ot no@@ ir on a Friday night, after a long, hard work week, then you are enjoying a product of microb@@ es.
If you enjoy a beer from your local micro@@ bre@@ wer@@ y - a product of microb@@ es.
Or bread, or che@@ ese, or yog@@ ur@@ t.
These are all products of microb@@ es.
But the beauty and power associated with these super@@ charged carbon recycl@@ ers lies in the fact that they can actually produce in a matter of hours versus months.
That means we can make crops much faster than we're making them today.
They grow in the dark, so they can grow in any season and in any geo@@ graphy and any loc@@ ation.
They can grow in contain@@ ers that require mini@@ mal space.
And we can get to a type of vertical agriculture.
Instead of our traditional horizontal agriculture that requires so much land, we can scale vertic@@ ally, and as a result produce much more product per area.
If we implement this type of approach and use these carbon recycl@@ ers, then we wouldn't have to remove any more rain@@ forests to make the food and the goods that we consum@@ e.
Because, at a large scale, you can actually make 10,000 times more output per land area than you could - for instance, if you used so@@ y@@ be@@ ans - if you planted so@@ y@@ be@@ ans on that same area of land over a period of a year.
Ten thousand times over a period of a year.
So this is what I mean by a new type of agriculture.
And this is what I mean by developing a system that allows us to sustain@@ ably scale to meet the demands of 10 billion.
And what would be the products of this new type of agricul@@ ture?
Well, we've already made a protein me@@ al, so you can imagine something similar to a so@@ y@@ be@@ an me@@ al, or even cor@@ n@@ me@@ al, or wheat flour@@ .
We've already made o@@ ils, so you can imagine something similar to co@@ con@@ ut oil or ol@@ ive oil or so@@ y@@ be@@ an oil.
So this type of crop can actually produce the nutrients that would give us pasta and bread, ca@@ kes, nutri@@ tional items of many sor@@ ts.
Fur@@ ther@@ more, since oil is used to manufacture multiple other good@@ s, industrial products and consumer products, you can imagine being able to make deter@@ g@@ ents, so@@ ap@@ s, lo@@ tions, etc., using these types of cro@@ ps.
Not only are we running out of space, but if we continue to operate under the status quo with modern agriculture, we run the risk of rob@@ bing our pro@@ gen@@ y of a beautiful planet.
But it doesn't have to be this way.
We can imagine a future of abund@@ ance.
Let us create systems that keep planet Earth, our spaces@@ hi@@ p, not only from not crash@@ ing, but let us also develop systems and ways of living that will be benefici@@ al to the lives of ourselves and the 10 billion that will be on this planet by 2050.
Thank you very much.
Mar@@ wa Al-@@ Sab@@ ou@@ ni@@ : How Sy@@ ri@@ a's architecture laid the foundation for brutal war.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What caused the war in Sy@@ ri@@ a? Op@@ press@@ ion, dr@@ ought and religious differences all played key rol@@ es, but Mar@@ wa Al-@@ Sab@@ oun@@ i suggests another reason@@ : architecture. Spe@@ aking to us over the Internet from Hom@@ s, where for the last six years she has watched the war tear her city apart, Al-@@ Sab@@ oun@@ i suggests that Sy@@ ri@@ a's architecture divided its once toler@@ ant and multicul@@ tural society into single-@@ identity en@@ cl@@ aves defined by class and religion. The country's future now depends on how it choos@@ es to re@@ build.
H@@ i. My name is Mar@@ w@@ a, and I'm an architec@@ t.
I was born and raised in Hom@@ s, a city in the central western part of Sy@@ ria, and I've always lived here.
After six years of war, Hom@@ s is now a half-@@ destroyed city.
My family and I were luck@@ y; our place is still stand@@ ing.
Although for two years, we were like prisoners at home.
Out@@ side there were demonstr@@ ations and batt@@ les and bomb@@ ings and sni@@ per@@ s.
My husband and I used to run an architecture studio in the old town main squar@@ e.
It's gone, as is most of the old town itself.
Half of the cit@@ y's other neighborhoods are now rub@@ ble.
Since the ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire in late 2015, large parts of Hom@@ s have been more or less qui@@ et.
The economy is completely brok@@ en, and people are still figh@@ ting.
The mer@@ ch@@ ants who had st@@ alls in the old city market now trade out of sh@@ eds on the streets.
Under our apart@@ ment, there is a carp@@ ent@@ er, swe@@ et@@ sho@@ ps, a but@@ ch@@ er, a printing house, worksho@@ ps, among many more.
I have started teaching part@@ -@@ time, and with my husband, who jug@@ g@@ les several jobs, we've opened a small book@@ sho@@ p.
Other people do all sorts of jobs to get by.
When I look at my destroyed city, of course, I ask my@@ self@@ : What has led to this sen@@ sel@@ ess war@@ ?
Sy@@ ria was largely a place of toler@@ ance, histor@@ ically ac@@ custo@@ med to vari@@ ety, accommod@@ ating a wide range of belief@@ s, origin@@ s, custom@@ s, good@@ s, food.
How did my country - a country with communities living harmon@@ i@@ ously together and comfortable in discussing their differences - how did it de@@ generate into civil war, violence, dis@@ plac@@ ement and unprecedented sec@@ t@@ arian hat@@ red@@ ?
There were many reasons that had led to the war - social, political and econom@@ ic.
They all have played their role.
But I believe there is one key reason that has been over@@ looked and which is important to analy@@ z@@ e, because from it will largely depend whether we can make sure that this doesn't happen again.
And that reason is architecture.
Architec@@ ture in my country has played an important role in cre@@ ating, direc@@ ting and amp@@ lif@@ ying conflict between war@@ ring fac@@ tions, and this is probably true for other countries as well.
There is a sure correspond@@ ence between the architecture of a place and the character of the community that has settled there.
Architec@@ ture plays a key role in whether a community cr@@ umb@@ les or comes together.
Sy@@ ri@@ an society has long lived the co@@ existence of different traditions and back@@ gr@@ ounds.
Sy@@ ri@@ ans have experienced the prosperity of open trade and sustainable communities.
They have enjoyed the true meaning of belong@@ ing to a place, and that was reflected in their built environment, in the mos@@ ques and chur@@ ches built back@@ -to-@@ back, in the inter@@ wo@@ ven sou@@ ks and public venu@@ es, and the propor@@ tions and si@@ zes based on principles of humanity and harmon@@ y.
This architecture of mix@@ ity can still be read in the remain@@ s.
The old Islamic city in Sy@@ ria was built over a multi@@ lay@@ ered past, integr@@ ating with it and embracing its spir@@ it.
So did its communities.
People lived and worked with each other in a place that gave them a sense of belong@@ ing and made them feel at home.
They shared a remarkably uni@@ fied existence.
But over the last century, gradually this delic@@ ate balance of these places has been interfer@@ ed with@@ ; first, by the urban plan@@ ners of the colon@@ ial period, when the French went enthusias@@ tically about, transforming what they saw as the un-@@ modern Sy@@ ri@@ an cities.
They blew up city streets and rel@@ oc@@ ated monument@@ s.
They called them improv@@ em@@ ents, and they were the beginning of a long, slow un@@ r@@ avel@@ ing.
The traditional urban@@ ism and architecture of our cities as@@ sured identity and belong@@ ing not by separ@@ ation, but by inter@@ tw@@ in@@ ing.
But over time, the ancient became worth@@ less, and the new, co@@ ve@@ ted.
The harmony of the built environment and social environment got tr@@ am@@ pled over by elements of modern@@ ity - brut@@ al, un@@ finished concrete bloc@@ ks, neg@@ lec@@ t, aesthetic devast@@ ation, divis@@ ive urban@@ ism that zon@@ ed communities by class, cre@@ ed or af@@ flu@@ ence.
And the same was happening to the community.
As the shape of the built environment changed, so the lifesty@@ les and sense of belong@@ ing of the communities also started changing.
From a reg@@ ister of together@@ ness, of belong@@ ing, architecture became a way of differenti@@ ation, and communities started drif@@ ting apart from the very fabric that used to un@@ ite them, and from the soul of the place that used to represent their common existence.
While many reasons had led to the Sy@@ ri@@ an war, we shouldn't under@@ estimate the way in which, by contributing to the loss of identity and self-@@ respect, urban zon@@ ing and mis@@ guid@@ ed, inh@@ um@@ ane architecture have nur@@ tured sec@@ t@@ arian divis@@ ions and hat@@ red.
Over time, the uni@@ ted city has morph@@ ed into a city center with gh@@ et@@ tos along its circum@@ fer@@ ence.
And in turn, the coher@@ ent communities became distinct social groups, alien@@ ated from each other and alien@@ ated from the place.
From my point of view, losing the sense of belong@@ ing to a place and a sense of sharing it with someone else has made it a lot easier to destro@@ y.
The clear example can be seen in the informal housing system, which used to hos@@ t, before the war, over 40 percent of the population.
Yes, prior to the war, almost half of the Sy@@ ri@@ an population lived in slum@@ s, peripher@@ al areas without proper infrastructure, made of endless rows of bare block boxes contain@@ ing people, people who mostly belong@@ ed to the same group, whether based on religion, class, origin or all of the abo@@ ve.
This gh@@ et@@ to@@ ized urban@@ ism proved to be a tangible pre@@ cursor of war.
Con@@ flic@@ t is much easier between pre-@@ categoriz@@ ed areas - where the "@@ other@@ s" live.
The ties that used to bin@@ d the city together - whether they were social, through coher@@ ent building, or econom@@ ic, through trade in the sou@@ k, or religi@@ ous, through the co@@ exist@@ ent presence - were all lost in the mis@@ guid@@ ed and vision@@ less modern@@ ization of the built environment.
Al@@ low me an as@@ ide.
When I read about heter@@ og@@ ene@@ ous urban@@ ism in other parts of the world, involving ethnic neighborhoods in British cities or around Paris or Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s, I recognize the beginning of the kind of inst@@ ability we have witnessed so dis@@ astr@@ ously here in Sy@@ ria.
We have sever@@ ely destroyed cities, such as Hom@@ s, Ale@@ pp@@ o, Dar@@ a@@ a and many others, and almost half of the population of the country is now dis@@ plac@@ ed.
Hope@@ fully, the war will end, and the question that, as an architect, I have to ask, is: How do we re@@ build@@ ?
What are the principles that we should adopt in order to avoid repe@@ ating the same mistak@@ es?
From my point of view, the main focus should be on creating places that make their people feel they belong@@ .
Architec@@ ture and planning need to re@@ capture some of the traditional values that did just that, creating the conditions for co@@ existence and peace, values of beauty that don't exhibit os@@ tent@@ ation, but rather, approach@@ ability and eas@@ e, moral values that promote generos@@ ity and accept@@ ance, architecture that is for everyone to enjo@@ y, not just for the eli@@ te, just as used to be in the shado@@ wed al@@ le@@ ys of the old Islamic city, mixed designs that encourage a sense of community.
There is a neighborhood here in Hom@@ s that's called Bab@@ a Am@@ r that has been fully destroy@@ ed.
Almost two years ago, I introduced this design into a UN@@ -@@ Hab@@ it@@ at competition for re@@ building it.
The idea was to create an urban fabric inspired by a tree, capable of growing and spreading organ@@ ically, e@@ cho@@ ing the traditional bridge hanging over the old al@@ le@@ ys, and incorpor@@ ating apart@@ ments, private cour@@ ty@@ ar@@ ds, sho@@ ps, worksho@@ ps, places for parking and playing and le@@ is@@ ure, trees and sh@@ aded areas.
It's far from perfect, obvi@@ ously.
I drew it during the few hours of electricity we get.
And there are many possible ways to express belong@@ ing and community through architecture.
But compare it with the fre@@ est@@ and@@ ing, dis@@ connected blocks proposed by the official project for re@@ building Bab@@ a Am@@ r.
Architec@@ ture is not the axis around which all human life rot@@ ates, but it has the power to suggest and even direct human activity.
In that sense, settle@@ ment, identity and social integration are all the produc@@ er and product of effective urban@@ ism.
The coher@@ ent urban@@ ism of the old Islamic city and of many old European town@@ s, for instance, promote integr@@ ation, while rows of soul@@ less housing or tower bloc@@ ks, even when they are lux@@ uri@@ ous, tend to promote isol@@ ation and "@@ other@@ ness@@ ."
Even simple things like sh@@ aded places or fruit plants or drinking water inside the city can make a difference in how people feel towards the place, and whether they consider it a generous place that gi@@ ves, a place that's worth keep@@ ing, contributing to, or whether they see it as an alien@@ ating place, full of seeds of ang@@ er.
In order for a place to gi@@ ve, its architecture should be gi@@ ving, too.
Our built environment matters.
The fabric of our cities is reflected in the fabric of our soul@@ s.
And whether in the shape of informal concrete slums or broken social housing or tr@@ am@@ pled old towns or forests of sk@@ ys@@ cr@@ aper@@ s, the contemporary urban arch@@ et@@ y@@ pes that have emerged all across the Middle East have been one cause of the alien@@ ation and fragment@@ ation of our communities.
We can learn from this.
We can learn how to rebuild in another way, how to create an architecture that doesn't contribute only to the practical and economic aspects of people's lives, but also to their social, spiritual and psychological needs.
Those needs were totally over@@ looked in the Sy@@ ri@@ an cities before the war.
We need to create again cities that are shared by the communities that inhab@@ it them.
If we do so, people will not feel the need to seek identi@@ ties opposed to the other identi@@ ties all around, because they will all feel at home.
Thank you for listening.
Eric Has@@ el@@ tin@@ e: What will be the next big scientific break@@ through@@ ?
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Throughout history, specul@@ ation has sp@@ ur@@ red beautiful, revolutionary science - opening our eyes to entirely new univers@@ es. "I'm not talking about science that takes baby ste@@ p@@ s," says Eric Has@@ el@@ tin@@ e. "I'm talking about science that takes enormous leap@@ s." In this talk, Has@@ el@@ t@@ ine passion@@ ately takes us to the edges of intellectual pursuit with two ideas - one that's already made history, and the other that's digging into one of humanit@@ y's biggest questions with admir@@ able ambi@@ tion .
Ton@@ ight, I'm going to share with you my passion for science.
I'm not talking about science that takes baby steps.
I'm talking about science that takes enormous leap@@ s.
I'm talking Darwin, I'm talking Einstein, I'm talking revolutionary science that turns the world on its head.
In a moment, I'm going to talk about two ideas that might do this.
I say "@@ m@@ ight@@ " because, with revolutionary ideas, most are flat wrong, and even those that are right sel@@ dom have the impact that we want them to have.
To explain why I picked two ideas in particular, I'm going to start with a myster@@ y.
18@@ 4@@ 7, Vi@@ enn@@ a, Aus@@ tri@@ a.
Ig@@ n@@ az Sem@@ mel@@ we@@ is was a so@@ mb@@ er, compul@@ si@@ vely thor@@ ough doctor who ran two matern@@ ity clin@@ ics.
They were identical except for one thing.
Women were dying of high fe@@ vers soon after giving birth three times more often at one of the clinics than at the other.
Tr@@ ying to figure out what the difference was that caused this, Sem@@ mel@@ we@@ is looked at everything he could.
S@@ an@@ it@@ ation? No.
Medical proced@@ ur@@ es? No.
Air flow@@ ? No.
The puzzle went un@@ solved until he happened to auto@@ p@@ sy a doctor who died of an infected scal@@ pel cut@@ .
The doctor@@ 's symptoms were identical to those of the mothers who were dying.
How was that possible?
How could a male doctor get the same thing as new mother@@ s?
Sem@@ mel@@ we@@ is re@@ constructed everything the doctor had done right before he got sick, and he discovered that he'd been auto@@ psy@@ ing a corp@@ se.
H@@ ad something gotten in his wound that killed him@@ ?
With growing excitem@@ ent, Sem@@ mel@@ we@@ is looked for any connection he could between dead bodies in the mor@@ gue and dead mothers in his delivery room, and he found it.
It turned out that at the hospital with the high death rate, but not the others, doctors delivered babies immediately after auto@@ psy@@ ing corp@@ ses in the mor@@ gue.
A@@ ha@@ ! Cor@@ p@@ ses were contamin@@ ating the doctor@@ s' hands and killing his mother@@ s.
So he ordered the doctors to ster@@ il@@ ize their hands, and the deaths stop@@ ped.
Dr. Ig@@ n@@ az Sem@@ mel@@ we@@ is had discovered infectious disease.
But the doctors of the day thought he was crazy, because they knew, and had for hundreds of years, that od@@ or@@ ous vap@@ ors called mi@@ as@@ mas caused disease, not these hypo@@ the@@ tical particles that you couldn't see.
It took 20 years for Fren@@ ch@@ man Louis Pas@@ te@@ ur to prove that Sem@@ mel@@ we@@ is was right.
Pas@@ te@@ ur was an agricultural chem@@ ist who tried to figure out why milk and beer spo@@ iled so often.
He found that bacteria were the cul@@ pr@@ its.
He also found that bacteria could kill people in exactly the same way that Sem@@ mel@@ we@@ is@@ 's patients were dying.
We now look at what I want to talk about tonight, in two ideas.
We saw it with Sem@@ mel@@ we@@ is, that he was a revolution@@ ary.
He did it for two reasons.
One, he opened our eyes to a completely new world.
We'd known since the 16@@ 80@@ s about bacteria.
We just didn't know that bacteria killed people.
And he also demol@@ ished fon@@ d ideas that people kept close to their heart.
Mi@@ as@@ mas didn't kill people. Bac@@ teria killed people.
So this brings me to the two ideas I want to talk about ton@@ ight.
One has opened our eyes to a completely new universe, and the other attacks long-@@ held belief@@ s.
Let's get started with Dr. Eric Bet@@ z@@ ig@@ .
He's a physicist who has opened our eyes to an entirely new world by viol@@ ating the laws of physics.
Bet@@ zi@@ g is a true rebel@@ .
He quit a job at presti@@ gi@@ ous Bell Labor@@ atory invent@@ ing new microscop@@ es for biology because he thought scientists were taking his brilliant inven@@ tions and doing l@@ ous@@ y work with them.
So he became a house@@ husband, but he never lost his passion for figuring out how to get microscop@@ es to see fin@@ er and fin@@ er details than had ever been seen before or ever could be seen.
This is crucial if we're ever going to understand how cells work, and how cancer works, and how something 1@@ 50@@ th the size of a head of a pin can do all these amazing things, like make proteins and move charges around and all of those things.
There's just one problem.
There's this thing called the law of physics, and part of the law of physics is the thing called the dif@@ fraction lim@@ it.
The dif@@ fraction limit is kind of like when you go to a doctor@@ 's office, you can only see so far down, no matter how good glasses you have.
This was a so-called impossible problem.
But one of Bet@@ z@@ ig@@ 's friends figured out how to take a tiny molecule that was smaller than the best microscope could see and get it to light up and fluoresc@@ e.
"A@@ ha@@ !" Bet@@ zi@@ g said.
"I think maybe the laws of physics are not so un@@ break@@ able after all@@ ."
So he l@@ ashed together a microscope in his friend's living room.
He had no laborator@@ y.
This revolutionary instrument got different protein molecules to light up in different colors, and with a computer, he was able to turn very, very fuzz@@ y blur@@ s into very sharp dots and produce images of unprecedented and start@@ ling clar@@ ity.
For this work, last year, Eric Bet@@ zi@@ g won the Nobel Priz@@ e.
Why?
Because now we can see with unprecedented detail things that we never had seen before, and now doctors can get a better handle on things like cancer.
But do you think Bet@@ zi@@ g was satis@@ fied there?
No.
He wanted movies.
The problem was that even the genius microscop@@ es that he invented were just too slow.
So what did he do?
He came up with a 200@@ -year-old idea called mo@@ ir@@ é patterns.
So the way that works is if you take two very, very fine patterns and you move them across each other, you will see a gross pattern that a microscope can see that otherwise you would not be able to see.
So he applied this technique to taking a really blur@@ ry image of a cell and moving lots of struc@@ tured light patterns across it until this cell became cryst@@ al clear.
And here is the result@@ : a mysterious new world, full of strange things zi@@ pping around doing things that we don't know what they're doing.
But when we figure it out, we'll have a better handle on life itself.
For example, those green glob@@ s that you see?
Those things are called cla@@ thr@@ ins.
They're molecules that protect other molecules as they move through a cell.
Unfortunately, viruses sometimes hi@@ j@@ ack those to infec@@ t cells.
Also, you see those little squ@@ ig@@ g@@ ly wor@@ m@@ like things moving ar@@ ound@@ ?
Those are ac@@ tin molecul@@ es.
Unfortunately, viruses also climb down those things to get into the cell nucle@@ us to replicate themselves and make you sick.
Now that we can look at movies of what's actually going on deep inside a cell, we have a much better chance of cur@@ ing viral diseases like AIDS.
So when you look at a movie like this, it's very clear that Bet@@ zi@@ g has opened our eyes to a completely new world.
But he hasn't shat@@ tered any cher@@ ished belief@@ s.
That leads us to Dr. A@@ ub@@ re@@ y de Gre@@ y at Cambrid@@ ge.
De Gre@@ y definitely has scientists squ@@ ir@@ ming with an interesting idea: we can be im@@ mortal@@ .
We can beat aging.
Now, most scientists think he's a crack@@ po@@ t.
Any Bi@@ ology 10@@ 1 student knows that aging is an inevitable consequence of living.
For example, when we eat, we take in food and we metabol@@ ize it, and that thro@@ ws off what we call free radic@@ als.
You might have heard of those.
Also known as oxygen ions, those bin@@ d to our DNA, cause it to mu@@ ta@@ te, and cause us to get old and lose our hair.
It's just like, no, it's exactly like oxygen b@@ inding to iron and making it rus@@ t.
So you age because you r@@ ust out.
Oh, and scientists also know there is something called im@@ mortal@@ ity: in cancer cells.
So if you stop aging, all of you are going to turn into giant walking mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ ors.
These are cher@@ ished belief@@ s, but could de Gre@@ y be on to some@@ thing?
I think he deserves a closer look.
First of all, I have a really hard time seeing him as a crack@@ po@@ t.
Yeah, he started off life as a computer scientist, not a biolog@@ ist, but he earned a Ph@@ D in biology from Cambridge, and he has published some very significant work on mit@@ oc@@ hon@@ dri@@ al DNA and a bunch of other stuff.
Secondly, he started an anti@@ aging foundation that has identified seven different causes of aging, to me, that seem very plaus@@ ible, and he is hot in pursuit of fix@@ es for every single one of them.
For example, one of the reasons we age is that our mit@@ oc@@ hon@@ dri@@ al DNA mut@@ ates, and we get kind of old and our cells lose energy.
He believ@@ es, and he's made a convincing case, that using viruses we can do gene therap@@ y, fix that DNA and re@@ juven@@ ate our cells.
One more thing.
We have an exist@@ ent proof that extreme longev@@ ity is possible.
Br@@ ist@@ le@@ cone p@@ ine trees live 5,000 years, and some lob@@ sters don't age at all.
Now, this doesn't mean that de Gre@@ y is going to revolution@@ ize our lifesp@@ ans.
I mean, after all, we're not trees, and most of us are not lob@@ st@@ ers.
But I've got to believe that there are Darwin@@ s and Einste@@ ins out there, and I'll tell you why.
Consider this: there are seven times more people alive today than during Darwin@@ 's time.
There are four times as many people alive today as Einste@@ in.
When you consider that the proportion of scientists in the population has sky@@ roc@@ ke@@ ted, there are now seven million scientists.
I've got to believe, and I do believe, that there's one of them out there who is working right now in obscur@@ ity to rock our lives, and I don't know about you, but I can't wait to be rock@@ ed.
Thank you.
Alexander Bet@@ ts: Why Bre@@ x@@ it happened - and what to do next.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We are embarrass@@ ingly un@@ aware of how divided our societies are, and Bre@@ x@@ it grew out of a deep, un@@ examin@@ ed divide between those that fear globalization and those that embrace it, says social scientist Alexander Bet@@ ts. How do we now address that fear as well as growing dis@@ illus@@ ion@@ ment with the political establ@@ ish@@ ment, while ref@@ using to give in to x@@ en@@ op@@ hob@@ ia and nation@@ alis@@ m? Jo@@ in Bet@@ ts as he discus@@ ses four post-@@ Bre@@ x@@ it steps toward a more inclusive world.
I am Bri@@ ti@@ sh@@ .
Never before has the phrase "I am Bri@@ ti@@ sh@@ " el@@ ici@@ ted so much p@@ ity.
I come from an island where many of us like to believe there's been a lot of continu@@ ity over the last thousand years.
We tend to have histor@@ ically imposed change on others but done much less of it ourselves.
So it came as an immense shock to me when I woke up on the morning of June 24 to discover that my country had voted to leave the European Uni@@ on, my Prime Minister had res@@ ig@@ ned, and Scot@@ land was considering a refer@@ end@@ um that could bring to an end the very existence of the United King@@ dom.
So that was an immense shock for me, and it was an immense shock for many people, but it was also something that, over the following several days, created a complete political mel@@ t@@ down in my country.
There were calls for a second refer@@ end@@ um, almost as if, following a sports mat@@ ch, we could ask the op@@ position for a re@@ play.
Everybody was bl@@ aming everybody else.
People bl@@ amed the Prime Minister for calling the refer@@ end@@ um in the first place.
They bl@@ amed the leader of the op@@ position for not fighting it hard enough.
The young ac@@ cu@@ sed the old.
The educated bl@@ amed the less well-@@ educa@@ ted.
That complete mel@@ t@@ down was made even worse by the most tragic element of it: levels of x@@ en@@ op@@ hob@@ ia and rac@@ ist abuse in the streets of Britain at a level that I have never seen before in my lifetime.
People are now talking about whether my country is becoming a Little England, or, as one of my colleagues put it, whether we're about to become a 1950@@ s nostal@@ gia theme park floating in the Atlantic Oce@@ an.
But my question is really, should we have the degree of shock that we've experienced sin@@ ce?
Was it something that took place over@@ nigh@@ t?
Or are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today?
So I want to take a step back and ask two very basic questions.
First, what does Bre@@ x@@ it represent@@ , not just for my country, but for all of us around the world?
And second, what can we do about it?
How should we all respond@@ ?
So first, what does Bre@@ x@@ it represent@@ ?
Hind@@ sight is a wonderful thing.
Bre@@ x@@ it teaches us many things about our society and about societies around the world.
It high@@ lights in ways that we seem embarrass@@ ingly un@@ aware of how divided our societies are.
The vote split along lines of age, education, class and geograph@@ y.
Young people didn't turn out to vote in great numbers, but those that did wanted to rema@@ in.
Ol@@ der people really wanted to leave the European Uni@@ on.
Geograph@@ ically, it was London and Scot@@ land that most strongly committed to being part of the European Uni@@ on, while in other parts of the country there was very strong ambi@@ val@@ ence.
Those divis@@ ions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously.
But more profound@@ ly, the vote teaches us something about the nature of politics today.
Con@@ temporary politics is no longer just about right and left.
It's no longer just about tax and spen@@ d.
It's about globaliz@@ ation.
The fault line of contemporary politics is between those that embrace globalization and those that fear globaliz@@ ation.
If we look at why those who wanted to leave - we call them "@@ Le@@ aver@@ s," as opposed to "Re@@ main@@ er@@ s" - we see two factors in the opinion pol@@ ls that really mat@@ ter@@ ed.
The first was immigr@@ ation, and the second sovere@@ ign@@ ty, and these represent a desire for people to take back control of their own lives and the feeling that they are un@@ represented by politici@@ ans.
But those ideas are ones that signi@@ fy fear and alien@@ ation.
They represent a re@@ treat back towards nation@@ alism and borders in ways that many of us would rejec@@ t.
What I want to suggest is the picture is more complicated than that, that liberal internation@@ al@@ ists, like myself, and I firmly include myself in that picture, need to write ourselves back into the picture in order to understand how we've got to where we are today.
When we look at the voting patterns across the United King@@ dom, we can vis@@ ib@@ ly see the di@@ vision@@ s.
The blue areas show Re@@ main and the red areas Le@@ av@@ e.
When I looked at this, what personally struck me was the very little time in my life I've actually spent in many of the red areas.
I suddenly realized that, looking at the top 50 areas in the U@@ K that have the strong@@ est Le@@ ave vo@@ te, I've spent a combined total of four days of my life in those areas.
In some of those places, I didn't even know the names of the voting distric@@ ts.
It was a real shock to me, and it suggested that people like me who think of ourselves as inclus@@ ive, open and toler@@ ant, perhaps don't know our own countries and societies nearly as well as we like to believe.
And the challenge that comes from that is we need to find a new way to narr@@ ate globalization to those people, to recognize that for those people who have not necessarily been to university, who haven't necessarily grown up with the Internet, that don't get opportunities to travel, they may be un@@ persu@@ aded by the narrative that we find persuas@@ ive in our often liberal bub@@ bles.
It means that we need to reach out more broad@@ ly and understand.
In the Le@@ ave vo@@ te, a minority have ped@@ d@@ led the politics of fear and hat@@ red, creating lies and mis@@ trust around, for instance, the idea that the vote on Europe could reduce the number of refugees and as@@ yl@@ um-@@ see@@ kers coming to Europe, when the vote on leaving had nothing to do with immigr@@ ation from outside the European Uni@@ on.
But for a significant majority of the Le@@ ave vo@@ ters the concern was dis@@ illus@@ ion@@ ment with the political establ@@ ish@@ ment.
This was a protest vote for many, a sense that nobody represented them, that they couldn't find a political party that spoke for them, and so they rejected that political establ@@ ish@@ ment.
This replic@@ ates around Europe and much of the liberal democratic world.
We see it with the rise in popular@@ ity of Donal@@ d Tr@@ um@@ p in the United States, with the growing nation@@ alism of V@@ ik@@ tor Or@@ bá@@ n in Hun@@ gar@@ y, with the increase in popular@@ ity of Marine L@@ e P@@ en in France.
The spec@@ ter of Bre@@ x@@ it is in all of our societies.
So the question I think we need to ask is my second question, which is how should we collectively respond@@ ?
For all of us who care about creating liber@@ al, open, toler@@ ant societies, we urg@@ ently need a new vision, a vision of a more toler@@ ant, inclusive globaliz@@ ation, one that brings people with us rather than leaving them behind.
That vision of globalization is one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globaliz@@ ation.
The consensus amongst economists is that free trade, the movement of capital, the movement of people across borders benefit everyone on aggreg@@ ate.
The consensus amongst international relations schol@@ ars is that globalization brings interdepend@@ ence, which brings cooperation and peace.
But globalization also has re@@ distribu@@ tive effects.
It creates win@@ ners and los@@ ers.
To take the example of migr@@ ation, we know that immigr@@ ation is a net positive for the economy as a whole under almost all circumstances.
But we also have to be very aware that there are re@@ distribu@@ tive consequ@@ ences, that importantly, low-@@ skilled immigr@@ ation can lead to a reduction in w@@ ages for the most im@@ pover@@ ished in our societies and also put pressure on house pr@@ ices.
That doesn't de@@ tract from the fact that it's positive, but it means more people have to share in those benefits and recognize them.
In 2002, the former Secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ General of the United N@@ ations, K@@ of@@ i Ann@@ an, gave a speech at Yale University, and that speech was on the topic of inclusive globaliz@@ ation.
That was the speech in which he co@@ ined that term.
And he said, and I par@@ aph@@ ras@@ e, "The glass house of globalization has to be open to all if it is to remain sec@@ ure.
B@@ ig@@ o@@ try and ignorance are the ugly face of exclus@@ ion@@ ary and ant@@ agon@@ istic globaliz@@ ation."
That idea of inclusive globalization was briefly re@@ viv@@ ed in 2008 in a conference on progress@@ ive governance involving many of the leaders of European countries.
But am@@ id aus@@ ter@@ ity and the financial crisis of 2008, the concept disappeared almost without a trac@@ e.
Glob@@ alization has been taken to support a ne@@ oli@@ ber@@ al agenda.
It's perceived to be part of an elite agenda rather than something that benefits all.
And it needs to be re@@ claimed on a far more inclusive basis than it is today.
So the question is, how can we achieve that go@@ al?
How can we balance on the one hand addressing fear and alien@@ ation while on the other hand ref@@ using ve@@ hem@@ ently to give in to x@@ en@@ op@@ hob@@ ia and nation@@ alis@@ m?
That is the question for all of us.
And I think, as a social scientist, that social science offers some places to start.
Our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change, and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point.
The first relates to the idea of civic education.
What stands out from Bre@@ x@@ it is the gap between public perception and empir@@ ical reality.
It's been suggested that we've moved to a post@@ fac@@ tual society, where evidence and truth no longer matter, and lies have equal status to the clar@@ ity of evidence.
So how can we - How can we rebuild respect for truth and evidence into our liberal democrac@@ i@@ es?
It has to begin with education, but it has to start with the recognition that there are huge gap@@ s.
In 2014, the pol@@ l@@ ster I@@ p@@ sos MO@@ R@@ I published a survey on attitudes to immigr@@ ation, and it showed that as numbers of immigr@@ ants increas@@ e, so public concern with immigr@@ ation also increas@@ es, although it obviously didn't un@@ pack caus@@ ality, because this could equally be to do not so much with numbers but the political and media narrative around it.
But the same survey also revealed huge public mis@@ information and mis@@ understanding about the nature of immigr@@ ation.
For example, in these attitudes in the United King@@ dom, the public believed that levels of as@@ yl@@ um were a greater proportion of immigr@@ ation than they were, but they also believed the levels of educational migr@@ ation were far lower as a proportion of overall migr@@ ation than they actually are.
So we have to address this mis@@ information, the gap between perception and reality on key aspects of globaliz@@ ation.
And that can't just be something that's left to our schools, although that's important to begin at an early age.
It has to be about lifel@@ ong civic participation and public engagement that we all encourage as societies.
The second thing that I think is an opportunity is the idea to encourage more interaction across diverse communities.
One of the things that stands out for me very strik@@ ingly, looking at immigr@@ ation attitudes in the United King@@ dom, is that iron@@ ically, the regions of my country that are the most toler@@ ant of immigr@@ ants have the highest numbers of immigr@@ ants.
So for instance, London and the Sou@@ theast have the highest numbers of immigr@@ ants, and they are also by far the most toler@@ ant areas.
It's those areas of the country that have the lowest levels of immigr@@ ation that actually are the most exclus@@ ion@@ ary and intoler@@ ant towards migr@@ ants.
So we need to encourage exchange programs.
We need to ensure that older generations who maybe can't travel get access to the Internet.
We need to encour@@ age, even on a local and national level, more movement, more particip@@ ation, more interaction with people who we don't know and whose views we might not necessarily agree with.
The third thing that I think is cruci@@ al, though, and this is really fundamental, is we have to ensure that everybody shares in the benefits of globaliz@@ ation.
This illustr@@ ation from the Fin@@ ancial Times post-@@ Bre@@ x@@ it is really strik@@ ing.
It shows trag@@ ically that those people who voted to leave the European Union were those who actually bene@@ fi@@ ted the most materi@@ ally from trade with the European Uni@@ on.
But the problem is that those people in those areas didn't perceive themselves to be benefici@@ aries.
They didn't believe that they were actually getting access to material benefits of increased trade and increased mobility around the world.
I work on questions predomin@@ antly to do with refuge@@ es, and one of the ideas I spent a lot of my time pre@@ ach@@ ing, mainly to developing countries around the world, is that in order to encourage the integration of refuge@@ es, we can't just benefit the refugee popul@@ ations, we also have to address the concerns of the host communities in local areas.
But in looking at that, one of the policy prescrip@@ tions is that we have to provide dis@@ proportion@@ ately better education facil@@ ities, health facil@@ ities, access to social services in those regions of high immigr@@ ation to address the concerns of those local popul@@ ations.
But while we encourage that around the developing world, we don't take those lessons home and incorpor@@ ate them in our own societies.
Fur@@ ther@@ more, if we're going to really take seriously the need to ensure people share in the economic benef@@ its, our businesses and corporations need a model of globalization that recognizes that they, too, have to take people with them.
The fourth and final idea I want to put forward is an idea that we need more responsible politics.
There's very little social science evidence that compar@@ es attitudes on globaliz@@ ation.
But from the surve@@ ys that do exist, what we can see is there's huge variation across different countries and time periods in those countries for attitudes and toler@@ ance of questions like migr@@ ation and mobility on the one hand and free trade on the other.
But one hypothesis that I think emerg@@ es from a cur@@ sor@@ y look at that data is the idea that polar@@ ized societies are far less toler@@ ant of globaliz@@ ation.
It's the societies like Sweden in the past, like Canada today, where there is a centr@@ ist politics, where right and left work together, that we encourage supportive attitudes towards globaliz@@ ation.
And what we see around the world today is a tragic polariz@@ ation, a failure to have dialogue between the extre@@ mes in politics, and a gap in terms of that liberal center ground that can encourage communication and a shared understanding.
We might not achieve that today, but at the very least we have to call upon our politicians and our media to drop a language of fear and be far more toler@@ ant of one another.
These ideas are very tent@@ ative, and that's in part because this needs to be an inclusive and shared project.
I am still Bri@@ ti@@ sh@@ .
I am still Europe@@ an.
I am still a global citiz@@ en.
For those of us who believe that our identi@@ ties are not mutu@@ ally exclus@@ ive, we have to all work together to ensure that globalization takes everyone with us and doesn't leave people behind.
Only then will we truly reconc@@ ile democracy and globaliz@@ ation.
Thank you.
Sh@@ ub@@ h@@ end@@ u Shar@@ ma: How to grow a forest in your backyar@@ d.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: For@@ ests don't have to be far-@@ fl@@ ung nature reserv@@ es, isolated from human life. Instead, we can grow them right where we are - even in cities. E@@ co-@@ entrepreneur and TED Fellow Sh@@ ub@@ h@@ end@@ u Shar@@ ma grows ultra-@@ den@@ se, bio@@ diverse mini-@@ forests of native species in urban areas by engineering soil, microbes and biomass to kick@@ start natural growth processes. Fol@@ low along as he describes how to grow a 100@@ -year-old forest in just 10 years, and learn how you can get in on this tiny jung@@ le party.
This is a man-@@ made forest.
It can spread over acres and acres of area, or it could fit in a small space - as small as your house garden.
Each of these forests is just two years old.
I have a forest in the back@@ yard of my own house.
It attrac@@ ts a lot of biodivers@@ ity.
I wake up to this every morning, like a Disney princ@@ ess.
I am an entrepreneur who facilit@@ ates the making of these forests profession@@ ally.
We have helped factor@@ ies, far@@ ms, schools, homes, resor@@ ts, apartment buildings, public parks and even a zo@@ o to have one of such forests.
A forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together.
A forest can be an integral part of our urban existence.
A forest, for me, is a place so dense with trees that you just can't walk into it.
It doesn't matter how big or small they are.
Most of the world we live in today was forest.
This was before human interven@@ tion.
Then we built up our cities on those forests, like São Paul@@ o, for@@ getting that we belong to nature as well, as much as 8.@@ 4 million other species on the planet.
Our habitat stopped being our natural habit@@ at.
But not anymore for some of us.
A few others and I today make these forests profession@@ ally - anywhere and everywhere.
I'm an industrial engine@@ er.
I speci@@ alize in making cars.
In my previous job at To@@ y@@ ota, I learned how to convert natural resources into products.
To give you an example, we would dri@@ p the sa@@ p out of a rubber tree, convert it into raw rubber and make a tire out of it - the product.
But these products can never become a natural resource again.
We separate the elements from nature and convert them into an irrever@@ sible state.
That's industrial production.
N@@ ature, on the other hand, works in a totally opposite way.
The natural system produces by bringing elements together, at@@ om by atom@@ .
All the natural products become a natural resource again.
This is something which I learned when I made a forest in the back@@ yard of my own house.
And this was the first time I worked with nature, rather than against it.
Since then, we have made 75 such forests in 25 cities across the world.
Every time we work at a new place, we find that every single element needed to make a forest is available right around us.
All we have to do is to bring these elements together and let nature take over.
To make a forest we start with soil.
We tou@@ ch, feel and even taste it to identify what properties it l@@ ack@@ s.
If the soil is made up of small particles it becomes comp@@ act - so compac@@ t, that water cannot se@@ ep in.
We mix some local biomass available around, which can help soil become more por@@ ous.
W@@ ater can now se@@ ep in.
If the soil doesn't have the capacity to hold water, we will mix some more biomass - some water@@ -@@ absor@@ b@@ ent material like pe@@ at or bag@@ asse, so soil can hold this water and it stays mo@@ ist.
To grow, plants need water, sunlight and nutri@@ tion.
What if the soil doesn't have any nutrition in it?
We don't just add nutrition directly to the soil.
That would be the industrial way.
It goes against nature.
We instead add micro@@ organisms to the soil.
They produce the nutrients in the soil natur@@ ally.
They feed on the biomass we have mixed in the soil, so all they have to do is eat and multi@@ pl@@ y.
And as their number grow@@ s, the soil starts breathing again.
It becomes alive.
We survey the native tree species of the place.
How do we decide what's native or not?
Well, whatever existed before human intervention is n@@ ative.
That's the simple rule.
We survey a national park to find the last remains of a natural forest.
We survey the sacred gro@@ ves, or sacred forests around old templ@@ es.
And if we don't find anything at all, we go to muse@@ ums to see the seeds or wood of trees existing there a long time ago.
We research old paint@@ ings, poems and literature from the place, to identify the tree species belong@@ ing there.
Once we know our trees, we divide them in four different lay@@ er@@ s: sh@@ ru@@ b lay@@ er, sub-@@ tree lay@@ er, tree layer and canopy lay@@ er.
We fix the rati@@ os of each lay@@ er, and then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix@@ .
If we are making a fruit forest, we increase the percentage of fru@@ it-@@ be@@ aring trees.
It could be a flow@@ ering forest, a forest that attrac@@ ts a lot of birds or bees, or it could simply be a n@@ ative, wild ever@@ green forest.
We collect the seeds and ger@@ min@@ ate sa@@ pl@@ ings out of them.
We make sure that trees belong@@ ing to the same layer are not planted next to each other, or they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tal@@ l.
We plant the sa@@ pl@@ ings close to each other.
On the surface, we spread a thick layer of mul@@ ch, so when it's hot outside the soil stays mo@@ ist.
When it's cold, fr@@ ost formation happens only on the mul@@ ch, so soil can still breathe while it's free@@ zing outside.
The soil is very soft - so sof@@ t, that roots can penetr@@ ate into it eas@@ ily, rapid@@ ly.
I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ally, the forest doesn't seem like it's grow@@ ing, but it's growing under the surface.
In the first three months, roots reach a depth of one meter.
These roots form a mes@@ h, tightly holding the soil.
Mic@@ rob@@ es and fung@@ i live throughout this network of ro@@ ots.
So if some nutrition is not available in the vic@@ in@@ ity of a tree, these microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree.
Whenever it rain@@ s, mag@@ ically, mush@@ rooms appear over@@ night.
And this means the soil below has a healthy fung@@ al network.
Once these roots are establ@@ ished, forest starts growing on the surface.
As the forest grows we keep wat@@ ering it - for the next two to three years, we water the forest.
We want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees, so we remove the we@@ eds growing on the ground.
As this forest grow@@ s, it blocks the sun@@ light.
Eventu@@ ally, the forest becomes so dense that sunlight can't reach the ground anymore.
We@@ eds cannot grow now, because they need sunlight as well.
At this stage, every single drop of water that falls into the forest doesn't evapor@@ ate back into the atmosphere.
This dense forest conden@@ ses the mo@@ ist air and re@@ tains its mo@@ ist@@ ure.
We gradually reduce and eventually stop wat@@ ering the forest.
And even without water@@ ing, the forest floor stays mo@@ ist and sometimes even dark.
Now, when a single leaf falls on this forest floor, it immediately starts deca@@ ying.
This deca@@ yed biomass forms hum@@ us, which is food for the forest.
As the forest grow@@ s, more leaves fall on the surface - it means more hum@@ us is produc@@ ed, it means more food so the forest can grow still bigger.
And this forest keeps growing expon@@ enti@@ ally.
Once establ@@ ished, these forests are going to re@@ generate themselves again and again - probably forever.
In a natural forest like this, no management is the best manag@@ ement.
It's a tiny jung@@ le party.
This forest grows as a collec@@ tive.
If the same trees - same species - would have been planted independ@@ ently, it wouldn't grow so fast.
And this is how we create a 100@@ -year-old forest in just 10 years.
Thank you very much.
Emma M@@ arr@@ is: Nature is everywhere - we just need to learn to see it.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: How do you define "@@ nature@@ ?" If we define it as that which is un@@ touched by humans, then we won't have any left, says environmental writer Emma M@@ arr@@ is. She ur@@ ges us to consider a new definition of nature - one that includes not only pr@@ istine wil@@ der@@ ness but also the un@@ ten@@ ded pat@@ ches of plants growing in urban spaces - and encour@@ ages us to bring our children out to touch and tin@@ ker with it, so that one day they might love and protect it.
We are stealing nature from our children.
Now, when I say this, I don't mean that we are destroying nature that they will have wanted us to preser@@ ve, although that is unfortunately also the case.
What I mean here is that we've started to define nature in a way that's so pur@@ ist and so stric@@ t that under the definition we're creating for ourselves, there won't be any nature left for our children when they're adults.
But there's a fix for this.
So let me explain@@ .
Right now, humans use half of the world to live, to grow their crops and their tim@@ ber, to pas@@ ture their animals.
If you added up all the human beings, we would weigh 10 times as much as all the wild mammals put together.
We cut roads through the forest.
We have added little plastic particles to the sand on ocean be@@ ach@@ es.
We've changed the chemistry of the soil with our artificial fertiliz@@ ers.
And of course, we've changed the chemistry of the air.
So when you take your next breath, you'll be breathing in 42 percent more carbon dioxide than if you were breathing in 17@@ 50.
So all of these changes, and many others, have come to be kind of lum@@ ped together under this rub@@ ric of the "@@ An@@ thro@@ poc@@ en@@ e."
And this is a term that some ge@@ ologists are suggesting we should give to our current ep@@ oc@@ h, given how pervas@@ ive human influence has been over it.
Now, it's still just a proposed ep@@ oc@@ h, but I think it's a helpful way to think about the magnitude of human influence on the planet.
So where does this put nature@@ ?
What coun@@ ts as nature in a world where everything is influenced by hum@@ ans?
So 25 years ago, environmental writer Bill McK@@ ib@@ be@@ n said that because nature was a thing apart from man and because climate change meant that every centimeter of the Earth was altered by man, then nature was over.
In fact, he called his book "The E@@ nd of Nature@@ ."
I disagree with this. I just disagree with this.
I disagree with this definition of nature, because, fundament@@ ally, we are animals.
Right? Like, we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share a planet, and all the other plants, and all the other microb@@ es.
And so I think that nature is not that which is un@@ touched by humanity, man or woman.
I think that nature is anywhere where life thri@@ ves, anywhere where there are multiple species together, anywhere that's green and blue and thri@@ ving and filled with life and growing.
And under that definition, things look a little bit different.
Now, I understand that there are certain parts of this nature that speak to us in a special way.
Pl@@ ac@@ es like Yel@@ low@@ stone, or the Mong@@ ol@@ ian ste@@ p@@ pe, or the Great Bar@@ ri@@ er Re@@ ef or the Ser@@ en@@ ge@@ ti.
Pl@@ ac@@ es that we think of as kind of E@@ den@@ ic represent@@ ations of a nature before we scre@@ wed everything up.
And in a way, they are less impac@@ ted by our day to day activi@@ ties.
Many of these places have no roads or few roads, so on, like su@@ ch.
But ultimately, even these Ed@@ ens are deeply influenced by humans.
Now, let's just take North America, for example, since that's where we're meeting.
So between about 15,000 years ago when people first came here, they started a process of interacting with the nature that led to the extinction of a big sle@@ w of large-@@ bodi@@ ed animals, from the mas@@ tod@@ on to the giant ground slo@@ th, all of these cool animals that unfortunately are no longer with us.
And when those animals went extinc@@ t, you know, the ecosystems didn't stand still.
M@@ assi@@ ve ri@@ p@@ ple effects changed grass@@ lands into forests, changed the composition of forest from one tree to another.
So even in these E@@ den@@ s, even in these perfec@@ t-@@ looking places that seem to remind us of a past before humans, we're essentially looking at a human@@ ized landscape.
Not just these pre@@ historic humans, but historical humans, indigenous people all the way up until the moment when the first coloniz@@ ers showed up.
And the case is the same for the other contin@@ ents as well.
Hum@@ ans have just been involved in nature in a very influ@@ ential way for a very long time.
Now, just recently, someone told me, "Oh, but there are still wild plac@@ es."
And I said, "W@@ here? W@@ here? I want to go."
And he said, "The Amaz@@ on."
And I was like, "Oh, the Amaz@@ on. I was just there.
It's awesome. National Geographic sent me to Man@@ ú National Park, which is in the Per@@ u@@ vian Amazon, but it's a big ch@@ unk of rain@@ forest, un@@ clear@@ ed, no roads, protected as a national park, one of the most, in fact, bio@@ diverse parks in the world.
And when I got in there with my cano@@ e, what did I find, but people.
People have been living there for hundreds and thousands of years.
People live there, and they don't just float over the jung@@ le.
They have a meaningful relationship with the landscape.
They hun@@ t. They grow cro@@ ps.
They domes@@ tic@@ ate cro@@ ps.
They use the natural resources to build their houses, to that@@ ch their hous@@ es.
They even make pets out of animals that we consider to be wild animals.
These people are there and they're interacting with the environment in a way that's really meaningful and that you can see in the environment.
Now, I was with an anthrop@@ ologist on this tri@@ p, and he told me, as we were floating down the river, he said, "There are no demographic vo@@ ids in the Amaz@@ on."
This statement has really stuck with me, because what it means is that the whole Amazon is like this.
There's people everywhere.
And many other tropical forests are the same, and not just tropical forests.
People have influenced ecosystems in the past, and they continue to influence them in the present, even in places where they're harder to notic@@ e.
So, if all of the defini@@ tions of nature that we might want to use that involve it being un@@ touched by humanity or not having people in it, if all of those actually give us a result where we don't have any nature, then maybe they're the wrong defini@@ tions.
Maybe we should define it by the presence of multiple species, by the presence of a thri@@ ving life.
Now, if we do it that way, what do we get?
Well, it's this kind of mirac@@ le.
All of a sudden, there's nature all around us.
All of a sudden, we see this Mon@@ ar@@ ch cat@@ er@@ pill@@ ar mun@@ ching on this plant, and we realize that there it is, and it's in this empty lot in Ch@@ attan@@ o@@ og@@ a.
And look at this empty lot.
I mean, there@@ 's, like, probably, a doz@@ en, minim@@ um, plant species growing there, supporting all kinds of insect life, and this is a completely un@@ managed space, a completely wild space.
This is a kind of wild nature right under our nose, that we don't even notic@@ e.
And there's an interesting little paradox@@ , too.
So this nature, this kind of wil@@ d, un@@ ten@@ ded part of our urban@@ , peri@@ -@@ urban@@ , sub@@ urban agricultural existence that flies under the rad@@ ar, it's argu@@ ably more wild than a national park, because national parks are very carefully managed in the 21st century.
C@@ ra@@ ter Lake in southern Oreg@@ on, which is my closest national park, is a beautiful example of a landscape that seems to be coming out of the past.
But they're managing it careful@@ ly.
One of the issues they have now is white bar@@ k p@@ ine di@@ e-@@ off.
White bar@@ k p@@ ine is a beautiful, char@@ is@@ matic - I'll say it's a char@@ is@@ matic meg@@ af@@ l@@ ora that grows up at high altitude - and it's got all these problems right now with disease.
There's a bl@@ ister r@@ ust that was introduc@@ ed, bar@@ k beet@@ le.
So to deal with this, the park service has been planting rus@@ t-@@ resistant white bar@@ k p@@ ine se@@ ed@@ l@@ ings in the park, even in areas that they are otherwise managing as wil@@ der@@ ness.
And they're also putting out beet@@ le rep@@ ell@@ ent in key areas as I saw last time I went hi@@ king there.
And this kind of thing is really much more common than you would think.
National parks are heavily manag@@ ed.
The wildlife is kept to a certain population size and structure.
Fire@@ s are sup@@ pres@@ sed.
Fire@@ s are started.
N@@ on-@@ native species are remo@@ ved.
Native species are re@@ introduc@@ ed.
And in fact, I took a look, and Ban@@ ff National Park is doing all of the things I just lis@@ te@@ d: sup@@ pressing fire, having fire, radi@@ o-@@ col@@ lar@@ ing wol@@ ves, re@@ introducing bis@@ on.
It takes a lot of work to make these places look un@@ touch@@ ed.
And in a further iron@@ y, these places that we love the most are the places that we love a little too hard, sometimes.
A lot of us like to go there, and because we're managing them to be stable in the face of a changing planet, they often are becoming more fragile over time.
Which means that they're the absolute worst places to take your children on vac@@ ation, because you can't do anything there.
You can't climb the trees. You can't fish the fish.
You can't make a camp@@ fire out in the middle of nowhere.
You can't take home the pin@@ econ@@ es.
There are so many rules and restric@@ tions that from a child's point of view, this is, like, the worst nature ever.
Because children don't want to hi@@ ke through a beautiful landscape for five hours and then look at a beautiful view.
That's maybe what we want to do as adults, but what kids want to do is hun@@ ker down in one spot and just tin@@ ker with it, just work with it, just pick it up, build a house, build a for@@ t, do something like that.
Ad@@ di@@ tion@@ ally, these sort of E@@ den@@ ic places are often distant from where people live.
And they're expensive to get to. They're hard to vis@@ it.
So this means that they're only available to the el@@ ites, and that's a real problem.
The Nature Conserv@@ ancy did a survey of young people, and they asked them, how often do you spend time out@@ door@@ s?
And only two out of five spent time out@@ doors at least once a week.
The other three out of five were just staying inside.
And when they asked them why, what are the barriers to going outside, the response of 6@@ 1 percent was, "There are no natural areas near my home@@ ."
And this is crazy. This is just pat@@ ently fal@@ se.
I mean, 7@@ 1 percent of people in the US live within a 10-@@ minute walk of a city park.
And I'm sure the figures are similar in other countries.
And that doesn't even count your back gar@@ den, the urban cre@@ e@@ k, the empty lot.
Everybody lives near nature.
Every kid lives near nature.
We've just somehow forgotten how to see it.
We've spent too much time watching David At@@ ten@@ bor@@ ough document@@ aries where the nature is really sexy - and we've forgotten how to see the nature that is literally right outside our door, the nature of the street tree.
So here's an example: Philadelph@@ ia.
There's this cool elev@@ ated rail@@ way that you can see from the ground, that's been abandon@@ ed.
Now, this may sound like the beginning of the High L@@ ine story in Manhattan, and it's very similar, except they haven't developed this into a park yet, although they're working on it.
So for now, it's still this little sort of secret wil@@ der@@ ness in the heart of Philadelph@@ ia, and if you know where the hole is in the chain@@ -l@@ ink f@@ ence, you can scr@@ am@@ ble up to the top and you can find this completely wild me@@ adow just floating above the city of Philadelph@@ ia.
Every single one of these plants grew from a seed This is completely autonom@@ ous, self-@@ wil@@ led nature.
And it's right in the middle of the city.
And they've sent people up there to do sort of bios@@ ur@@ ve@@ ys, and there are over 50 plant species up there.
And it's not just plants.
This is an eco@@ system, a functioning eco@@ system.
It's creating soil. It's sequ@@ ester@@ ing carb@@ on.
There's pollin@@ ation going on.
I mean, this is really an eco@@ system.
So scientists have started calling ecosystems like these "@@ novel eco@@ system@@ s," because they're often dominated by non-@@ native species, and because they're just super weir@@ d.
They're just unlike anything we've ever seen before.
For so long, we dis@@ missed all these novel ecosystems as tr@@ ash.
We're talking about reg@@ ro@@ wn agricultural fiel@@ ds, tim@@ ber plant@@ ations that are not being managed on a day@@ -to-@@ day basis, secon@@ d-@@ growth forests gener@@ ally, the entire East Co@@ ast, where after agriculture moved west, the forest spr@@ ung up.
And of course, pretty much all of Hawai@@ i, where novel ecosystems are the nor@@ m, where exotic species totally domin@@ ate.
This forest here has Que@@ ens@@ land ma@@ ple, it has s@@ word fer@@ ns from Sou@@ theast Asia.
You can make your own novel eco@@ system, too. It's really simple.
You just stop mo@@ wing your la@@ wn.
Il@@ k@@ ka Hans@@ ki was an ecolog@@ ist in Fin@@ land, and he did this experiment himself.
He just stopped mo@@ wing his la@@ wn, and after a few years, he had some gr@@ ad students come, and they did sort of a bio-@@ b@@ lit@@ z of his backyar@@ d, and they found 3@@ 75 plant species, including two endangered species.
So when you're up there on that future High L@@ ine of Philadelph@@ ia, surrounded by this wild@@ ness, surrounded by this diversity, this abund@@ ance, this vibr@@ ance, you can look over the side and you can see a local play@@ ground for a local school, and that's what it looks like.
You know, under my definition, there's a lot of the planet that coun@@ ts as nature, but this would be one of the few places that wouldn't count as nature.
There's nothing there except humans, no other plants, no other animals.
And what I really wanted to do was just, like, throw a lad@@ der over the side and get all these kids to come up with me into this cool me@@ ado@@ w.
In a way, I feel like this is the choice that faces us.
If we dis@@ miss these new nature@@ s as not acceptable or tr@@ ash@@ y or no good, we might as well just p@@ ave them over.
And in a world where everything is changing, we need to be very careful about how we define nature.
In order not to steal it from our children, we have to do two things.
First, we cannot define nature as that which is un@@ touch@@ ed.
This never made any sense anyway.
Nature has not been un@@ touched for thousands of years.
And it exclu@@ des most of the nature that most people can visit and have a relationship with, including only nature that children cannot touch.
Which brings me to the second thing that we have to do, which is that we have to let children touch nature, because that which is un@@ touched is un@@ lo@@ ved.
We face some pretty gri@@ m environmental challenges on this planet.
Climate change is among them.
There's others to@@ o: habitat loss is my favorite thing to fre@@ ak out about in the middle of the night.
But in order to solve them, we need people - smart, dedicated people - who care about nature.
And the only way we're going to raise up a generation of people who care about nature is by letting them touch nature.
I have a Fort The@@ ory of E@@ colog@@ y, Fort The@@ ory of Conserv@@ ation.
Every ecolog@@ ist I know, every conservation biologist I know, every conservation professional I know, built for@@ ts when they were kids.
If we have a generation that doesn't know how to build a for@@ t, we'll have a generation that doesn't know how to care about nature.
And I don't want to be the one to tell this kid, who is on a special program that takes Philadelph@@ ia kids from poor neighborhoods and takes them to city par@@ ks, I don't want to be the one to tell him that the flower he's holding is a non-@@ native invasive we@@ ed that he should throw away as tr@@ ash.
I think I would much rather learn from this boy that no matter where this plant comes from, it is beautiful, and it deserves to be touched and appreci@@ ated.
Thank you.
Ger@@ ard Ry@@ le: How the Pan@@ ama P@@ aper@@ s journalists broke the biggest le@@ ak in history.
TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Ger@@ ard Ry@@ le led the international team that divul@@ ged the Pan@@ ama P@@ aper@@ s, the 1@@ 1.5 million lea@@ ked documents from 40 years of activity of the Pan@@ am@@ ani@@ an law firm M@@ oss@@ ack F@@ on@@ seca that have offered an unprecedented glimpse into the scope and methods of the secre@@ tive world of off@@ shore fin@@ ance. He@@ ar the story behind the biggest collaborative journ@@ alism project in history.
What do you do if you had to figure out the information behind 1@@ 1.5 million document@@ s, ver@@ ify it and make sense of it?
That was a challenge that a group of journalists had to face late last year.
An anonymous person calling himself John Do@@ e had somehow managed to copy nearly 40 years of records of the Pan@@ am@@ ani@@ an law firm M@@ oss@@ ack F@@ on@@ se@@ ca.
This is one of many fir@@ ms around the world that speci@@ alize in setting up accounts in off@@ shore tax hav@@ ens like the British Virgin Is@@ lands, for rich and powerful people who like to keep secre@@ ts.
John Do@@ e had managed to copy every spread@@ sheet from this fir@@ m, every client fi@@ le, every email, from 197@@ 7 to the present day.
It represented the biggest cac@@ he of inside information into the tax hav@@ en system that anyone had ever seen.
But it also presented a gig@@ antic challenge to investig@@ ative journ@@ alism.
Think about it: 1@@ 1.5 million document@@ s, contain@@ ing the secrets of people from more than 200 different countries.
Where do you start with such a vast res@@ our@@ ce?
Where do you even begin to tell a story that can tra@@ il off into every corner of the globe, and that can affect almost any person in any language, sometimes in ways they don't even know yet.
John Do@@ e had given the information to two journalists at the German newspaper S@@ ü@@ d@@ de@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Ze@@ it@@ un@@ g.
He said he was motivated by - and I quote - "The scale of the in@@ justice that the documents would reve@@ al."
But one user alone can never make sense of such a vast amount of information.
So the S@@ ü@@ d@@ de@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Ze@@ it@@ ung reached out to my organization in Washington, D@@ C, The International Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um of Investi@@ g@@ ative Journ@@ al@@ ists.
We decided to do something that was the very opposite of everything we'd been taught to do as journal@@ ist@@ s: share.
By nature, investig@@ ative repor@@ ters are l@@ one wol@@ ves.
We fier@@ c@@ ely guard our secre@@ ts, at times even from our editor@@ s, because we know that the moment we tell them what we have, they'll want that story right away.
And to be fran@@ k, when you get a good story, you like to keep the gl@@ ory to yourself.
But there's no doubt that we live in a shrin@@ king world, and that the media has largely been slow to wake up to this.
The issues we report on are more and more trans@@ nation@@ al.
Gi@@ ant corporations operate on a global level.
Environ@@ mental and health crises are global.
So, too, are financial flows and financial cris@@ es.
So it seems stagger@@ ing that journ@@ alism has been so late to cover stories in a truly global way.
And it also seems stagger@@ ing that journ@@ alism has been so slow to wake up to the possibilities that technology br@@ ings, rather than being frighten@@ ed of it.
The reason journalists are scared of technology is this: the profession@@ 's largest institutions are going through tough times because of the changing way that people are consuming news.
The advertising business models that have sustain@@ ed reporting are broken.
And this has pl@@ un@@ ged journ@@ alism into crisis, forcing those institutions to re@@ examine how they function.
But where there is crisis, there is also opportunity.
The first challenge presented by what would eventually become known as the Pan@@ ama P@@ aper@@ s was to make the documents search@@ able and read@@ able.
There were nearly five million ema@@ ils, two million PD@@ F@@ s that needed to be scan@@ ned and inde@@ x@@ ed, and millions more fil@@ es and other kinds of document@@ s.
They all needed to be hou@@ sed in a safe and secure location in the cloud.
We next invited repor@@ ters to have a look at the document@@ s.
In all, repor@@ ters from more than 100 media organizations in 76 countries - from the B@@ BC in Britain to L@@ e M@@ onde newspaper in France to the A@@ sa@@ hi Sh@@ im@@ bu@@ n in Japan.
"N@@ ative eyes on native nam@@ es," we called it, the idea being, who best to tell you who was important to Nigeria than a Nigerian journal@@ ist@@ ?
Who best in Canada than a Canadi@@ an?
There were only two rules for everyone who was invi@@ te@@ d: we all agreed to share everything that we found with everybody else, and we all agreed to publish together on the same day.
We chose our media partners based on trust that had been built up through previous smaller collabor@@ ations and also from leads that jumped out from the document@@ s.
Over the next few months, my small nonprofit organization of less than 20 people was joined by more than 350 other repor@@ ters from 25 language groups.
The biggest information le@@ ak in history had now s@@ pa@@ wn@@ ed the biggest journ@@ alism collaboration in histor@@ y: 3@@ 76 sets of native eyes doing what journalists normally never do, working shoulder to shoulder, sharing information, but telling no one.
For it became clear at this point that in order to make the biggest kind of nois@@ e, we first needed the biggest kind of silence.
To manage the project over the many months it would take, we built a secure virtual news@@ room.
We used encryp@@ ted communication systems, and we built a speci@@ ally designed search engine.
In@@ side the virtual news@@ room, the repor@@ ters could gather around the them@@ es that were emerging from the document@@ s.
Those interested in blood diamon@@ ds or exotic art, for instance, could share information about how the off@@ shore world was being used to hide the trade in both of those commodi@@ ties.
Those interested in s@@ port could share information about how famous sports stars were putting their image rights into off@@ shore companies, thereby likely avoid@@ ing taxes in the countries where they pli@@ ed their trade.
But perhaps most exciting of all were the number of world leaders and elec@@ t politicians that were emerging from the documents - figures like Pe@@ tro Por@@ os@@ h@@ en@@ ko in Ukrain@@ e, close associ@@ ates of V@@ lad@@ im@@ ir P@@ uti@@ n in Russia and the British Prime Min@@ is@@ ter, David Camer@@ on, who is linked through his late father, I@@ an Camer@@ on.
Bu@@ ried in the documents were secret off@@ shore enti@@ ties, such as W@@ intr@@ is In@@ c@@ ., a company in the British Virgin Is@@ lands that had actually belong@@ ed to the sitting Icel@@ an@@ dic prime minis@@ ter.
I like to refer to Joh@@ ann@@ es Kr@@ ist@@ j@@ ans@@ son, the Icel@@ an@@ dic repor@@ ter we invited to join the project, as the lon@@ eli@@ est man in the world.
For nine months, he refused paid work and lived off the ear@@ nings of his wife.
He pas@@ ted tar@@ ps over the windows of his home to prevent pr@@ ying eyes during the long Icel@@ an@@ dic winter@@ .
And he soon ran out of ex@@ cus@@ es to explain his many ab@@ s@@ ences, as he worked red@@ -@@ ey@@ ed, night after night, month after month.
In all that time, he sat on information that would eventually bring down the leader of his country.
Now, when you're an investig@@ ative repor@@ ter and you make an amazing discovery, such as your prime min@@ ster can be linked to a secret off@@ shore company, that that company has a financial interest in Icel@@ an@@ dic banks - the very issue he's been elected on - well, your instinct is to scre@@ am out very lou@@ d.
Instead, as one of the few people that he could speak to, Joh@@ ann@@ es and I shared a kind of gal@@ lows humor.
"W@@ intr@@ is is com@@ ing," he used to say.
We were big f@@ ans of "G@@ ame of Th@@ ron@@ es."
When repor@@ ters like Joh@@ ann@@ es wanted to scre@@ am, they did so inside the virtual news@@ room, and then they turned those scre@@ ams into stories by going outside the documents to court recor@@ ds, official company regis@@ ters, and by eventually putting questions to those that we intended to name.
Pan@@ ama P@@ aper@@ s actually allowed the repor@@ ters to look at the world through a different lens from everybody else.
As we were researching the story, un@@ connected to us, a major political bri@@ ber@@ y s@@ cand@@ al happened in Brazil.
A new leader was elected in Argent@@ ina.
The FBI began to indic@@ t officials at FI@@ F@@ A, the organization that controls the world of professional soc@@ cer.
The Pan@@ ama P@@ aper@@ s actually had unique insights into each one of these un@@ folding events.
So you can imagine the pressure and the ego dram@@ as that could have ru@@ ined what we were trying to do.
Any of one of these journal@@ ists, they could have broken the pac@@ t.
But they didn't.
And on A@@ pri@@ l 3 this year, at exactly 8@@ p@@ m German time, we published simultane@@ ously in 76 countries.
The Pan@@ ama P@@ aper@@ s quickly became one of the biggest stories of the year.
This is the scene in Icel@@ and the day after we publ@@ ished.
It was the first of many protest@@ s.
The Icel@@ an@@ dic prime minister had to res@@ ig@@ n.
It was a first of many res@@ ign@@ ations.
We spot@@ ligh@@ ted many famous people such as L@@ ion@@ el M@@ ess@@ i, the most famous soccer player in the world.
And there were some unintended consequences.
These al@@ leg@@ ed members of a Mexican drug car@@ tel were arrested after we published details about their h@@ ide@@ out.
They'd been using the address to reg@@ ister their off@@ shore company.
There's a kind of irony in what we've been able to do.
The technology - the Internet - that has broken the business model is allowing us to reinvent journ@@ alism itself.
And this dynamic is producing unprecedented levels of transparency and impact.
We showed how a group of journalists can effect change across the world by applying new methods and old-@@ fashion@@ ed journ@@ alism techniques to vast amounts of lea@@ ked information.
We put all-@@ important context around what was given to us by John Do@@ e.
And by sharing resources, we were able to dig deep - much deeper and longer than most media organizations allow these days, because of financial concer@@ ns.
Now, it was a big risk, and it wouldn't work for every story, but we showed with the Pan@@ ama P@@ aper@@ s that you can write about any country from just about anywhere, and then choose your prefer@@ red battle@@ ground to defend your work.
Try obtain@@ ing a court in@@ jun@@ c@@ tion that would prevent the telling of a story in 76 different countries.
Try stopping the inevit@@ able.
S@@ hor@@ tly after we published, I got a three-@@ word text from Joh@@ ann@@ es: "W@@ intr@@ is has arri@@ ve@@ d."
It had arrived and so, too, perhaps has a new era for journ@@ alism.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Ger@@ ard, thank you.
I guess you're going to send that appl@@ a@@ use to the 350 journalists who worked with you, right?
Now, a couple of questions I would like to ask.
The first one is, you'd been working in secre@@ cy for over a year with 3@@ 50-@@ something colleagues from all over the world - was there ever a moment when you thought that the le@@ ak may be le@@ ak@@ ed, that the collaboration may just be broken by somebody publishing a stor@@ y?
Or somebody not in the group releasing some information that they got to know?
Ger@@ ard Ry@@ le: We had a series of crises along the way, including when something major was happening in the world, the journalists from that country wanted to publish right away.
We had to calm them down.
Probably the biggest crisis we had was a week before public@@ ation.
We'd sent a series of questions to the associ@@ ates of V@@ lad@@ im@@ ir P@@ ut@@ in, but instead of respond@@ ing, the K@@ rem@@ lin actually held a press conference and den@@ ounc@@ ed us, and den@@ ounc@@ ed the whole thing as being, I guess, a plot from the West.
At that point, P@@ uti@@ n thought it was just about him.
And, of course, a lot of edit@@ ors around the world were very nervous about this. They thought the story was going to get out.
You can imagine the amount of time they'd sp@@ ent, the amount of resources, money spent on this.
So I had to basically spend the last week cal@@ ming everyone down, a bit like a general, where you're holding your troops back@@ : "C@@ al@@ m, remain cal@@ m."
And then eventually, of course, they all did.
BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so, you released a lot of the documents as an open database for everybody to search via key@@ word, essenti@@ ally.
G@@ R: We very much believe that the basic information about the off@@ shore world should be made public.
Now, we didn't publish the underlying documents of the journalists we're working with.
But the basic information such as the name of a person, what their off@@ shore company was and the name of that company, is now all available online.
In fact, the biggest resource of its kind basically is out there now BG: Ger@@ ard, thank you for the work you do.
G@@ R: Thank you.
